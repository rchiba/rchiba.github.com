      <p>
        In 2011 I co-founded a company called Hypemarks. We raised $370k in 2012. After a year with no traction and at the brink of bankrupcy, we pivoted and launched TINT in 2013. We hit break-even in 5 months and over the next 5 years bootstrapped it to $5M ARR with 30 people. In 2018, we sold it to a company called <a href="https://filestack.com">Filestack</a> and walked away from the company with a successful exit. The company continues to this day, owned and operated by a new team.

      <div class="project-box-header">The Still-Abridged but Slightly Longer Story</div>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.timsaekoo.com/">Tim Sae Koo</a> was the guy who brought us all together. He was a business school student working on a class project that bloomed into an exciting obsession. His idea was to create a better way to share links with friends and it was called Hypemarks. We pitched it as a new way to "Discover the Web with Friends". 
      </p>
      <p>
        We were lucky in many ways to get our initial funding. The founder of <a href="https://www.idealab.com/">Idealab</a>, Bill Gross, had been working on a pet project similar to Hypemarks and happened to be at a demo day when we were presenting. He invested in us and we started working from their office in Pasadena immediately after graduating from USC. One of the other founders, Willy, lived nearby so the five of us lived in Willy's house for that summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        As summer turned into fall and no-one was signing up for Hypemarks, we considered our options. We were paying ourselves minimum wage, but still our runway continued to shorten. At around the same time, we decided that big changes needed to happen. Luckily, a single user on the Hypemarks platform gave us a nugget of insight that pointed us in the right direction. A music management agency called The Collective really liked a specific feature we built: the ability to automatically import links from social media. They wanted us to build them a Hypemarks profile that they could embed on the site of one of their clients, Toni Braxton, so that her site could be continuously updated with fresh content from social.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging by how much more interested they were in our feature compared to every other use of Hypemarks, we decided to pivot the company. We started building a new product called TINT in addition to moving to San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I was trying to find ways for the product to get initial traction, I started learning about SEO. I found a technique that other companies like Yelp and Tripadvisor had used which involved creating "badges" that hotels and restaurants would put on their site. These badges linked back to Yelp or Tripadvisor, boosting their authority in search. I realized that because our product is just like a "badge", we could do the same thing. I added a "powered by TINT" badge to our embedded widget which linked back to landing pages that targetted specific keywords like "instagram widget". After a month, we saw significant traffic that kept growing.
      </p>

        Unfortunately, at around the same time, we had

      <p>
        The TINT journey wasn't without its downs. In 2016 we went through layoffs due to an unexpected plateau in our revenue. The weekend after, I went to a nearby coffee shop and wrote a blog post titled, "<a target="_blank" href="http://ryochiba.com/2016/06/08/tough-times-dont-last-but-tough-startups-do.html">Tough Times Don't Last But Tough Startups Do"</a> In it, I described the feeling of laying off a close friend and shared the decisions and financials that led to the situation. The story was picked up by the Wall Street Journal and they put together a story that was published in the paper on July 20th 2016. It's obviously bittersweet to have had my 15 minutes of news fame be from the misfortune of our team, but I'm also grateful to have stayed true to my values of truth and openness.

      <div class="project-box-header">Company Culture</div>
      <p>
        One of my proudest accomplishments is one that can't be put in a neat bullet point list: Helping to create a vibrant company culture. Obviously, the lion's share of the credit goes to both the financial well-being of the company, the unique perspectives each member of the team, and our wonderful Operations team. I like to think that we as the leadership team helped in some way to keep culture top of mind in the best of times and worst of times. I wonder sometimes about the net effect. Some employees walked away with a positive experience and others were resentful. However, I believe that most of the team grew from the experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm in doubt, I like to look at the artifacts of the culture we created, like photos from the hackathons we organized, the culture-focused blog posts we wrote, or the creative "Day in the Life" videos we made to show candidates what our work experience was like. Our operations manager Jessica Simmons put together a snapshot of highlights before she left which has some gems.

        TINT has some great customers that used our product in all sorts of applications. I was lucky to have worked on a product that became so visible. These case studies illustrate how customers actually used our product.
