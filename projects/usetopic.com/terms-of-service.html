Term, Termination, Suspension<br><br>8.1 Term.</strong> The initial term of each Order begins on Order effective date and continues for the period stated in the Order.

Your breach of the Agreement more than three (3) times in any twelve (12) month period is material even if each individual breach is not, and Topic may terminate for breach on such grounds, even if each breach has been cured. Topic may terminate an Order and the Agreement at any time on summary written notice if you or your personnel are abusive to Topic personnel.<br><br>‍<strong>8.3 Suspension.</strong> Topic may suspend your access to the Services and Your Content during any period that you are in material breach of the Agreement or your access to the Services or Your Content creates a material security vulnerability. Topic will give you at least two (2) business days’ advance notice of the suspension, unless the suspension is made under emergency circumstances. Topic will reinstate your access to the Services when the grounds for suspension are cured unless Topic has already terminated the Agreement as described in this Section.<br><br>‍<strong>8.4 Surviving Provisions.</strong> The following sections survive expiration or termination of the Agreement: Fees and Payment, Confidential Information, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Term and Termination, Content and Data, Suspension, Governing Law, Disputes, Notices, General, and any other terms that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination.<br><br>‍<strong>8.5 Return of Your Original Content.</strong> You are responsible for exporting Your Original Content from the Services prior to expiration of the Agreement. If Topic terminates your Services for breach, Topic will retain Your Original Content for at least 15 days from the effective date of termination. If you wish to export Your Original Content following a termination for breach, Topic will either, at its option, enable short term access to the Services at a scheduled time so that you may export Your Original Content, or export Your Original Content using its standard export tools. Topic has no obligation to retain Your Original Content after the 15-day period and may destroy Your Original Content.<br><br>‍<strong>9. Remedies, Disclaimers, Indemnification, Limitations<br><br>9.1 Warranty Disclaimer. The Topic Services are provided AS IS. Topic disclaims any implied warranties, such as a warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and any representation or warranty that may arise through a course of dealing. You acknowledge that the use of the Service may not be uninterrupted, error free, or completely secure.</strong> If applicable law requires Topic to make a warranty notwithstanding this disclaimer, then the warranty is made for a period of thirty (30) days from the date that it is deemed to have been made, and your sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of the warranty is a refund of fees paid for the Services covered by the warranty. You represent that you have not relied on any representation or warranty other than those stated in the Agreement.<br><br>‍<strong>9.2 Indemnification.</strong> You agree that if a third party asserts a legal claim against Topic or any of its officers, members, managers, employees, staff, personnel, agents, licensors or suppliers (each a “<strong>Topic Person</strong>“) arising from your use of the Services or any violation of these Services Terms or any Order, including your breach of a representation or warranty on any basis other than the gross negligence or misconduct of a Topic Person, you will pay all reasonable costs of defending the claim, including reasonable attorney fees, and pay any damages awarded to the third party or paid to the third party by Topic as a reasonable settlement. You agree that Topic may control the defense of the claim at its option, or may require you to defend the claim directly. If Topic elects to control the defense of the claim, you will reimburse Topic for its reasonable defense costs and expenses as incurred.<br><br>‍<strong>9.3 Limitation of Liability.</strong> In the event you have a legal claim against any of the Topic Persons, you agree that the maximum total amount of money you can recover from any or all of them cannot exceed the amount of fees you have paid or that are payable for Service for the three (3) months prior to the date the claim arose, unless the legal claim is based on a Topic Person’s intentional misconduct or is for personal injury or death resulting from the negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct of a Topic Person.

For clarity, information you learn about Topic or its Services as part of the relationship contemplated by this Agreement is Topic’s Confidential Information. Recipient agrees not to use or disclose the discloser’s Confidential Information except to provide or use the Services, as applicable, or to exercise legal rights or obligations in connection with the Agreement. Recipient shall use reasonable care to protect the discloser’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure. Topic’s use of reasonable care as to your Confidential Information that is part of Your Content is met by the use of the safeguards described in the Security Materials. Recipient shall return or destroy the discloser’s Confidential Information on request, except as necessary for reasonable and customary business record-keeping purposes. Recipient is responsible for a breach of this Section by any person to whom it has disclosed the discloser’s Confidential Information to the same extent as for its own breach of this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Topic may disclose your Confidential Information in response to a subpoena, request from law enforcement, or as otherwise required by law.<br><br>‍<strong>12.5 Security.</strong> On request, Topic will make available its materials describing its security safeguards and related audit and compliance reports (the “Security Materials”).

Topic is not responsible to you or your users for any harm or damage resulting from a security incident except to the extent the security incident resulted from Topic’ failure to provide the security safeguards described in the Security Materials. You are responsible for determining if Topic’s security safeguards meet any regulatory requirements applicable to you and otherwise meet your business and security requirements.<br><br>‍<strong>12.6 Governing Law.</strong> The Order and these Services Terms are governed by and should be interpreted under the laws of the State of California, and the United States of America, as applicable, without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction.

The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned award with findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Agreement, or to enforce or vacate an arbitration award. <strong>Each party waives any right to a trial by jury, and agrees that disputes will be resolved through arbitration. No claim subject to this provision may be brought as a class or collective action, nor may you assert such a claim as a member of a class or collective action that is brought by another claimant.</strong> Each party agrees not bring a claim related to the Services or the subject matter of an Order or these Services Terms more than two years after the time that the claim accrued.
