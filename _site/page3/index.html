<blockquote style="margin-top: -25px;">This is what it feels like when you're starting college. Uncertain, unbalanced, silly. But you can't say it's not fun!</blockquote>
I hope over the next few days, I'll have remembered most of my list. It's mainly for my sister, who is going to college soon. Apologies for the total lack of structure.
<ul>
	<li>Figure out one special thing about yourself and brace yourself for endless icebreakers.</li>
	<li>The more honest you feel when you tell a stranger what your major is, the closer you are to the right one.</li>
	<li>Do things for your friends. They will do things for you. If they do not, reconsider the friendship.</li>
	<li>If you were waiting for a chance to do something exciting and unexpected, now is the time.</li>
	<li>Organize and store every digital document you receive and complete from class. They will occasionally come in handy if you forget something you've learned (which will happen often).</li>
	<li>Along with the above, backup your files regularly.</li>
	<li>Buy a backpack that can fit a week's worth of groceries.</li>
	<li>The grades you get in your first semester count the same as the grades in your last.</li>
	<li>Buy two locks for your bike, lock the front wheel to your frame and the frame to a fixed object.</li>
	<li>Get two bank accounts. One at a national bank and one at the university credit union. Use the national bank for the ATM's, and the credit union for all other services.</li>
	<li>Get into museums for free. Feel good.</li>
	<li>Learn basic life skills. Like how to feed and clean yourself. (You would be surprised at how many people refuse to do this).</li>
</ul>

I was watching some videos on YUI theater when I came across an inspiring talk on the future and on Disneyland by Douglas Crockford. Who knew that the man behind JSON was a big Disney fan? And who knew Disney was a big fan of combating urban sprawl and suburbanization? <em>So much so that he was in the process of constructing an autonomously-governed experimental city</em>? I can't wait to go to Disneyland again to appreciate a dream that was all but forgotten, but is in the process of returning. If you have a spare lunch break, grab some food and watch this lecture.

I enjoyed this snippet:
<blockquote>Main Street is the first thing you see when you enter Disneyland, and when the park opened this only appeared to be about 50 years old. It wasn't an ancient city, it wasn't a fantasy city, it was meant to look like something that we had recently lost. Most cities still had buildings that looked like this except now they were in serious disrepair, or boarded up, or failing, or collapsing, or may have already been replaced by ugly post-War buildings. He was trying to set this up with some gentle nostalgia — remember just a few decades ago how wonderful cities were? How you could walk around and do lots of things? There's shopping, there's entertainment, there's retail. It's all there and you can just walk around, and it's really pleasant.</blockquote>

				    <h4>April  5, 2011</h4>
				    <p>
				    	So, after having recently read "<a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/" target="_blank">The Happiness Project</a>" by Gretchen Rubin, I was inspired by her attempts at "living in the moment" to take a walk around my neighborhood. I think there is something to be admired in the ability to savor seemingly insignificant moments of life. And how there are a lot of aesthetically rich things that on first glance seem too obvious to be noticed.

So let's start at the start: The House

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1308" title="house" src="/files/house.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="415" />

This is where I currently live. Built in 1909, it is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Craftsman" target="_blank">American Craftsman Style</a> home with an appraised value of $282,000, which I currently rent a room out of for about $700 a month. There are actually a number of these homes in the neighborhood, about evenly spaced out, indicating what the original plot sizes were. It takes some imagination, but it's fun to think about what this neighborhood must have been like in the early 20th century.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1309" title="house2" src="/files/house2.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="404" />

Today, there are many other styles of architecture that fill in the gaps. Spanish colonial stucco boxes, the occasional Victorian, and even Neoclassical White House replicas. It all reflects Los Angeles' motto: Built whatever you want, wherever you want to. Other LA Themes: Poverty embellished in luxury, in-your-face diversity, eccentricity.

&nbsp;

<a href="/files/dog.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1310" title="dog" src="/files/dog.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="319" /></a>

The distrust of the city seeps out in exclamatory signs people post in front of their homes. Warning! security dog. No trespassing! Thankfully, an occasional guard chihuahua sheds a comical light on it all.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1311" title="citrus" src="/files/citrus.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="415" />

These very scattered grid of houses are actually very dense with nature. Comparing the size of the trees in front of each lot is an easy way to gauge the age of a house. What's very pleasant is the frequency of citrus trees. Although, <a href="http://www.jgeoff.com/godfather/oranges.html" target="_blank">maybe not</a> after watching the Godfather.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1312" title="house3" src="/files/house3.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="415" />

Although at first it feels a little unsafe to *not* be surrounded in complete McMansion homogeneity, the uncouth nature of the neighborhood makes for a great walk. Seeing the diverse textures of different ages of paint, all coated in with the stains of city grit. You never know what you're going to see next.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1313" title="bird" src="/files/bird.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="415" />

One example is the literal animal house two houses across from where I live. Their property is home to a number of ducks, rabbits, exotic birds, and chickens. Something you'd never find in typical suburbia.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1314" title="alley" src="/files/alley.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="415" />

Of course, some parts are off limits. The occasional restricted alleyway adds to the mystery: What has this alleyway seen in the past century?

My experience living in South Central LA has been mixed. Among many things, I have returned home to:
<ul>
	<li>An old car parked in front of our house, in flames</li>
	<li>Four individuals being arrested by LAPD against our fence</li>
	<li>Homeless people looking through our trash</li>
</ul>
But, a couple of nights ago, I returned to something pretty neat: LED Streetlights. For once, thumbs up, LA!

I made one of these widgets for Ryan a couple months ago, but unfortunately didn't have any time to play with it myself before shipping it off.

After a winter break of back-of-the-mind curiosity, I finally caved in and bought a kit for myself.

Here are some notes on my experiences with it.

What is it?

The brain machine consists of two LED's that rapidly flash into your eyes and an apparatus that plays binaural beats through headphones. It claims to <em> </em>

<em> </em>

<em>
<blockquote>Relax and rejuvenate as your brain synchronizes to a wonderful meditative state, and enjoy as you hallucinate beautiful colors and patterns from your subconscious mind!</blockquote>
</em>

<em></em>

<em></em>Although the claims bring to mind the days of the snake oil salesman, the machine is actually mildly entertaining. According to the build page, the program in the chip lasts for 14 minutes. Here's a brief narrative of my 14 minute experience:

<em><strong>Glasses on.</strong> So here I am, typing this out while this thing flashes in my face.The first thing you notice is how annoying the sound is, but it works in keeping out most, if not all, outside noise, which I assume helps you focus. Every minute or so, the tone of the sound and the frequency of flashing changes. What I see is akin to the sensations when you press your fingers gently against your closed eyes, but without the feeling of physical discomfort. The flashing causes red and blue checkerboards that quickly alternate. To focus on the visual sensation is a little fatiguing, so after awhile you notice that you start to zone out so much that you don't even realize that there are colors t all. And I think that's when you start to relax the most. But so far, nothing revelatory. Just feeling a little disconnected from the world, with the only thing tying me here the sensation of the keys against my fingertips.  Turned off the machine. I hear strange artifacts like the sound of a garbled bubbling. This lasts about 10-20 seconds, but then everything's back to normal. <strong>Glasses off.</strong></em>
