Folsom St. was steep, but I made it to my new temporary pad. 

Feeling a little lonely. For the first time in awhile. Reminds me of my first night at USC. But so far, everything has been positive. The people in my new apartment are friendly, there's a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryochiba/5724943799/in/photostream" target="_blank">wonderful hill/park</a> in the backyard, and I ate a real burrito for lunch today. I can't tell if the knot in my gut is from the nervous anticipation of tomorrow, or from the strange feeling of being alone in a new place, or that burrito. 

Tomorrow is orientation, and I can't wait to see where I'll be working. 

Oh, and my room has a giant window overlooking the city. My nearsightedness makes the city look like silver and gold confetti. It's pleasant. 

Tomorrow the adventure begins.
