My experience living in South Central LA has been mixed. Among many things, I have returned home to:
<ul>
	<li>An old car parked in front of our house, in flames</li>
	<li>Four individuals being arrested by LAPD against our fence</li>
	<li>Homeless people looking through our trash</li>
</ul>
But, a couple of nights ago, I returned to something pretty neat: LED Streetlights. For once, thumbs up, LA!
