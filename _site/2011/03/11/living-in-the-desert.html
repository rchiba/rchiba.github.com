I read this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/garden/10texas.html">article</a> in the NYT this morning about a man who built a small house in the desert. Using increasingly affordable renewable energy, a myriad of online resources for the DIY crowd, and his fists he's slowly built a life mostly independent from the human nest we build around our daily lives.

He asks,
<blockquote>Have you ever thought to yourself, "How would I do it if I had it to do all over again?"  Usually this thought only pops into your head when you are about to die or your life is in ruin or perhaps during a midlife crisis where family and job stress suddenly takes its toll.  This feeling is usually accompanied by mounting debt and an overwhelming feeling of being trapped in the life you have chosen.  -<a href="http://thefieldlab.org/">The Field Lab Homepage</a></blockquote>
There is something about this that is so attractive. There's something about his life that I just want. Maybe independence, freedom, time. I don't know. But, now the seedling idea is planted. I want to come back to this thought someday. After financial independence.
