I read this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/garden/10texas.html">article</a> in the NYT this morning about a man who built a small house in the desert. Using increasingly affordable renewable energy, a myriad of online resources for the DIY crowd, and his fists he's slowly built a life mostly independent from the human nest we build around our daily lives.

He asks,
<blockquote>Have you ever thought to yourself, "How would I do it if I had it to do all over again?"  Usually this thought only pops into your head when you are about to die or your life is in ruin or perhaps during a midlife crisis where family and job stress suddenly takes its toll.  This feeling is usually accompanied by mounting debt and an overwhelming feeling of being trapped in the life you have chosen.  -<a href="http://thefieldlab.org/">The Field Lab Homepage</a></blockquote>
There is something about this that is so attractive. There's something about his life that I just want. Maybe independence, freedom, time. I don't know. But, now the seedling idea is planted. I want to come back to this thought someday. After financial independence.

				    <h3><a href="/2011/03/09/email-data.html">Email Data</a></h3>
				    <h4>March  9, 2011</h4>
				    <p>
				    	After getting a ton of emails yesterday, I became overwhelmed by my cluttered inbox of 1000+ read messages. I had to archive them all. There was a sigh of relief from the artificial clarity gained in having whitespace where there was once text.

I remembered the day I set up my Gmail account in 2004. Back when I emailed friends just to get them to reply so I could indulge in the pleasure of seeing unread emails in my inbox.

I decided to find out how much my inbox has changed since then.

From the daily counts, the difference is harder to see, but the monthly counts make the difference more visible.

<strong>Methodology</strong>:
1. Downloaded <a href="http://www.gmail-backup.com/" target="_blank">Gmail backup</a> and started pulling my emails down from Google. Changed my password because I read that the program phones home.

2. Wrote some simple python scripts to look for keywords and count all the numbers up.

3. Excel

				    <h3><a href="/2011/02/20/miracle-fruit.html">Miracle Fruit</a></h3>
				    <h4>February 20, 2011</h4>
				    <p>
				    	<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/files/IMGP6378.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1278 aligncenter" title="New Age Fruit Salad" src="/files/IMGP6378.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="340" /></a></p>
Miracle Fruit hit the news a couple of years ago in a <a href="http://boingboing.net/2007/02/05/miracle-fruit-alters.html" target="_blank">number</a> of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/dining/28flavor.html" target="_blank">different</a> <a href="http://www.eatfoo.com/archives/2007/02/miracle_fruit_im_a_believer.php" target="_blank">places</a>. I read about it and promptly let it exit my mind. And about a week ago, as I was daydreaming, I remembered that I have been meaning to try it. I bought a box of miracle fruit tablets from <a href="http://mberry.us/" target="_blank">the Internet</a>, and after a week of waiting, the box arrived. I then conducted my very own taste tripping experiment.

<a href="/files/IMGP6389.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1279" title="mberry Tablets" src="/files/IMGP6389.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="415" /></a>

So, a brief introduction to "miracle fruit":
<blockquote>The miracle fruit, Synsepalum dulcificum, is native to West Africa and has been known to Westerners since the 18th century. The cause of the reaction is a protein called miraculin, which binds with the taste buds and acts as a sweetness inducer when it comes in contact with acids. - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/dining/28flavor.html" target="_blank">NYT</a></blockquote>
Also interesting is miraculin's mysterious absence from America's consumer market. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculin#As_a_sweetener" target="_blank">story</a> goes that in the 1970s the FDA reclassified the protein as a food additive as it was in its final stages of development, adding years to the approval process, bankrupting the company attempting to commercializing the product, and preventing it from reaching the mass market. Some speculate sugar industry involvement. Today, miraculin is widely used in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/nov/25/japan.foodanddrink" target="_blank">Japan</a> and Europe as a diet aid and sweetener.

Anyway, after going to Ralph's and buying what must have appeared to other people as some strange New Age fruit salad, I came back and prepared to devour.

<a href="/files/IMGP6392.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1280" title="Close up fruit" src="/files/IMGP6392.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="415" /></a>

<strong>Notes on miraculin's effects on taste</strong>:

<strong>The tablet itself </strong>- It tasted like a chalky cranberry/raisin-flavored vitamin. Quickly dissolved in mouth, but the directions say to let it cover your mouth for awhile. Half a tablet was enough for me to notice extreme flavor differences for about 15 minutes, and more subtle differences for about 30 minutes after that.

<strong>Lemons </strong>- I heard the most reaction from people eating lemons from the internet, so I had high expectations. These expectations were met. Very, very sweet. Like lemon pie, or lemonade, but with the strange accompaniment of freshness you can only get by eating real fruit.

<strong>Grapefruit </strong>- The difficulty of extracting edible bits made it less satisfying than the others, but it was worth it for the juice. Next time, I'll buy a bottle of grapefruit juice instead. Tasted like grapefruit Kool-Aid with an extra cup of sugar.

<strong>Tomatoes </strong>- I ate these right after eating the lemons, and for the first couple of bites, I did not notice a difference from eating a regular tomato. However, after drinking some water and "resetting" my palate, the tomato sweetness was revealed. Concentrated mainly in the watery pulp around the seeds, the subtle sweetness resembled a watermelon that's not quite ripe. It was fun to sample, but I don't think I could eat more than one tomato like this.

<strong>Tangerine </strong>- Due to their natural sweetness, I didn't notice a difference in the tangerine I tasted that night to ripe tangerines I've had in the past. However, when I tried a tangerine from the same batch the next morning, I realized that I had been eating very new, tart tangerines.

<strong>Kiwi </strong>- Bland. The tablet may have nullified any sourness, but there was no sweetness. Ironically, it was the most expensive thing on the shopping list.

<strong>Strawberries </strong>- Imagine if polyploidy didn't plunder strawberries of their sweetness, but instead made them taste like those syrup-packed strawberries you put on fruit tarts. If miraculin were approved by the FDA, fresh strawberries would certainly become new the king of fruits.

<strong>Salt and vinegar chips</strong> - Like the tomatoes, the subtle flavor difference was only noticeable after drinking some water. Tasted like salt and vinegar and barbecue sauce chips.

<strong>Balsamic Vinegar</strong> - Tastes like Welch's grape concentrate. I could tell my digestive system was not happy after a couple of drinks of this though.

<strong>Sour cream</strong> - Very similar to yogurt: sweetness was in between plain and vanilla. Very pleasant.

<strong>Cheese (Jack)</strong> - It took a very sharp cheese and turned it mild. 

<strong>Manas Special Chicken Curry</strong> - What was originally a mildly zesty, spicy, and salty curry morphed into a much darker aroma of quietly sweet peanut sauce. Although the flavor difference was not as stark as in some of the fruits, it changed the curry entirely.

				    <h3><a href="/2011/02/15/walden-notes.html">Walden Notes</a></h3>
				    <h4>February 15, 2011</h4>
				    <p>
				    	I was skeptical for the first couple of chapters, but by the middle of the book I found again the joy in reading.

Although this can be said about any good book, I think it is worth saying that a book's true effectiveness is not in accurately describing, but in abstractly relating: Your own memories and experiences fill in the blanks between the inherent vagueness of language. And having many memories of rain, sun, and what is aptly described in Walden as "Nature", I found the book to be grossly engrossing, in a way that many things I consume can never be.

However, I didn't want to bore everybody by picking out descriptions that only I found relevant, so I collected a couple other memorable bits that Thoreau sprinkled within his description of the pond:

<strong>Thoreau's thoughts...</strong>

<strong>... on human experiences.</strong>
<blockquote>Undoubtedly, the very tedium and ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as Adam.</blockquote>
<strong>... on leisure</strong>
<blockquote>As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.</blockquote>
<strong>... on clothing</strong>
<blockquote>It is an interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if they were divested of their clothes.</blockquote>
<strong>... on materialism</strong>
<blockquote>Indeed, the more you have of such things the poorer you are. Each load looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties; and if one shanty is poor, this is a dozen times as poor.</blockquote>
<strong>... on wisdom</strong>
<blockquote>It is by a mathematical point only that we are wise, as the sailor or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his eye; but that is sufficient guidance for all our life.</blockquote>
<strong>... on philanthropy</strong>
<blockquote>There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root, and it may be that he who bestows the largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by his mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain to relieve.</blockquote>
<strong>... on prophets</strong>
<blockquote>One would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather consoled the fears than confirmed the hopes of man.</blockquote>
<strong>... on state of mind</strong>
<blockquote>I know of no more encouraging a fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do.</blockquote>
<strong>... on reddit, cnn, and huffpo</strong>
<blockquote>And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter, - we never need read of another. One is enough.</blockquote>
<strong>... on rhetoric</strong>
<blockquote>However much we may admire the orator's occasional bursts of eloquence, the noblest written words are commonly as far behind or above the fleeting spoken language as the firmament with its stars is behind the clouds. <em>There</em> are the stars, and they who may read them. The astronomers forever comment on and observe them. They are not exhalations like our daily colloquies and vaporous breath.</blockquote>
<strong>... on the passage of time</strong>
<blockquote>My days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any heathen clock; for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is said that "for yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow they have only one word, and they express the variety of meaning by pointing backward for yesterday, forward for to-morrow, and overhead for the passing day."</blockquote>
<strong>... on planet Earth</strong>
<blockquote>Men frequently say to me, "I should think you would feel lonesome down there, and want to be nearer to folks, rainy and snowy days and nights especially." I am tempted to reply as such, - This whole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space. How far apart, think you, dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder star, the breadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments?</blockquote>
<strong>... on small talk</strong>
<blockquote>Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war. We live thick and are in each other's way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another.</blockquote>
<strong>... on solitude</strong>
<blockquote>I had withdrawn so far within the great ocean of solitude, into which the rivers of society empty, that for the most part, so far as my needs were concerned, only the finest sediment was deposited around me.</blockquote>
<strong>... on the pleasure of killing weeds</strong>
<blockquote>Daily the beans saw me come to their rescue armed with a hoe, and thin the ranks of their enemies, filling up the trenches with weedy dead. Many a lusty crest-waving Hector, that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades, fell before my weapon and rolled in the dust.</blockquote>
<strong>... on virtue</strong>
<blockquote>The virtues of a superior man are like the wind; the virtues of a common man are like the grass; the grass, when the wind passes over it, bends.</blockquote>
<strong>... on modern agriculture</strong>
<blockquote>It is a vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never plucked them. The ambrosial and essential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed off in the market cart, and they become mere provender.</blockquote>
