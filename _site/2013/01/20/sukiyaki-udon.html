<p>Sukiyaki Udon is what you make if you have leftover sukiyaki and have some frozen udon in the freezer. But, it's tasty enough that it's worth skipping the first step and making mini-sukiyaki in order to make sukiyaki udon. Fantastic for cold weather and rainy days.</p>

<p><strong> Note: I usually adapt what I make using a number of recipes and taking the average, but <a href="http://www.japanfoodaddict.com/noodles/sukiyaki-beef-udon/">this recipe</a> is where I got most of it from. Also <a href="http://umamimart.com/2012/01/lazyass-cookin-nabeyaki-udon/">this nabeyaki udon blog post</a> had some nice photos I enjoyed. </strong></p>

<p>Yield: 2 Servings</p>

<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>Some thinly sliced beef (I used 1/2 lb prime chuck roll)</li>
<li>1/2 an onion (sliced)</li>
<li>green onion</li>
<li>egg</li>
<li>soy sauce</li>
<li>sake (I used white wine and it tasted fine)</li>
<li>mirin (it's a sweet alcohol used frequently to flavor Japanese broths - you could probably substitute by adding some more sugar)</li>
<li>sugar</li>
<li>broth (vegetable, chicken, beef, all work alright. You're supposed to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashi">dashi</a>, but I didn't have any sitting around)</li>
<li>(you could probably throw in some mushrooms, soft tofu,  carrots, or anything that would match a hearty udon soup)</li>
</ul>


<p>Steps</p>

<p>(Make a mini-sukiyaki to be put inside the udon)</p>

<ol>
<li>Mix 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp sake, 1 tbsp mirin, and 2 tbsp sugar together in a bowl until sugar dissolves.</li>
<li>Fry the sliced onion in a pan with some oil until semi-translucent (couple minutes)</li>
<li>Throw in meat and other veggies (mushroom, tofu) into pan and fry for a bit until semi-cooked. Then, put all of the sukiyaki liquid from step 1 into the pan and continue heating until beef is 80% cooked (do not overcook, beef can still be a bit pink). Then, turn off the heat.</li>
</ol>


<p>(Make the udon)</p>

<ol>
<li>Mix 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup broth, 3 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp mirin, 1 tbsp sake and 1 tbsp sugar in a pot and heat until pretty hot.</li>
<li>Put udon in pot, and heat until udon is fully defrosted.</li>
<li>Put the sukiyaki in the pan into the pot, also crack an egg into the soup, and stir and simmer for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Ladle into a bowl and sprinkle generously with green onions.</li>
</ol>
