Living in the city for two years makes the space required for comfort much smaller. Seeing the horizon is replaced by seeing across the street. And walking outside becomes an art in navigating man-made canyons. A shallow inset of a gigantic maze. Chaos overlapped on gridded order. And coming back to the city is always accompanied by a reassuring claustrophobia. I'm finally back in Los Angeles.

Tomorrow is the first day of class.

				    <h3><a href="/2011/01/05/compulsion-and-fun.html">Compulsion and Fun</a></h3>
				    <h4>January  5, 2011</h4>
				    <p>
				    	I read this a couple weeks ago and it changed the way I thought about games.
<blockquote>I usually distinguish between Fun and Compulsion, when talking about gameplay. World of Warcraft and other RPGs have a lot of innate Compulsion mechanisms, but usually also give you some Fun to balance it out. Most games have a mix between Fun and Compulsion, but games that keep you playing for 60 hours and have a strong collection element are usually heavy on the Compulsion side, with varying success on the Fun side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I personally think that Compulsion taps into some hardwired reptile-brain behavior in people, which came about because covering all the territory or collecting all the [valuable stuff] was beneficial to survival at some point in human history.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can usually tell if youâ€™ve been the victim of Compulsion without Fun, if you end a game much later than you intended, and promptly feel kind of stupid for not turning it off 3 hours earlier.</blockquote>
<br />
And besides video games, the power of compulsion surrounds us in everyday life: Frequent flier miles, retail rewards programs, collecting stamps. Not that it's bad or anything (Although I do admit to enjoying an <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/" target="_blank">Adbusters</a> mag every once in awhile). It's just useful to step back every once in awhile and realize that "stuff" is not likely to be what happiness is made of, whether it be virtual or otherwise.

We live on a rock in space. I like this photo because it looks almost procedurally generated. Minecraft IRL?

				    	So I finally got around to making the blog that I've always been meaning to make. Being winter break, I figured this would be a good chance. Here are some things I plan to put on here.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Interesting web links</strong>. I've been using delicious for awhile, but since it looks like they may be going away, I'll put links here. Being doubly advantageous in that more people will be able to see them, and the data is easily exportable.</li>
	<li><strong>Thoughts</strong> that at the moment seem clever, but upon future review will only trigger nostalgia for a more innocent time.</li>
	<li><strong>Photos and reflections</strong> on those photos. Sometimes there are very pretty things that I find necessary to catalog.</li>
</ul>
Maybe more.

Planning on making a static page at www.ryochiba.com for resume/project data later this week. I've had these illustrations sitting on my drive for ages, waiting to be translated onto the web.

Explanation of why the site looks like it does: I was going for something whimsical and clean. I guess it's a take on having one's head "<em>in the clouds</em>". Extra puns for the fact that this blog's purpose is to catalog things "in the cloud". Also wanted to make evening and night versions of the skin too for fun. But, maybe it's not worth it. This will do for now.
