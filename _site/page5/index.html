				    	So, a couple weeks before winter break, I put together a <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/gpsshield/" target="_blank">GPS Shield</a> for the Arduino. Below is a picture of the apparatus. Found that a tupperware works great as a container. After a few days, got it to work pretty well. It has issues in buildings, as can be seen in the map. On a side note, I also love how my entire room and desk is white. I live in a giant lightbox.

Anyway. it still boggles my mind how invisible and pervasive GPS chips are in our everyday gadgets. It takes your breath away to think about the satellites. I think this <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/ConstellationGPS.gif" target="_blank">animated gif</a> sums up the richness of it all. To think, there are thirty one silent metal machines in the frozen emptiness of space, broadcasting messages through the blue sky down to us animals. And they do it all to help us drive to Starbucks, or Grandma's, or guide missiles to a house in the desert.

So, today I went to class carrying around a little ear that can hear into the sky. Processed the data and got a map. Slowly zooming out on the map gave me some insight as to how little our day-to-day motions are on this little blue planet. Not to use our insignificance to diminish our egos, but to use it to admire the vastness of what has yet to be explored.

				    <h3><a href="/2011/01/10/asian-parenting-a-contentious-issue.html">Asian Parenting: a contentious issue</a></h3>
				    <h4>January 10, 2011</h4>
				    <p>
				    	A few days ago, I was reading <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html" target="_blank">Amy Chua</a>'s article on the WSJ about Asian parenting, I was surprised that something like this got published. But I suppose that's what it's meant to do: polarize. We feel strongly about how we were raised, but each family is different. I guess I can't say anything against the strict parenting style, as I've never been raised as such, but at the same time, I feel strongly against it. As if it threatens me, and how I was raised. Amy writes,
<blockquote>Chinese parents believe that they know what is best for their children and therefore override all of their children's own desires and preferences. That's why Chinese daughters can't have boyfriends in high school and why Chinese kids can't go to sleepaway camp. It's also why no Chinese kid would ever dare say to their mother, "I got a part in the school play! I'm Villager Number Six. I'll have to stay after school for rehearsal every day from 3:00 to 7:00, and I'll also need a ride on weekends." God help any Chinese kid who tried that one.</blockquote>
<a name="U401695346462BJ"></a>
<blockquote>Don't get me wrong: It's not that Chinese parents don't care about their children. Just the opposite. They would give up anything for their children. It's just an entirely different parenting model.</blockquote>
I also enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.jeanhsu.com/?p=229" target="_blank">Jean Hsu</a>'s response today.
<blockquote>First generation immigrants want the best for their children, as do all parents, but they really are not that qualified to judge what will lead to a successful and fulfilling life in the United States.  Their narrow-minded formula for success (great grades, ivy league, medical school, high paying job) may work for some, but it alienates those who might find success elsewhere.  Many highly successful and happy people have gotten to where they are by leaving a stable job to try to start their own company, pursuing a career in the performing arts, or majoring in something other than science, math or engineering, yet all these would be highly discouraged by most Asian parents.  When I have children of my own, I hope I will be able to stress the importance of education while they are young, but allow them the freedom to make decisions and mistakes for themselves.</blockquote>
