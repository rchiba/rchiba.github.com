				    <h3><a href="/2013/01/23/how-tint-uses-trello.html">How Tint Uses Trello</a></h3>
				    <h4>January 23, 2013</h4>
				    <p>
				    	<p>I peeked over my stand-up desk to see what Eunice, our Designer, was up to. I needed an asset for our new splash page, and I couldn't find it in our Dropbox. Each member of our small team had a different way of organizing their files, and Eunice and I had such totally different structures that I had spent the past handful of fifteen minutes trying to figure out whether it would be in the myriad of folders within Tint/splashPage1000 or Tint/design/frontPage. Total communication breakdown.</p>

<p>A couple months back, we tried using a variety of tools, including Trello, to organize our team's work and effort. With each tool, a brief spark of utility would follow, then the tool would quickly turn into a ghost town. "Tim Sae Koo updated task: Pricing Page, three weeks ago". Still getting nowhere.</p>

<p>However, we've recently made some changes to how we use Trello and it has changed our habits significantly, for the better. Note: I believe our approach is best with teams with six people or less.</p>

<p>So without further adieu, here is how we use Trello!</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hypes-images/assets/blog/2013-01-31/trello3.PNG" alt="screenshot of our trello board" /></p>

<ol>
<li>We threw out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>One of the mistakes we made when we first started using our Trello board was creating a swim lane for each stage of our product development cycle. Usually, <a href="http://www.optify.net/marketing-technology/how-optify-uses-trello-for-kanban">people recommend</a> swim lanes such as "Planning", "In Progress", "Deployment Ready", etc. The problem with this is that for a given feature, it might go back and forth between "In Progress", "Acceptance", and "On Hold" due to each task's dependence with other tasks, changes in priority, etc. When a task that is being worked on by multiple teammates goes back and forth, it becomes unclear who should move the card. Not only that, when a task is "In Progress", it is unclear who is working on it. After a week of Kanban, nobody on our team was using Trello because we had all assumed somebody else would move the card. So we abandoned the Kanban thing.</p>

<ol>
<li>No checklists</li>
</ol>


<p>Checklists are the most deceiving of all Trello features, and we used them extensively when we first failed at using Trello. The problem with checklists is that they are hidden within each card. There is no way another person on your team is going to see your checklist because it would require exploring through your cards. Yet, when using a checklist, it is easy to have the mental assumption that everyone will see it. One of my biggest mistakes was creating a card every day, and putting a checklist in it of my daily tasks. Not only was the card title completely meaningless (since it was just a date), nobody would know what I was working on! We found that checklists were totally uncollaborative and stopped using them altogether.</p>

<ol>
<li>Each swim lane is a person</li>
</ol>


<p>The success of using a project management app hinges on making sure every team member shares some of the responsibility in updating the data. Creating swim lanes for people creates clear responsibilities, and makes you feel like you are responsible for a clear portion of the board.</p>

<ol>
<li>Each card must represent an action item or user story</li>
</ol>


<p>Writing out the action in the card allows team members to quickly assess their teammate's daily and weekly priorities.</p>

<ol>
<li>Daily standups are a time to update / assess the board.</li>
</ol>


<p>Putting down blockers and tasks on the Trello board under people's names allows teammates to remember what other people said they would do, and more importantly remember what they themselves set out to do. And during the day, it becomes clearer that laying out your priorities on the board can do wonders to collaborative productivity. When interrupting someone's work, you can see what they're working on and clearly assess whether or not you should be working on the same task if they are interrelated, rather than wasting time being blocked the next day.</p>

<p>We hope that this post allows another team to achieve higher productivity with Trello, and we would love to hear about your experiences and lessons learned!</p>

				    <h3><a href="/2013/01/20/sukiyaki-udon.html">Sukiyaki Udon</a></h3>
				    <h4>January 20, 2013</h4>
				    <p>
				    	<p><img src="/images/2013-01-20-udon/udon-3.jpg" alt="Sukiyaki Udon" /></p>

<p>Sukiyaki Udon is what you make if you have leftover sukiyaki and have some frozen udon in the freezer. But, it's tasty enough that it's worth skipping the first step and making mini-sukiyaki in order to make sukiyaki udon. Fantastic for cold weather and rainy days.</p>

<p><strong> Note: I usually adapt what I make using a number of recipes and taking the average, but <a href="http://www.japanfoodaddict.com/noodles/sukiyaki-beef-udon/">this recipe</a> is where I got most of it from. Also <a href="http://umamimart.com/2012/01/lazyass-cookin-nabeyaki-udon/">this nabeyaki udon blog post</a> had some nice photos I enjoyed. </strong></p>

<p>Yield: 2 Servings</p>

<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>Some thinly sliced beef (I used 1/2 lb prime chuck roll)</li>
<li>1/2 an onion (sliced)</li>
<li>green onion</li>
<li>egg</li>
<li>soy sauce</li>
<li>sake (I used white wine and it tasted fine)</li>
<li>mirin (it's a sweet alcohol used frequently to flavor Japanese broths - you could probably substitute by adding some more sugar)</li>
<li>sugar</li>
<li>broth (vegetable, chicken, beef, all work alright. You're supposed to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashi">dashi</a>, but I didn't have any sitting around)</li>
<li>(you could probably throw in some mushrooms, soft tofu,  carrots, or anything that would match a hearty udon soup)</li>
</ul>


<p>Steps</p>

<p>(Make a mini-sukiyaki to be put inside the udon)</p>

<ol>
<li>Mix 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp sake, 1 tbsp mirin, and 2 tbsp sugar together in a bowl until sugar dissolves.</li>
<li>Fry the sliced onion in a pan with some oil until semi-translucent (couple minutes)</li>
<li>Throw in meat and other veggies (mushroom, tofu) into pan and fry for a bit until semi-cooked. Then, put all of the sukiyaki liquid from step 1 into the pan and continue heating until beef is 80% cooked (do not overcook, beef can still be a bit pink). Then, turn off the heat.</li>
</ol>


<p>(Make the udon)</p>

<ol>
<li>Mix 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup broth, 3 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp mirin, 1 tbsp sake and 1 tbsp sugar in a pot and heat until pretty hot.</li>
<li>Put udon in pot, and heat until udon is fully defrosted.</li>
<li>Put the sukiyaki in the pan into the pot, also crack an egg into the soup, and stir and simmer for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Ladle into a bowl and sprinkle generously with green onions.</li>
</ol>

				    <h3><a href="/2013/01/18/getting-started-jekyll-in-windows-with-amazon-s3.html">Getting Started With Jekyll on Windows with Amazon S3</a></h3>
				    <h4>January 18, 2013</h4>
				    <p>
				    	<p>I have created this guide in the interest of helping other people figure out how to set up Jekyll on Windows (I use Linux all day at work, but my home machine is a Windows laptop). Some of the guides out there didn't work for me since the packages they referenced were Mac-only, but hopefully this will work out for you.</p>

<h5>A brief overview of Jekyll</h5>

<p>Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby (requires no Ruby knowledge to use). Many people use it for generating their personal sites / blogs because the cost of hosting it on Amazon S3 is orders of magnitude cheaper than ordinary shared hosting, and orders of magnitude more reliable in serving the occasional high traffic spike. People also like it because there's less code between you and your writing. Since the system is just a way to convert Markdown or HTML formatted posts into a templated HTML output, it requires very little configuration and setup to get a site up and running.</p>

<p>First, get started by downloading <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">Ruby for Windows</a> along with <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">Ruby Development Kit</a>. You will also need to put the rubygems/bin folder into your PATH (<strong>Right click "Computer" -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> Edit Path variable and append the path to the bin folder</strong>).</p>

<h5>Install jekyll</h5>

<pre><code>gem install jekyll
</code></pre>

<h5>Configure and run jekyll</h5>

<p>Download some boilerplate code for your new jekyll site by cloing this convenient <a href="https://github.com/necolas/jekyll-boilerplate">jekyll boilerplate repository</a> by necolas. Then, use it to create a git repository of your own. Help in doing this can be found <a href="https://github.com/necolas/jekyll-boilerplate.git">at github</a>.</p>

<h5>Configure Amazon</h5>

<p>Log into the s3 console and create two buckets, one called <strong>yourdomain.com</strong> and another called <strong>www.yourdomain.com</strong>. In the properties of the <strong>www.yourdomain.com</strong>* bucket, go to "Static Website Hosting" and select "Enable website hosting". Then for the index document use "index.html" and for th error document use "error.html". You can create error.html later as it's not part of the boilerplate code. Then, configure the <strong>yourdomain.com</strong> bucket by editing its properties in the same way, except select "Redirect all requests to another host name", and redirect all the requests to <strong>www.yourdomain.com</strong>.</p>

<h5>Setup your DNS</h5>

<p>Go to your DNS settings and for your zone apex record (Usually donated with an <em>@</em>, it represents the record that is used when a user types in "yourdomain.com"), have it set to URL Redirect to "www.yourdomain.com" and for the <em>www</em> record, have it point to the endpoint of your "www.yourdomain.com" record, which you can find in its properties under "Static Website Hosting"</p>

<h5>Setup the s3 interface</h5>

<p>Next, you'll set up an easy way to push your new site to s3. Then, download an s3 interface for the Windows command line. (I use this instead of the jekyll-s3 package recommended on the main Jekyll repository because for some reason jekyll-s3 would not upload my images correctly to s3)</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.codeplex.com/">s3.exe for Windows</a></p>

<p>Lastly, cd to the directory your jekyll blog is at and use the following command in your command line:</p>

<pre><code>s3 put www.bucketname.com _site/ /sub:withdelete /sync /acl:public-read
</code></pre>

<p>This command uploads your the <strong>_site</strong> folder to your <strong>bucketname.com</strong> bucket, deleting files on s3 that don't exist anymore locally, only uploading files that have changed since last upload, and making all the files on s3 public.</p>

<p>For your convenience, you can put these commands as a batch file you can run when you want to update your site. Simply create a file in your blog folder called update_blog.bat and add the following text to it:</p>

<pre><code>cd C:\Put\the\path\to\your\blog\here
jekyll --no-auto --no-server
git commit -am "updating blog"
git push origin master
s3 put www.yourdomain.com _site/ /sub:withdelete /sync /acl:public-read
</code></pre>

<p>All that's needed to do now is to edit the templates and posts in a similar fashion to the boilerplate, and run the batch script.</p>

				    <h4>January 16, 2013</h4>
				    <p>
				    	<p><a href="http://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,188352,188430#msg-188430">Nginx 502's - random form</a>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11526674/nginx-big-header-response">Nginx big header response - stackoverflow</a></p>

<p>Just spent the last couple hours on this bug where Tint was returning 502's when users try to add twitter accoutns. It turns out that Nginx has difficulty handling requests with large headers. Passing twitter id's using cookie-based sessions was enough to result in mysterious 502's.</p>

<p>Solution:
Put the following in the nginx.conf</p>

<pre><code>proxy_buffer_size 128k;
proxy_buffers 4 256k;
proxy_busy_buffers_size 256k;
fastcgi_buffers 8 16k;
fastcgi_buffer_size 32k;
</code></pre>

<p>In other news, today we launched lakersnation.com, and here is a graph of servers undergoing some load.</p>
