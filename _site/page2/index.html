				    <h4>January 15, 2013</h4>

				    	<p><a href="http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-to-write-opening-sentence.html">How to write an opening sentence - by Kaz Thomas</a></p>

<p>Not long ago, I found a blog post with practical advice on writing an opening sentence. When it comes to writing, putting down the opening sentence is one of my biggest challenges (Not finding ideas to write about, which I have too many of and are sometimes totally uninteresting or absurd!). IMHO, the first sentence is key in effective writing and the best openers are bipolar in nature: Fluidly transparent, yet fetching. It catches your attention, but allows the story to grip you, but without shifting your mind too far.</p>

<p>In the post mentioned at the top, the author brings in some patterns he's observed in other writer's first sentences, and I thought I would share a selection of interesting first sentences from my kindle's recently read. Maybe I'll find something interesting.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Tonight we're going to show you eight silent ways to kill a man." - Forever War by Joe Haldeman</p>

<p>"Beyond the Indian hamlet, upon a forlorn strand, I happened on a trail of recent footprints" - Cloud Atlas by David Stephen Mitchell</p>

<p>"The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He's got esprit up to here." - Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson</p>

<p>"In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul." - Dune by Frank Herbert</p>

<p>"Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta." - Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov</p>

<p>"Mother died today." - The Stranger by Albert Camus</p></blockquote>

<p>For me, the most interesting part of each of these first sentences is how quickly they convey the voice of the author throughout the rest of the novel. In the same way one instantly recognizes a face at a glance, the pattern of letters brings to life the entire book that lies ahead. Collecting these sentences has reminded me why I enjoy each of these books.</p>

<p>The conclusion to this is that every first sentence that you write down should be seen as a representation of yourself, your voice, and should plant yourself in a distinct direction. I just can't imagine any of the books above having a flimsy entrance like "Not long ago" or "Most people...".</p>

<p>Ah, and if you're interested in the tips mentioned in the linked blog post, here they are as written by Kaz Thomas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply tell the reader what the subject is.</li>
<li>Make a blunt statement.</li>
<li>Cite a statistic.</li>
<li>Tell a first-person anecdote that's relevant to the subject.</li>
<li>Tell a third-person anecdote.</li>
<li>Put up a straw man, then knock it down.</li>
<li>Summarize a current state of affairs (or the conventional wisdom), then tell what's changed.</li>
<li>Summarize previous research, then tell what new research has found.</li>
<li>Involve the reader in a bit of conjecture.</li>
<li>Start with a quotation from a famous figure. (But beware of triteness.)</li>
<li>Commit an egregious exaggeration. Then explain what the (less extreme) reality is.</li>
</ul>

				    <h4>July  7, 2012</h4>
				    <p>
				    	<img class="alignnone" title="Cat in Amazon Box" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3512/3847864550_b5f8fcc789_z.jpg" alt="Cat in Amazon Box" width="640" height="408" />

<p>Audience: Novices who have no experience/knowledge of web development, who have never hosted a website themselves, but want to host a static website.</p>

<h2>Amazon, isn’t that the site I buy shoes off of?</h2>
<p>Most people know Amazon only as a big online department store, or even digital bookstore, but in 2002, they created a new department within their organization called Amazon Web Services (or AWS). This department provides a myriad of services to anyone needing processing, storing, sending, and hosting data. For example, one service, called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), lets you borrow a computer (that you connect and control through the internet) and use it for (mostly) anything you want. The “Cloud” in EC2 is the buzzword that you might have heard on the news. Amazon’s Web Services are all “in the cloud” because they present a simplified interface to interact with their enormously complex network of computers. Whereas in the past, increasing your computer’s speed by tenfold meant buying ten computers, hooking them up, and writing software to allow them all to share their resources, using Amazon, all you have to do is drag a slider. This saves lots of time and headache for people and so everyone seems to have gone bananas over the concept recently.</p>

<h2>I thought we were talking about S3, not EC2.</h2>
<p>Ah yes, so today we will use another service, Simple Storage Service (S3). This service lets you store files on an Amazon computer. These files can be then accessed by anyone connected to the Internet. This is handy because I just described a website.</p>

<h2>How much does Amazon cost?</h2>
<p>Amazon provides a <a href="http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html">calculator</a> to figure this out. New users get a discount for a year, and Amazon charges you based on how much you use their service (which depends on how many files you store and how much traffic your site gets). I used the calculator, and assuming you store 1GB or less of stuff, and have 5000 visitors a month (which would be a likely scenario for a personal site), it’ll be free for the first year and 14 cents a month after that. Amazon can change their pricing at will, but in any case, the cost should be marginal.</p>

<h2>Why use Amazon?</h2>
<p>
There are many companies have similar web services to Amazon. Microsoft has <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure</a>. Google has <a href="http://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform </a>. They all are competitors with similar services and pricing schemes. I simply chose Amazon because more people use them at the moment.</p>

Note: There are also a plethora of smaller companies that let you “borrow” computers to use as a web server (which is what these Internet-connected file-serving computers are called). Some examples include GoDaddy, Dreamhost, and Hostgator. In contrast to Amazon, these companies are not “cloud computing” services, but are regular web hosting companies. What that means to you is that they charge fixed rates per-month (instead of dynamically varying the pricing depending on your usage of the service). This means that it is usually cheaper to use Amazon.

<h2>Lets do it.</h2>
Grab all the files you want to host and put them in a folder somewhere easy to get to, like the desktop.

Create a new account on AWS. (You will need to provide a credit card)

Go to your AWS batcave, ahem, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home">management console</a>.
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Rw_tLKSlkpPsRHEuf4eBd_N0EbpcZO2fTI5TCDwZtujpADRyFttGPayPT1QgEHXxmjTz80mjrKxuamccljXE3uyg1KoSQffZFvotClkgNaxi-L6RNzs" alt="" width="640px;" height="60px;" />
(And you were wondering why each service had an abbreviation...)

Open the S3 tab in the management console, click “Create Bucket”. Name it “ryochiba-personalSite” or another title that describes your site. Note that the name of the bucket must be unique across all of the buckets hosted on Amazon, so prefix the bucket name with your name or something unique to make sure. Also, for the name:
<ul>
	<li>Should not contain uppercase characters</li>
	<li>Should not contain underscores (_)</li>
	<li>Should be between 3 and 63 characters long</li>
	<li>Should not end with a dash</li>
	<li>Cannot contain two, adjacent periods</li>
	<li>Cannot contain dashes next to periods (e.g., "my-.bucket.com" and "my.-bucket" are invalid)</li>
</ul>

The region specifies where the server will be located. If you live in ‘merica, US Standard should be fine. Click “Create”.
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mNEf25aiOn2Q8mMvJAAM_fzFefb9timMxJ20sLB4CZGUHk5xKazXFklktMjnjkViDdVFb2jarkOYtxfHReHXMbFcIpEFBvSRYngmIO-aTPiw9V02Qw" alt="" width="316px;" height="419px;" />


Now, upload the files you want as part of your website.<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pzbmkD0Wd64pBHoeRsw51HEaGik4wte7WjQllbv7Rhv9_tSmhfV2NFqaUoZoHG7R9dLQX0GyPWCo04dSVEhJc5GBcSplSFQS3jqiyCNzlTDs00RPcD8" alt="" width="518px;" height="251px;" />

Right click on the bucket and click “properties”<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u0TOOILU8SXDSsweR9NHNqyBXnqKAiMKEhEG6sA3iCCR0o0W1tophFXm4DPP9gojcACoTF00H2CErkkXhVMkWcQjF7qjhMqa4zDT4PflRyGxOs4qwv8" alt="" width="377px;" height="277px;" />

Now the properties for this bucket should show up at the bottom of the screen. Now we will allow anyone on the Internet to access our bucket. On the “Permissions” tab, click “Edit bucket policy”. In the text box, paste in the rule below, changing “example-bucket” to the name of your bucket. Then hit “Save”.
{
"Version":"2008-10-17",
"Statement":[{
"Sid":"PublicReadForGetBucketObjects",
"Effect":"Allow",
"Principal": {
"AWS": "*"
},
"Action":["s3:GetObject"],
"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
]
}
]
}

Next, click on the “Website” tab and check “Enabled”. In the “Index Document” field, enter the name of the file that is your site’s index document. This file will be returned by the server when people access the “root” of your website. (if my site was <a href="about:blank">www.ryochiba.com,</a> it would be the file that gets returned when you type in ryochiba.com into the browser).
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hTw6S_Uv-RUHGpcVDbklwsKSzcEUYIII4t0wL8PextZSDMmqSG7pXwOlfL3dzQVNzSN0obQ9EcbTYwc6fB4T2_BXRiSfqq6fSc_r_MeRwcAqUaW-fAk" alt="" width="800px;" height="256px;" />

Then, try going to the url in the Endpoint. Your file should be appear!

Hey! I want my URL to be the domain name I bought!

Now, log into the site that you bought your domain name from, and add a new CNAME entry in the DNS records whose value is the Endpoint url. It should take a couple of minutes to a few hours to have the changes be saved, so be patient.

<ul>
	<li>People are more similar than different.</li>

Folsom St. was steep, but I made it to my new temporary pad. 

Feeling a little lonely. For the first time in awhile. Reminds me of my first night at USC. But so far, everything has been positive. The people in my new apartment are friendly, there's a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryochiba/5724943799/in/photostream" target="_blank">wonderful hill/park</a> in the backyard, and I ate a real burrito for lunch today. I can't tell if the knot in my gut is from the nervous anticipation of tomorrow, or from the strange feeling of being alone in a new place, or that burrito. 

Tomorrow is orientation, and I can't wait to see where I'll be working. 

Oh, and my room has a giant window overlooking the city. My nearsightedness makes the city look like silver and gold confetti. It's pleasant. 

Tomorrow the adventure begins.

The idea came from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Salmon-with-Lentils-and-Mustard-Herb-Butter-em-Saumon-aux-Lentilles-em-241768">this page</a>. Turned out fine, a little overcooked. I'm surprised at how enjoyable the lentils were though. As a side note, does anyone else enjoy reading the Wikipedia articles on the ingredients they're using while they're waiting on things to cook? That has to be part of my top five use cases for my iPod (among other things: remembering office hours, reading HN, and playing Katamari). Interesting tidbit: Lentils and rice make a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_protein">complete protein</a> dish.
