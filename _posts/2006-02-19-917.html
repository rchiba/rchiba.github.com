I had a little bit of spare time this afternoon, so I spent the 70% of the time modelling random things that I pull up from www.imageafter.com and spent 30% of the time re-reading my favorite webcomics.<br /><br />Re-reading the webcomics really felt like re-entering a comfy, old dream. An ethereal world that disappeared for a few months because of my lack of time. With the bulk of robotics build season winding down, I think I'll spend my newly founded time engaging myself in my old hobby of drawing. As I've found out this afternoon, my drawing skills are surprisingly at the same level as before. That isn't saying much though, I'm a rather poor artist (if I can even call myself that), poor meaning poor in skill. But, I realized that getting into 2d art before 3d CG art really helped accelerate my love and familiarization of both. The best part is that both involve the computer in one way or another. There is a strong connection between 2d and 3d creation skill. It's all about visualization.<br /><br />But, isn't everything?
