<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Where have I been? Happy? Sad? In love? Reading, hearing, and thinking about comments that personal blogs are horrible wretches of muck? Yes. That's where I've been. <br /></br><br /></br>A six day weekend follows an exciting blizzard. It's a coat of white. It penetrates all. Out of the window, your eyes wander. And then, <i>bam!</i> The whiteness of the earth is a poignant reminder of the weakness of ourselves to the faceless entity of nature. We are nearing the end of this lazy span of time. <br /></br><br /></br>Lazy... Although this giant snow day has been relaxing, it's easy to lose track of time and piddle it away doing mindless things. A world without deadlines. A nirvana? No, something less ideal. So, here I go, listing what I've accomplished, trying to justify my heavy piddling.<br /></br><br /></br><br /></br><big><b>List of 2007 Snow Day Week Accomplishments</b>:</big><br /></br><br /></br><br /></br><font color='#000000'><a href='http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome'><img width='255' height='42' border='0' src='http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/webservices/mechanical-turk/logoAI3.gif' alt='Mechanical Turk' class='logo'></img></a></font><br /></br><a href='http://www.mturk.com/'>[LINK]</a> I did a little bit of the mTurk thing. Nabbed $1.70. For an hour of work. Minimum wage is for losers.<br /></br><h2><img width='252' height='55' src='http://www.mozilla.com/img/firefox-title.png' alt='Firefox 2'></img></h2>Downloaded Firefox 2 <a href='http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/'>[LINK]</a> and a number of Firefox plugins. It's been out for ages, and I felt guilty for not touching it. I'm ditching Opera for the moment because it crashes on my computer. Plus, installing <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/39/'>mouse gestures</a> on Firefox replaces most of why I used Opera in the past. Call me a traitor.<br /></br><br /></br><br /></br><img width='395' height='144' src='http://www.harrisonboilerrobotics.org/images/aboutus/banner.png' alt='1747 isn't just a number'></img><br /></br>Worked on the robotics team website <a href='http://www.harrisonboilerrobotics.org/index.htm'>[LINK]</a> with Chris. It's not that great. It's been hard work to get it to where it's at, really. Chris and I are probably the most on task people on the team. The problem with the website is that there isn't any content for it. No interesting links, no team picture, no exciting stories, no nothing. Tomorrow is the open house and I don't think they'll be very impressed with the website. Also, it is powerfully depressing to think about how <i>few</i> people will actually visit the website and use it. The rest of the team doesn't seem very appreciative either. Oh well. It's the learning experience, eh? On a positive note, the animation was uploaded in a timely manner. <br /></br><br /></br>I had to fudge a bit when I had to come up with the "written consent" for the music I used. Completely justified fudging though. The music I used is under a Creative Commons Public Domain license, so I have the rights to use it in the animation. I'd say that's pretty legit "written consent", don't you think?<br /></br><br /></br><font face='Verdana'><img width='210' height='182' border='0' src='http://www.origami-instructions.com/images/lily/thumbnails/21-origami-lily.jpg' alt='completed origami lily'></img>  </font><img width='165' height='220' alt='http://image.misterart.com/grouppix/528x352/000/g396.jpg' src='http://image.misterart.com/grouppix/528x352/000/g396.jpg'></img><br /></br><font face='Verdana'>Made a valentines present for Tif using origami paper and chocolate. I like the final product, and hope that she likes it as well. On the receiving end of things, I got a sketchbook and a pack of drawing pencils. I've been secretly wanting a new sketchbook, especially after the water damage on my old one (caused by a rainy summer day). She's <i>sharp</i>.<br /></br><br /></br><br /></br></font><img width='418' height='75' src='http://www2.blogger.com/img/blogger_buzz.gif' alt='Blogger Buzz'></img><font face='Verdana'><br /></br><br /></br>Updated this blog.
