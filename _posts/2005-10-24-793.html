The tension is mounted, and all I need is a trigger.<br /><br />A trigger to set me off on some sort of wild rampage. I don't know what kind of rampage it would be. I suppose if I was to not deviate from the stereotypical rampage, I would have to bring a firearm to school, kill many innocent people, hold a few of them hostage, and in the end, kill myself. But, of course, I'm not much of a social conformist. <br /><br />My kind of rampage would probably involve playing Super Smash Brothers Melee for hours on end, not stopping for food or water. I would probably end up dead on the floor, eyes twitching from the television, hands still clutching the controller. I would be a cold, dead body. But, a cold, dead SSBM master, no?<br /><br />Well, another rampage I suppose would be possible would be a French and Chemistry paranoia rampage. In this rampage, I would mindlessly scream expletives while intensely studying either French or Chemistry. Or both. Also in this rampage, I would end up dead in the end, most likely from exhaustion or dehydration.<br /><br />Yet another rampage would be a rampage involving a hunger strike/homework binge. In this sort of rampage, I would lock my door, refuse to eat, and do the whole year's homework. Every night would be a long one, with me shaking from the stress, under the spell of insanity and homework-induced crazyness. Again, I would probably find a way to kill myself with my usb network adapter and a cheap roll of tape.<br /><br />And, now, it's time for my prophecy of tomorrow.<br /><br />I predict that tomorrow will be hellishly full of homework and extracurricular activities. My life will suck like no other, and I will be the quintessence of raving lunatic. <br /><br />You can tell how optimistic I am, can't you?
