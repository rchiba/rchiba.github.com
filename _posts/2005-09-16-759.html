The Internet is like Chicago. <br /><br />A few ritzy buildings and acres of slums. <br /><br />There are many sites out there that contribute to Internet rubbish, of them being personal blogs, like this one. I suppose calling this blog rubbish would be a mistake. I suppose this blog stands out. I suppose it's the exception. Perhaps it's not.<br /><br />What is for sure though, is that there are plenty of Xangas, LiveJournals, and Blogs that are just plain pointless. Of them being the blogs of my peers. Often, they write of their lives in plain, bland language. The events of their lives, being explained in an unexciting and impersonal tone. I hate sites like this, especially since there's no point to them. There is no purpose in a journal if there is not a message, or lesson to share about it. Your whole day might as well not exist if you didn't learn something from it. That's why it's incredibly stupid to start a journal if you do not have the capacity to analyze the events of the day and learn from them. Not a single person cares about what you did, after all, the world doesn't revolve around you. But, what readers can relate about are messages and lessons. Perhaps an opinion or two could spice it up. People aren't going to read your bland life log if it doesn't have pizzazz.<br /><br />But, pizzazz is quite a problem in itself. I see so many sites that have flashy buttons, stupid cursors, irrationally bright backgrounds, insane fonts, pointless little songs, and other nonsense graphics and sound that pop up in one form or another while I browse my peers' journals. I find it disgusting that people try to get people to care about them by bombarding them with idiotic nonsense like this. Cosmetic things are worthless when compared to your writing. People don't buy books to stare at the cover. But even without reading my rant, isn't it obvious that white text over a bright pink background is a definite mistake? Yet, the world keeps turning, and stupid teenagers around the world are polluting the Internet with graphic garbage. <br /><br />I believe in Internet Ecology. Do your part to clean the environment, whether analog or digital.
