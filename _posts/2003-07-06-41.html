Hello hello hello.
<br />I got the juciest grossest news. Ill tell u guys at the end. For now, I've got other things to say. It is stormy right now and as i type this i hear many a thunder. I am fearing that the power will be cut. It is very dark and the creeks are flooded. The water almost came to the top of the bridge. Many houses flooded and probably many more that will be.
<br />Anyways... here is the juicy gossip going around east tipp students right now. Keep reading at ur own risk
<br />***GROSS GOSSIP***MAYBE NOT TRUE***
<br />Ok, here it goes. I was talking to Kyle on the telephone just a second ago. He was telling me about when to get together and stuff when the abnormal topic of Birds and Bees sprung up. It seems that a certain girl named Ali and a boy named Nathan got together at night somewhere. And you know the rest... They had...Sex. Ya thats what I heard from Kyle. Kyle said he heard it from Tony. Also, another certain someone arised to the situation. Ill tell later cuz i gotta go to the gym right now, bye..
