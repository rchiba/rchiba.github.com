Roller Coaster Tycoon has some serious drawbacks.
<br />
<br />One of them is that it is extremely ADDICTIVE. It has been hampering my blog progress. I mean, you cannot resist playing it. It's crazy.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have a cold and it is bothering me to the point that I have a immense frustration. I've heard from Janet that there is a Klu Klux Klan meeting in Lafayette during the spring. They kill blacks, terrorize people, chant, etc. At least that's what Janet said. Ryan says that there was one isolated meeting 5 years ago when one guy pulled out a gun and shot some black dude. Now, who do I believe? Anyways, I found out that my laptop is actually capable of something. I can Word Process on it and play SNES games. I have found a good use for it, hoorah! Anyways, not much is going on for me, on this balmy labor day weekend. Boring. I turned down my invitation with Ryan to go to Purdue with him this afternoon because I am sick. I think that's proving to be a very bad choice. Zut alor!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I'm feeling like uploading photos so I probably will.
<br />
<br />Later Homies! (me trying to be cool)
