I discovered that my hardcore SSBM gaming skills were no match for four handicap points and a witty blonde girl.<br /><br />I had an intense gaming session with Rachel an hour or so ago. I haven't had a gaming session as engaging as that since... Well, since never. I went nuts and started going all "Beavis & Butthead" on everyone. It's pretty stupid, the stuff I can say when I'm screaming at the TV and laughing at how I said "lug nut", or something of that nature. My hands, face, and arms were numb after the hour long match. It was grueling work. It was a tie 'till the very end. The last kill went to Rachel though. Yes, I lost. Sadly, my mad asian gamer skills failed me.<br /><br />I will sulk in shame now.
