La de da... La de da... <br /><br />That "Beatles" music is getting to my head.<br /><br />A study session for tomorrow's French exam is going very well. Except for the fact that French is actually a black death spiral of doom. I don't know what to say, but needless to say, I'm expecting a low B.<br /><br />Also, tommorow is the day of the event in my calendar called "the little diving/swimming get together thingie (Warning!1!)". I'm supposed to bring an entree, but I'm too lazy, and Rachel told me not to. I know I'll look like a mooch, but what the hey. I don't care about athletics. I shun athletics.<br /><br />Tommorow (I'm losing my spelling ability) is a work day. Shoot.
