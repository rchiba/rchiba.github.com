I've been researching about the "browser wars". 
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />There seems to have been 2 wars, one between Netscape and Internet Explorer, and one that is taking place now between Mozilla, Internet Explorer, and Opera. In the first war, IE conquered all. The second war is still on the edge of a knife. I use opera. IE definitely should go down, but alas, Microsoft has IE pre-installed on 90% of all computers in the world. If you don't know what a browser is, you seriously need to get out more. A browser is a program you use to "browse" the internet. 
<br />
<br />On the topic of browsers, I can't get Ryan to stop using IE. It's so frustrating. Oh well, it's not my computer. I still angers me that he has to use it though. Grr...
<br />
<br />On the topic of Ryan, he has been on a new diet. It's called the chocolate syrup with nuts diet. You put a bunch of chocolate syrup and nuts on a plate, freeze it, and eat it. Very entertainingly shocking. I thought he liked cooking. I mean, pop-tarts and corn dogs are BAD, but chocolate syrup and nuts? That's a bit too far Ryan. I still think it's a bit odd though. I couldn't stand eating that much sugar. I absolutely hate everyone's notion that they won't get fat. It won't happen to you, right? You're invincible. Just tell that to 1/3 of the adults in the United States of America who are overweight or obese. Were they invincible? Invincible from anorexia, ha.
