Oh, woe is me!<br /><br />My notebook has been left at the lunch table and I assume that it's been KIA (Killed In Action) so I've given up hope on it. Good thing that my sister is obsessed with art and whatnot. I'm sure I can steal some supplies from her without alerting anyone.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm wondering if anyone has that notebook right now. If I found a notebook like mine, then I would consider it a VALUABLE find since I had so much in it. I had endless rants that made no sense, crappy sketches, and lots of ink. I'm now sure that you would get a lot of revenue from selling this thing, but hey.<br /><br />Quizbowl for the next 4 days, w00T.<br /><br />And, for the record, I still feel like a flogged moose tied to a large wooden object.
