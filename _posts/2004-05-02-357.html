The band trip was a sucess, but the garage sale wasn't.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />It's late sunday night now and here I am updating. Steven Devine was expelled for having drugs in his locker. Fifth one this week. Seems so common now, signs I tell you! Anyways, the band trip? The grueling 7 hour journey was worthwhile. I mean, I  got to spend the night in a hotel with HBO! Anyways, That was fun and all, but I have created another movie. It's going to be a series. It's called "Banana Man". My associate Devin and I created a nice 4.5 minute movie. It's great. I'm thinking of making a company website about my production company of 2.5 people and freebie software. My company is "Kow Studios". Nice name for a cheap company. It's the first good movie. Devin is a good actor. I have to go because it is getting late and I have a science test tomorow. I have to put in on my schedule to make a "Kow Studios" website.
