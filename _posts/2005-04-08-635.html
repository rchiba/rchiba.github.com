I was never really much of a networker.<br /><br />I urge myself to take initiative to get people to invite me to places (Which usually involves me making myself seem like a tag-along moocher, but that's besides the point), but I never go. Andrew and Rachel really had me into going to the "Live from Graff" concert, but I never went. I'm not going to make up some silly excuse like I often do. I just don't enjoy thinking about socializing with other people. I relatively enjoy actually doing it, but terrible memories of previous social experiences have caused me to shun myself from the such. I have memories where I have just faded into a corner, no one really trying to integrate me. It was usually me and my camera, or me and my book, or me and my watch... Just looking at everyone having fun. I just sit there, trying to imagine my purpose in all of this. I don't seem to fit in in these memories. It scares me, and makes me sad when I think about it. I suppose that's why I didn't go to "Live from Graff" or other social occasions that I have previously missed. I'm a bit shy. Well, shy wouldn't be the word. I can talk to people fine, but when there's competition with others, it gets to be hectic and I lose hope. The best word to use would be... Hopeless...
