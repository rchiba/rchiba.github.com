Um, I'd thought I'd update you guys (if you're reading -_-) Um, well, let's see here. Today was quite stressful, but I don't mind that much, I'm used to it. I'm going to be revamping my own site, might put my novel up on there... Um. I'm not sure what to say except....
<br />RESPECT RESPECT RESPECT! R-E-S-P-E-C-T!!!!!!!!!!!
<br />Sorry, had to say that because I just can't get anyone to respect my personal space, my bubble, my only sanctuary! 
<br />Fun Fact of the Day: Amanda does NOT like skin-skin contact. She likes you far away from her. She is not afraid to hit, kick, or do anything within her power to get you outside of her boundary. You come close and you die. Die! You hear me????!!!! DIIIIIIEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!
<br />*sigh* o.k., my rant is over. 
<br />Sorry. See? stressful!
<br />Day+lack of sleep+ too much pushing on nerves --------->equals a stressed out Amanda which in turn = an unhappy Amanda which then equals total system meltdown and global destruction. 
<br />There, some math for y'all ^_______^ <---- see, i should be doing with all day, not this; >.<
<br />O.k., um, agenda thing... help Brandi make a site. There, Happy is me.
<br />Not.
<br />Ha.
<br />Had ya going didn't i blog-thing? DIDN'T I!!!???
<br />O.k., enough caffeine for me, see ya!
<br />~Amanda
