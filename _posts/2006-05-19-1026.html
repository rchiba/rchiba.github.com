My sleep schedule is still geared toward Robotics season.<br /><br />The very fabric of my consciousness is being cut and tailored to something that no longer exists. I've tried changing my alarms, keeping myself up to adjust against my biological clock. But, I'm still consistently falling asleep during Health class, even though I have no need to engage in microsleep. I'm still taking a nap in the early afternoon, even though I don't stay after school until 9pm anymore. I still stay up until the wee hours of the morning, even though I don't have any newsletters to make, or research to do.<br /><br />It's frustrating. I just woke up, and my mind is a mess of groggy slush.<br /><br />Just now, I noticed A few books in my desk shelf that I don't remember being there before. From this evidence, I can glean that someone has been in my room. I sit in front of the same desk day after day, and so I notice even the slightest differences or changes that occur if one crosses the border into my room and moves things. This suspiscion coincides with the loss of an important math notebook and an English textbook. Call me paranoid, but my room is different.<br /><br />One of the books that I found on my shelf to be different is <i>The Last Battle</i>, by C.S. Lewis, from <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>. I remember getting this book in 1st grade, and for some reason, trying to read it. Every day, I would read it, but wouldn't understand it. I read the words, but the story didn't get through. Nonetheless, I touted to all of my friends that I had read it. One possible reason for reading it was that I was a selfish and egotistical brat that read it for the sake of impressing others. That's very possible. But, whatever the case, the first paragraph of the book is worth noting. It goes something like this:<br /><br />"<i>In the last days of Narnia, far up to the west beyound Lantern Waste and close beside the great waterfall, there lived an Ape. He was so old that no one could remember when he had first come to live in those parts, and he was the cleverest, ugliest, and most wrinnkled Ape you can imagine. He had a little house, built of wood and thatched with leaves, up in the fork of a great tree, and his name was Shift. There were ver few Talking Beasts, or men or Dwarfs, or people of any sort, in that part of the wood, but Shift had one friend and negihbor who was a donkey called Puzzle. <br /><br />At least <b>they both said they were friends,</b> but from the way things went on you might have thought Puzzle was more like Shift's servant than his friend. He did all the work. When they went together to the river, Shift filled the big skin bottles with water but it was Puzzle who carried them back. When they wanted anything from the towns further down the river it was Puzzle who went down with empty panniers on his back and came back with the panniers full and heavy. <b>And all the nicest things that Puzzle bright back were eaten by Shift;</b> for as Shift said, "You see, Puzzle, I can't eat grass and thistles like you, so it's only fair I should make it up in other ways." And Puzzle always said, "Of course, Shift, of course. I see that." <br /><br />Puzzle never complained, <b>because he knew that Shift was far cleverer than himself </b>and he thought it was very kind of Shift to be friends with him at all. And if ever Puzzle did try to argue about anything, Shift would always say, "Now, Puzzle, I understand what needs to be done <b>better than you</b>. You know you're not clever, Puzzle." And Puzzle always said, "No, Shift. It's quite true.<b> I'm not clever.</b></i>"<br /><br />That simple passage was so powerful to me because I can see its relation to my own life. There are times when I feel as manipulative as Shift, and there are times when I feel as used as Puzzle. Feeling like either creates conflict with myself. When I am used, I feel powerless, but when I manipulate others, I feel evil. It's very hard to ever strike a balance and finally feel positive. <br /><br />Everyday things like a page from a random book on my desk, or a few lines sung by a random artist on the radio, are what I enjoy thinking about. I say that I'm isolated, but I'm not. I'm connected to the world, just as the world is connected to me. Life's one giant mesh of communication and thought. I should realize this and relax, because as the Postman says, "Things are getting better every day". <br /><br />My life is no different.<br /><br />Sometimes, I want to hit myself for not realizing this. <br /><br />Sometimes, I think I'm the same egotistical punk I was a decade ago.<br />
