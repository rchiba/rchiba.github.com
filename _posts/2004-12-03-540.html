I've been working on my homework nonstop for the past few hours and I still have hours more ahead of me. I can't help but feel overy jealous of my classmates. I feel the envy. They, at study hall, can talk. Have the life. Have the time. Time, such a zealously precious word. I don't have time. Time to be happy. Do you need time to be happy? I think so, because I'm not happy and I don't have time. Don't you see a correlation? I feel terrible. Like an overworked ox, ready to die. Die for the sake of relief. But relief can't be felt unless you're alive. Catch-22 my friend, catch-22. I don't even know what it means.
<br />
<br />Everyone at school seems to be happy. They talk. They talk about things too trivial for real discussion. Talk about nonsense, inefficient talking. Talking that has no purpose. Going on and on. I suppose they do this to occupy their time. The time that they have and I don't. Why do they occupy their precious time with trivial matters? Why are they so carefree and happy? Why am I not?
<br />
<br />With two journalism articles ahead of me, I'll probably be up until 10 p.m. or so. They I wake up tomorow at 6 a.m. to go to school to compete in Quizbowl. My weekend is nonexistant. My classmates have so much time. I want to grab it away. Take it in. They have the weekend. A luxurious weekend of doing nothing. I have a weekend filled with stress and work. That isn't even a weekend. It's like the week never ends. It's like it never ended. The envy is turning to anger and rage. They don't deserve the precious time, I loath it. Why do they keep it all to themselves? Why me? I ask all of these questions and they will never be answered to me. Why?
<br />
<br />I'm so frustrated. Where is my life? I want it back.
