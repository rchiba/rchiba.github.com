Ryo, sorry I took the link down on my other page. I am just not ready yet, not ready for others to know. I don't want sympathy or anything, I don't want people to know and look at me weird. All I want is to be normal again, please understand. But yes, everything I've told you is true, and I hate every part of it.
<br />So tomorrow, a part of me will die again. 
<br />I know, I shouldn't dwell on it, but it is rare for me to be scared, and right now is one of those times. For I face my pain face to face, and part of me dies. I am afraid when I shouldn't be. 
<br />There is no justice and no one to save my soul. 
<br />~Amanda
