Today was just another day that has passed me by. In math, everyone went insane about the math final. People were crying and whatnot. I don't understand what was so important. Practically everyone got an A and I got an A+!
<br />It was a simple test with not many hard questions. Anyways, alot of people got good grades. Also, alot of people were complaining about how they were going to fail.
<br />
<br />Today in social studies (history), we watched one of those kindergarten "School House Rock" movies. I can't believe they show us those stupid, stereotypical movies in such a high grade. I watched those movies BEFORE I was in preschool! They don't show the truth and it seems like the government injected it with SUPERPROPAGANDA horomones. It's very propagandaish. It had applauding people, associating positive stimuli with Red, White, and Blue. It also talked about how America was the best and it's "melting pot" example was positively irrelevant! I can't believe that I had to waste part of my life watching that video. It is a saddening disgrace to see 8th graders watching a cartoonish movie made in the 70's with corny tunes.
<br />
<br />Anyways, everyone is so obsessed with "Lord of The Rings". You can tell it is a fad that no one will remember in 5 years. But, of course, it is too big of a part of peoples' lives. I mean, my friend Fred even missed school to watch the fantasy movie. It is sad how many people worship that kind of stuff. I think that they should realise that the "Lord of The Rings" IS JUST A FANTASY STORY! Fantasy=not real=not pertinent to today!
<br />
<br />Tomorow I have to go on the talent show and I am afraid. Very afraid...
<br />I shouldn't be afraid, There is no purpose to being afraid. Anyways, I have getting less traffic to my site. I think that is a good thing, and a bad thing. It is a good thing because it is an obvious sign that my publicity (Code Blue) threats are subsiding. The bad thing is that it is a sign that no one listens to me, which makes me sad. All in all, it all balences out.
<br />
<br />I don't have anything else to talk about for now, so bye.
<br />
<br />BYE;)
