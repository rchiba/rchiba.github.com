Sitting in a closed room. Trying to concentrate on something, but your mind wanders away on the squirell that is jumping around outside the window. Later, you see that squirel dead, on the road. You ran over it.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have my projects done and everything is good to go. Tests were taken and everything looks fine... Except my front dive. I am terrible. I lack the skills to do a front dive. Fortunately for me, I have a knack for doing back dives. Yay, I'm good at something for once! Yippilicious.
<br />
<br />In other news, those kids with chains on their pants still freak me out. Also, I am invited to the Elmore's halloween party. I'm going to the beach on the day of the party, so I'll have to miss it. I never enjoy parties as much as I do sitting here typing. It seems really anti-social, like something some mentally-scarred, depressed hobo would do, but it comes naturally. Sitting here, just typing away. You really can get off track. It offers a sense of freedom. Like you can talk to yourself about whatever you want. In reality, I have no rights in this country because I am not a citizen. Some psycho killer living in a trailer park has more rights than I do. How can that be? First of all, that psycho killer was born in America. I was not. That is why I have no rights and he does.
<br />
<br />Anyways, the outcome of the tests, and my outcome on the diving board will be the crucial determining factors in tomorows mood. Keep an eye out for either, happylicous, or evil-frowning violent exposive mode. Most likely the latter.
