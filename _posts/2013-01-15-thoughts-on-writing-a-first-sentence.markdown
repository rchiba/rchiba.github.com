Not long ago, I found a blog post with practical advice on writing an opening sentence. When it comes to writing, putting down the opening sentence is one of my biggest challenges (Not finding ideas to write about, which I have too many of and are sometimes totally uninteresting or absurd!). IMHO, the first sentence is key in effective writing and the best openers are bipolar in nature: Fluidly transparent, yet fetching. It catches your attention, but allows the story to grip you, but without shifting your mind too far.

In the post mentioned at the top, the author brings in some patterns he's observed in other writer's first sentences, and I thought I would share a selection of interesting first sentences from my kindle's recently read. Maybe I'll find something interesting.



Ah, and if you're interested in the tips mentioned in the linked blog post, here they are as written by Kaz Thomas:

* Simply tell the reader what the subject is.
* Make a blunt statement.
* Cite a statistic.
* Tell a first-person anecdote that's relevant to the subject.
* Tell a third-person anecdote.
* Put up a straw man, then knock it down.
* Summarize a current state of affairs (or the conventional wisdom), then tell what's changed.
* Summarize previous research, then tell what new research has found.
* Involve the reader in a bit of conjecture.
* Start with a quotation from a famous figure. (But beware of triteness.)
* Commit an egregious exaggeration. Then explain what the (less extreme) reality is.
