I have uncovered an interesting hole.<br /><br />It all started out when <a href="http://www.zoomcell.com/" target="_blank"><i>zoomcell.com</i></a>, a ordinary-looking online retailer with decent customer reviews, sent me a locked cell phone when I ordered an unlocked one. The software lock prevents me from using a cellular carrier other than Cingular. An unlock code (unique for each individual phone) was not sent with the phone. <br /><br />Upon discovering that the phone was locked (by taking my mother's T-Mobile SIM card for a spin), I sent an email to Zoomcell requesting the unlock code for the new phone. I can't call them because they have no phone number listed on the website. On Friday, they sent me back an email saying:<br /><br /><i>"We have sent your IMEI to the unlocking DEPT who will respond with your code on monday, I am very very sorry for the mixup with your order!!"<br /></i><br />So, the weekend passes and nothing out of the ordinary happens. Monday comes and goes, and my inbox is empty. Zoomcell doesn't send me any emails.<br /><br />I figure that they may send it tomorrow, but the same thing happens on Tuesday. That night, I sent them an email demanding my unlock code.<br /><br />Wednesday evening, I check my inbox and find nothing. I send another demanding email to Zoomcell. By this time, I'm getting very suspicious of this retailer. Their business address is Brooklyn, New York. This is where countless fly-by-night online operations are usually based. These sorts of stores net as many people as they can with their pseudo-professional (usually prepackaged) web design, get them to pay up, then run with the money.<br /><br />Well, Zoomcell did send me my phone, so they are somewhat of a legitimate business, but they have not responded to my demands.<br /><br />On Thursday, I searched the internet and dug up a phone number. I didn't have time to call it, so I called it a few minutes ago.<br /><br />After the first ring, the answering machine message said, "<i>We are upgrading our phone services, sorry for the inconvenience. Please contact us by email at info@zoomcell.com"</i><br /><br />I don't give up.<br /><br />So, I press the "0" key.<br /><br />And lo' and behold, I get the customer service bot, which tells me that I can get ahold of them if I call them within business hours. <br /><br />Intrigued, I search the internet some more to find an extention number for Zoomcell. A comment in some random forum mentions that the very vague-named <i>"John"</i> is available at extension "885". <br /><br />I hit the phone and start dialing.<br /><br /><i> 1-800-801-7591-0-885</i><br /><br />Lo' and behold, it starts dialing "John", and it even plays the background "on hold" music while it tries to contact this person. Eventually, I even get to "John"'s voice mail.<br /><br />I'll have fun tomorrow harassing them for not sending me an unlock code, whether they are "upgrading" their phone service or not.
