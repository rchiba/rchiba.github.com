I am feeling sleepy and hot. The sun room in which im typing in is very hot indeed and there is no cooling system. I also woke up from an unexpected nap. I dont know why I am so sleepy. I just dont know. Maybe it is because I am bored. Maybe it isn't. I don't know. The fan is propelling hot and humid gasses at me and it is very uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable indeed. I am repeating my self alot right now. I want to go over to a friends house or something but everyone is somewhere. I'll probably try to call someone today or tomorow. I still haven't got to washing the dog. She is getting smellier by the second. The stench overwhelms wherever she goes. I am very tired, almost too tired to type this entry in my blog. I guess this is just another summer day...
