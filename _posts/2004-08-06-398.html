Summer is boring...
<br />
<br />But that is soon to change with the coming of high school. Muhahahah...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I don't know why I was laughing. I just felt like it. But I actually wasn't laughing. I just wrote "Muhahahah" but I am actually sitting here in front of my computer typing. Don't you hate it when people go "lol" every 3rd line? Even though what you said isn't even remotely funny? It infuriates me, but I do it alot, so I can't complain. Anyways. I'm changing the poll. Here are the results for this poll:
<br />
<br />Where do you live?
<br /> 
<br />In Lafayette, Indiana 5 (8%) 
<br />	
<br />Not in Lafayette, Indiana 6 (10%) 
<br />	
<br />Next to Matt Lukasak 9 (15%) 
<br />	
<br />In space 3 (5%) 
<br />	
<br />In cyberspace 10 (16%)
<br />
<br />It seems like matt is again the popular vote. Very interesting... Well, be sure to vote on my extra-unscientific poll for no reason! Also, I put a new button to wikipedia. Your one stop source for information! I don't work for them... No really. I don't... Don't look at me like that.
