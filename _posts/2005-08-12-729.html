I've always wanted to be the best at something. The best painter, the best writer, the best thinker. The fastest, the smartest, the most witty. Unfortunately, the only thing I'm the best at is sleeping very quietly. Ever since my friend's little sister told me that I slept quietly, I've seen myself as the best at being a silent slumberer. Isn't it great to think that you're the best at something? I mean, even if you aren't the best at what you think you're good at, thinking that you are the best is as empowering as stocking the Vatican City with nukes. <br /><br />In other news, I was overwhelmed by the intellectuality of the Second Life furry fans. They are all just so darn witty. It makes me feel like some white trash hick who watches "West Coast Choppers" and "WWF." And it seems like everyone is from Seattle. What's the deal? WHY IS EVERYONE IN SEATTLE!?<br /><br />Fruit, I've lost my mind. Did you know that I've always wanted to be the bes... <br /><br />Oh.. Yes... I've already said that haven't I. I must really be not getting enough sleep. My quality of life is being influenced by the metaverse. Must succumb to the amazing metaverse. Derr...<br /><br />Like I said, sleep...<br /><br />or something like that.
