<span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Black Friday post</span></span><br /><br /><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/320/217796/PB243972.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><strong>First stop</strong>: Best Buy<br /><ul><li>My morning starts off with a chilling fifteen minute wait outside the doors of the local Best Buy. Above is a picture of dozens of people waiting behind the road just before the stampede starts. In the bottom corner of the photograph, a police car sits. After this morning, I can understand why they needed law enforcement. Pushing, shoving, bumping. The doors are opened and the crowd gushes through in a solid mass. It's shoulder to shoulder, and employees are being dragged here and there. <span style="font-style: italic;">"Where's this? Where's that? Don't you have any more of those left!? MY CHRISTMAS IS RUINED!"</span> I trail behind a muscular looking guy, and I get to where I want to be. My parents want me to pick up a photo printer. Little kids dart between my feet, clawing to get to the $4.99 100-pack of Dynex DVD's. I take a crumpled picture of the printer from my pocket. The model numbers match, so I pick up a box and run for the cash register line. With each passing second, the line grows, snaking through appliances, through furniture, then finally all the way to the back of the store, near home theater. Crazy...<br /></li></ul><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/320/863327/PB243974.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><strong>Second Stop</strong>: Radio Shack<br />After stashing the printer, ink, and photo paper in the car, I'm free to do whatever I want. I <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> have gone home to eat breakfast, but with the mall across the street, I couldn't help peeking in and seeing the mayhem. A lone Radio Shack is crammed with people, the line streches a few stores down. The Radio Shack is just that, a <span style="font-style: italic;">shack</span>. The size of the store compared to the amount of people trying to get in was absurd. I shoved my way into the fray for fun. People yelling, calling their relatives, confusion, confusion, confusion.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/1600/9235/PB243975.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/320/397664/PB243975.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Third Stop</strong>: GameStop<br /><ul><li>GameStop was a little more rational by limiting the number of customers allowed into the store. I happened to be part of the second group of people to be let in. Thus, I stood witness to many shattered dreams. At least five people came in excited, asked about the Wii, were told about its sellout, and walked out sulking or irate. However, my dreams were in no such condition.<br /></li></ul><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/1600/290597/PB243977.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/320/164884/PB243977.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Inside GameStop: The Wii<br /><ul><li>My first thoughts: <span style="font-style: italic;">"THE WII! <span style="font-weight: bold;">OH MY FUCKING GOD,</span> IT'S A WII."</span> Noticing that there was no controller in sight, I ask the man behind the counter. He trades me my camera for a Wii-mote. I spend the next fifteen minutes in nintendo nirvana. Curious shoppers gather around me as I embarass myself playing Excite Truck. Finally noticing the sad faces of children around me, I force myself to let go of the plastic rectangle of ecstasy and pass it on to another lucky fanboy.<br /></li></ul><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/1600/611497/PB243981.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/320/909825/PB243981.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Fourth Stop</strong>: Office Depot<br /><ul><li>On my drive home from the mall, I remember seeing an advertisement for cheap photo paper at Office Depot. By now, two hours of time have passed, so I enter the store with a grim outlook, expecting the line to be excruciatingly long and products to be sold out. I am surprised to find the $3.99 photo paper. I wasn't as lucky about the line. I spend the next half-hour waiting in a line that moved in shuffles, not steps.</li></ul><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/320/345613/PB243988.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br />I return to my car. The sun begins to scroll above the horizon. My Black Friday bonanza is over. I drive home with the trophies of my effort in the back seat. A cheap, brand-name, compact photo printer.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3367/196/320/627735/PB243991.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br />Who knew it took so much packaging to get a printer from a factory to someone's house?<span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
