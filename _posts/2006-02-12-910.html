It's the end of the week already, and my procrastinating self has yet again put off all important tasks to the last hour.<br /><br />Before I go to sleep, I must practice my speech, study for my French test, practice my English presentation, and practice my clarinet. <br /><br />In all honesty, I should have done all of these things earlier. Unfortunately, I have not. Thus, I must rush to accomplish these tasks in the next 55 mins. <br /><br />Wish me good luck.
