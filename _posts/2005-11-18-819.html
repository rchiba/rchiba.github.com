I added some colorful buttons to spruce up the page. These buttons are there to describe who I am, what I use, and misc. things about me. Clicking on the buttons will lead you to more information about that aspect of who I am, albeit on a third-party site.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm up late, looking for an encyclopedia for my iPAQ, but I'm not coming up with anything. I remember, a year ago, I had an encyclopedia for my older model, but it all got erased in the "Great Hard Drive Crash of 2004". Yes, it was a horrible moment. Wait, maybe it was the "Great Hard Drive Crash of 2003". I can't quite remember, but I do remember a hard drive crashed, and the trauma that followed.<br /><br />For three days now, Alex and I have been conversing via email, and it's been very neat. This is the first time someone like me is out there, someone who has no problem having a conversation over email, someone who's prompt and articulate. For the first time in my life, I feel like I'm really talking to another human over email.<br /><br />Previous emails in my life were usually one sentence long back-and-forth nonsense. It was mindless bantering that went no where, and had no purpose. Each email sent was basically a witty counter-comment to the email recieved. For the longest time, I accepted this as a fact of life. I accepted it that I would never be able to find someone who checks their email more than once every two hours. I accepted that everyone used netspeak, everyone used email to forward junk. The sad thing is, I was never, until now, able to find someone who uses email so avidly as I do. Previously, it seemed that the only reason everyone used email was to occasionally send a text file or song, but not for deep conversation. The topics I'm discussing with Alex right now may not be the most deep, but it sure is something new. It's like rediscovering your favorite toy, finding it in a dusty corner of a closet, putting fresh batteries in it, and being delighted by its newfound glory. <br /><br />Alex seems to be the key to my email salvation. <br /><br />And so,<br /><br />Email will rise again.
