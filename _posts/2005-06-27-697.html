I drove with my instructor around the city today. It was very easy. Almost as easy as tying a cat to a stick and injuring anyone within a 3 foot radius with it. Yes it was that easy. Or, it was as easy as eating "funny" mushrooms and jumping off of a bridge, thinking that the water below is really poofy marshmellows. Or, it was as easy as taking that old hard drive that crashed on you while you were downloading your 50 GB file using dial up and destroying it with a blowtorch. Or, it was as easy as pushing the off button on a computer that really is what holds the world together because it's a magical computer of gravity. Whichever scenario you choose, it was quite easy.<br /><br />I'm tired now, and I was thinking of writing more Mr. Smith stories. Maybe a book. Book deals make me envious. Yes, Amanda, someday when you're a millionaire and I'm living in my cardboard box, I'll have my revenge on something so insignificant that I shouldn't really care about it but I do anyways even though we're friends. Hopefully.
