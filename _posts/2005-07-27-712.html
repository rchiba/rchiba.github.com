I have returned.<br /><br />Between the excruciating plane rides, rude customs officials, lack of good television, lack of computer, automobile exhaust air, constant awkward moments, language barrier, CD buying binge, mosquitos, jet lag, and polluted water, the trip went well.<br /><br />But, after going through 13 hours of being strapped into a chair on a 600mph flying metal behemoth, 6 hours of Chicago O'Hare craptactular delays, and 2 hours of customs I'm in no shape to sit here, awake. Especially at this hour. <br /><br />Blech. Lesson of the day: Don't eat the airplane food.
