Ok, fine, I splurged on the 64 pack of crayons.<br /><br />I think it's so odd that I've established these pseudo-relationships with the colors. Like <span style="font-style:italic;">brick red</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">purple mountain majesty</span>. Colors that I used ten years ago, and colors I use today. I remember grabbing handfuls of crayons just to figure out what kinds of funky names they had stamped on their covers. I never really understood how anyone could tastefully use all 64 of them. And I never understood why they are arranged so randomly in the box. They should organize it by hues, so users can pick out colors with ease. Not hunt and peck for that darned mahogany crayon.<br /><br />Things are looking positive. I'm rested and ready for school. I believe this has been an excellent weekend. I hope the coming week will be equally wonderful.<br /><br />Because there's no point in moping around. There isn't. <br /><br />PS:<span style="font-style:italic;">Who would have known that crayons can color on laptops too?</span>
