Weird dreams:<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">I wake up to a brightly lit hallway. Walls are beige, floors linoleum, air recycled. All around me are my friends. They talk and laugh, joke with each other. The hallways are crowded, I see no windows. I start to walk around, and as my vision comes to me, I see other hallways that branch out from the main hallway.<br /><br />Looking down at the floor, I see hundreds of plastic shopping bags. I suppose they just appeared. Everyone in the hallway simultaneously picks them up. They mput them on their heads, seal the connection between the edge of the bag and their neck. <br /><br />I panic.<br /><br />Running, screaming, ripping bags off of heads, yelling at people I care about the most. <br /><br />But when they notice me, they just laugh and joke around. Their faces show no sign of distress. Do they notice the bags? Mindless drivel comes out of their mouths, I don't understand, they appear happy.  <br /><br />My head spins, I'm hysterical, crying, confused. I start to shove people out of my way, moving my legs as fast as I can, trying to get out this massive group suicide / plastic bag hat celebration.<br /><br />At the end of one of the hallways is a window. Outside is a senic view of wooded cliffs overlooking a sparkling ocean.<br /><br />A man takes my hand and leads me to a chair. <br /><br />"Do I have a disease where I lose my memory every day?"<br />"No."<br />"Then what is this?"<br />"You have a disease where you see words on things that don't exist."<br /></span><br /> <br />I wake up.
