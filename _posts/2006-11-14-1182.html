<span style="font-style:italic;">Due to my utter lazyness, I will now post my english essay. Please, before reading this, understand that the ideas expressed below may not be the same ideas I hold now. Understand that I'm fine, and that a lot of what I wrote below was for creative effect. Understand.</span><br /><br />We sit at a table made of particleboard. Holding greasy, plastic rods with little red buttons on the end, the team gets ready. With a fierce rapidity, questions are asked and answered. Red and yellow, the lights flash. Both witty quips and candies are passed around as tumultuous laughter enlightens the room. So begins the Tuesday afternoon Quizbowl practice. My watch reads two-fifty.<br /><br />Each and every Tuesday, I come to this "practice" through brute willpower to fulfill a false obligation. One may not understand the magnitude of the weight situated on my conscience. If only my peers would understand how blatantly uncultured I am. My cognitive contribution to the team sums to nothing. Shakespeare, chemistry, middle eastern rivers, and others are topics of great confusion for me. Truly, this is information that violently cuts the line between mentally fashionable and unfashionable. I sit in an unfavorable spot.<br /><br />The writhing angst and inner backlash shred into morsels of my confidence won from a victorious clash against a recent physics test. We sit at a table made of particleboard, but still I sit alone. A pen and a rectangle of paper meant for math calculations are my only exit. I draw, scribble, and write spiteful messages to myself. I do anything to control my anxiety. The teacher reads, but I do not hear. I clench the buzzer, but do not feel. My only objective is to control my emotions, to keep from outright crying. The future becomes present, trivia questions are asked, and I see no spring of hope. Not even a trickle to be found.<br /><br />Simply, the activity was not meant for me. I, a naturally simple-minded and dull person, should not be participating. Defying good reason, I have continued, and a problem has become of it. One should note that a problem of this nature does not plateau. No, this gnawing guilt has matured through these high school years. It has matured into a dangerous beast.<br /><br />I often question my role on the team. Why must I force myself to continue? Always, I hurriedly hide the truth from myself. Through false hope and hallucinated idealism, I convince my mind to bear with the torment. I deceive myself into believing that trudging through such thickened mud will make a stronger person out of me.<br /><br />The lights stop flashing, the buzzers stop ringing. Team members file out of the door as practice ends. I sit in a dark, empty room. My eyes drift from hand to hand as I take a deep breath and ask, "When will I reach the truth?"
