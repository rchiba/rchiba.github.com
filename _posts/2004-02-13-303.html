Hello, average Yo reporting in from Devin's house.
<br />I am having quite a nice time at Devin's house. His parents are nice and Devin is too. We tried snowboarding with sleds on this crap hill that is just a stub on the ground. Devin could go far, but I could never get far. His computer runs on cable and it runs super fast and I am amazed at his luck and supurb internet quality. He downloaded this song in 10 seconds that took me 30 minuites to download. It amazing and I have seen the light. My dad is just going to keep my dial-up so whats the point of groping stupidly and uselessly.
<br />
<br />Anyways, today was the party, which is the most stupid waste of everyones time. I think that this kind of useless spending of money should be terminated immediately and with consequence to all those that follow. I hate those people who go to the party and act like they are cool and then they shall see... See what is in store for them in the future... We shall all see. I am thinking of taking monthly checks on all the popular people and all the normal and seeing if I can see any correlation between sucess and failure.
