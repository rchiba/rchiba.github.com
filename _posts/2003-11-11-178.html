<br />Anyways, I got several awards in 2nd period, 3 as a matter of fact. Then everyone started to look at me like a geek. That was very unpleasant, but a triumphant moment, for a while. We had 2 tests today. I think I did pretty good on both. I NEED good scores on those tests, or else.... Anyways,( can't stop saying that word!) Anyways, we had veterans day and all that, was very interesting. And, thats about it. My life is boring. I wish there were more things to talk about, but hey, my life is fine....

<br />Anyways, I spent alot of time today on my math homework. Easy stuff, but it takes forever on paper. I feel tired, and guess what? My dad is making me go to the gym in a second. yay, not. Arghhh...might as well go instead of vegging out at the computer....
