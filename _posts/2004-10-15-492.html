I went to Buffalo Wild Wings for a Quiz Bowl outing. I was the only "freshie" there. Anyways, I thought it was a really smoky place. I can't immagine anyone being able to live in that kind of environment. I was half-gasping after 2 hours. That smoke lingers in your hair, eyes, and clothes. It's so third-world. I can't believe that America is tolerating this, but I guess that's what chemicals do to your brain.

<br />I was talking to my Biology teacher at the Quiz Bowl outing (she's the coach) and we were talking about education systems, public schools, teachers, etc, and I was thinking... If I was stuck in a "average" class back when I was in kindergarten. If I was stuck there, and was stuck in the "average" classes until I graduated, I would miss alot. Think about it. Kid A goes to an "average" class and kid B goes to an "excellerated" class. Let's say that kid B learns twice as much as kid A. That means that by those kid's senior year, kid B would have learned 13 more years worth of material than kid A. It would suck to be kid A, but alot of people are.

<br />Anyways, it's late at night and I can't get to sleep because of a caffine rush that I am on from Buffalo Wild Wings. Too much soda. Plus, it's my sisters birthday party and I'm afraid of going to sleep. 5 little girls. Dangerous...

<br />In other news, I've made a nightstand out of AOL disk cartons. It's rather fashionable. I will post a picture of it someday. I really like it. I think I've collected 140 AOL Cd's. Maybe more. Something like that. Right now, I'm discussing my destroyed camera with Devin. I need it back and he justifies that it isn't his fault because he didn't do anything to it. Even though it wasn't his fault, I can't just ignore the fact that my camera is broken. This is quite a delima.
