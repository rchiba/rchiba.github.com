Blog-thing, hey. I think I'm going to be sick. I'm so nervous and panicky and all for a stupid reason. You see, a friend, probably my best friend in the whole wide world, called me today out of the blue. I haven't see her in six years and we're going to meet up at the movies tomorrow. 
<br />I dunno why I'm so nervous. It's so stupid for me to be, but here I am, all pukey and wishy washy. Oi vey, some one kick me. This is so stupid. I guess I'm just worried she'll hate me or she might be working for Don.
<br />But she wouldn't stoop that low. She's my friend.. oi vey, here I go again. I'll tell you about it tomorrow...
<br />~Amanda
