Good morning to myself.
<br />
<br />I am supposed to savor every waking moment of today. Every second that I am not at school on a normal school day. Every second breathing free air. Seeing free sights. Savoring the taste of my childhoon. 
<br />
<br />Tomorow I will return to my school, exposing myself to new hazards. I will be thrust into a defensive position. New scenarios, new people, new harassments. I will have to sit, and talk, to people I do not want to. I will have to be shoved around, anonymously, in the tide of the crowd. I will have to deal with it. It will happen tomorow, and the nexc day, and the next day... Fate has already decided what will happen. If I will be killed in a school shooting, or if I get an A on a test I studied for. Fate is so reassuring. It (If you can even consider it an entity) tells tells you that every thing has already happened. It is no one's fault. In essence, you can blame anything that happens to you on "fate". That is so comforting sometimes.
<br />
<br />In reality, I have nothing to fear. School will come and pass.
<br />
<br />I've got an idea. I will savor every waking moment while alive. What's so bad about school anyways? I should be grateful that I'm not in a poor African nation. I should celebrate that I get to go to school, and I will. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, this morning should not be scornful. It should be jubilant. 
<br />
<br />The final verdict? School is better than Death.
