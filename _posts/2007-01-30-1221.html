Is there a point to mulling over things?<br /><br />Just sitting there and feeling sorry for yourself. Wanting to pound the desk, and then pound your face into the desk. Wanting to hurt, but not to die. Wanting nothing, the comprehension that you don't deserve what you've got. That some poor kid in a western European country would walk a thousand miles barefoot just to sit in such a classroom. Knowing that it really doesn't mean anything. Your feelings. Your effort. The mess on the floor, the clarity of the sky.<br /><br />But, still, there is an unthinking core that ignores the facts and pursues the primal instincts to <span style="font-style: italic;">feel</span>.<br /><br />The cafeteria is filled with people you don't know in colorful outfits, spouting foul language, watching <span style="font-style: italic;">The Price is Right</span>. And you realize that they don't mean anything. They just <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span>. They'll "grow up". Whatever that means.<br /><br />And the classroom is filled with trendy collared shirts and tidy sweaters. And someone finishes the test before another person. And you think about how much of a failure you are. But, you know, <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span>, that you aren't a failure. And you're just saying this because it makes you feel <span style="font-weight: bold;">safe</span>, for some reason beyond comprehension.
