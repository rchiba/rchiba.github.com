I had alot of weird people IM me today. First there was this odd person, and in the middle of our conversation (we were trying to figure out why I was on her contact list, she told me to "f*ck off". Then she cut off. Then there was this person who called himself "Milo" and told me that I stole his toy in 2nd grade when he was playing with Ryan Powell. This was funny, because I moved here in 6th grade, so there was no way I could even know him or ryan powell or steal his toy. His accusations were humorous, but he kept on saying that I lost in this "game". I think he is obviously confused. Then there was this other person who knew Kevin Barlow (supposedly) and that is where his contact list came from. This person was very obscene and confused. THEN there was this person whos screen name showed up as AIMAdministrator55555 or something like that. This person claimed to be the co-ceo of AIM Corp. He told me he was Cristopher II or something like that. He said that he had physical evidence (another hilarious detail) of me harassing somebody on AIM. First of all, there is no AIM corp, and second of all, there is no "physical evidence" on cyberspace. This person told me that I harassed this person that I didn't even know. Yea. Hilarious. I don't harass people, nor steal, nor want to talk to these strange and illusioned people. It was very intreguing though.

<br />On other news, I cleaned out my binder and it had alot of papers. Like, enough to make a small tree. I might post some pictures of it later. In the binder I found some year old fruit snacks which were oddly hard and were caked with a white powder. I also found fragments or pens, pencils, and an old christmas card. I salvaged a few things, but most of it was junk. That's all for right now.
