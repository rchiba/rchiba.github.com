I'm feeling nervous at this time because of the orientation at harrison. I'm supposed to meet new people and this is supposed to make me happy, but not so at this time. Anyways, I found this nice game that used to cost money, but now the company's promoting its sequel so they made it free. It's called hidden and dangerous. Enough about those evil programs (that I can't resist) called games.
<br />
<br />Don't you hate it when people say, "don't use big words on me" or something of that nature? I do. I say a word like, "catastrophe", or "coniferous", or "mammal" and these people explain to me their mental handicap. Instead or making me use the only 7 letter word these people know ("thingie") to substitute for words that are 6 letters and up, they should enhance their vocabulary. And to think, these people are going into the workforce!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I might be able to go to the 7th grade party after orientation, but there is a slight chance that it will be too late. Ta ta.
