Personally, I think it's a poor business model to have your smallest drink be a "medium". <br /><br />I arrive at the local fast food establishment because it's been a dull day. Once in a blue moon, I eat fast food. I did today. So there I am, in front of the cashier.<br /><br />It hits me like a train. I know who the cashier is. She went to middle school with me. She's even mentioned in this blog deep in the archives. <br /><br />Awkward silence. I adjust my glasses and hope she doesn't recognize me. I avert my eyes to the various fatty foodstuffs that decorate the walls. I order, she pushes numbers. I continue to avert my eyes, keeping tabs on things using only peripheral vision. As she continues to pushes numbers, she calls on a manager to ask how to work the register. The manager comes and she's talking to him. I steal a glance and confirm the identity of the cashier. Tense, I quickly look away. She starts pushing buttons on the register again. She starts looking at my in an odd manner, trying to confirm my identity. I attempt stifle the embarassing blush that is starting to develop. An awkward silence continues to culminate as suspense is hightened. By now, I know that I'm done for. She recognizes me.<br /><br />"Is your name Ryo?"<br /><br />She says it, and I blush for five seconds before replying. <br /><br />"Yes, it must be the glasses. It's hard to recognize me with my glasses on."<br /><br />I say it, blushing, tense, and stuttering, trying to justify my silly, antisocial behavior.<br /><br />"Huh... I couldn't tell...", she says skeptically.<br /><br />Silence continues until my order is up. I grab the goodies and stumble toward the door.<br /><br />As I walk toward the car, I start feeling calmer. My pulse lowers and my mind is and body becomes less tense. The hairs on my body no longer stand on end, but instead relax.<br /><br />I get in the car, put the keys in the ignition, and grin.<br /><br />I'm so glad someone noticed me today.
