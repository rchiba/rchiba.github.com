I better churn this out quick or else I'll miss my sleep deadline. Without adequate nocturnal preparation for school, and school-related activities, the world around me will be come a big mess of swirling colors and derailed hopes of high marks.<br /><br />This afternoon, I realized that one of my rolls of double sided tape is larger than the other. I've had the two rolls of coveted double-sided for the past year or so, and since then I've never noticed the size difference. They have just been innocently sitting on my desk, but all this time they must have planned for this to happen. My rolls of tape must have planned that I would eventually notice their size difference. <br /><br />This may not be a significant discovery for you, but for me I saw this enlightenment as a lesson. A lesson that details amount to nothing, as long as the job gets done. My rolls of tape do their job, and they've done their job even though I haven't taken note of details.<br /><br />For this reason, I disagree with my English teacher. Her motto has something to do about little details, as she is maniacally obsessed with details. Half a centimeter off on the margin spacing? Header on the wrong side? Underlining instead of italicizing? Those would all be significant point deductions.<br /><br />I see no point to this madness. If one was to write a paper, it's content is what matters, not if the protocols were precisely followed. This is not the USSR. This is a country that rewards flexibility and the ability to get the job done, to improvise. Conformity is devalued in a society so diverse. So why should English papers be the same way? If anything, not following proper protocols would just result in a longer grading time, and I suppose she has justification in punishing students for that. But, making or breaking grade based on the "proper" location of a parenthetical citation? I see that as absurd.<br /><br />But I have nothing to worry about. As long as I stay as maniacally obsessed with the "important" details in my paper as she is maniacally obsessed with counting off points for the details, I'll be safe. <br /><br />Forever, I must remember that life rewards the vigilant.
