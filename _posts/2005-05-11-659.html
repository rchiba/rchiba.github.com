I have updated my photos with another doodle if you wanted to see, as if you would anyways.<br /><br />I suppose tomorrow I will be frantic in general since I have to fit in a band concert, a quizbowl practice, and a mayhem biology study session. I can't wait, but as if you care.<br /><br />I have to relax to prepare myself for tomorrow, so I suppose I'll rant on more about life later. Not now. Now is not so exciting.<br /><br />But actually, something is exciting in my life. Life in general. My French teacher pointed out to the class that she uses extremely large ammounts of energy to engage us in learning French. She thought that we were all lethargic this morning, so she was in a serious tone and read us a story about a holocaust survivor to get us to appreciate life more. I hate it when she generalizes the feelings of the class like that. I was excited for the day. I was practicing smiling and I wasn't lethargic at all. We aren't emotionless animals that are on cohesive unit, so she can't just get all serious because most of us seem to be supposedly "dazed!" No more generalization! But, I see her point in doing all of this. I suppose reading us a story about a holocaust survivor is much better than the "paddle and whip" method of teaching. It is also much better than Amanda's "chainsaw re-education" method of teaching.<br /><br />On the note of Amanda, I've packed a laptop briefcase full of about 15 Japanese comics. It looks very similar to some kind of explosive device, so I'm hoping that the school officials will not see the bag. Let's hope.
