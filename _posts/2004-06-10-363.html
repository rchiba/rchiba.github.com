My modem was fried in a large storm so I couldn't get on the internet for the past month. It's been excruciating without internet, but it's here, and better than ever because... NOW I HAVE BROADBAND. Wewt! I use the opera browser, because it is better than the generic internet explorer that everyone else has. Anyways, my camera is here and it rocks. Summer gym is hard, but easier than I thought. I have a summer gym exam tomorow, so I have to study. Well, more updates will hopefully follow.
