You know what? I still don't understand a lot of things in this world. <br /><br />One of the things I don't understand is why other peoples' email addresses have stupid names. <br /><br />Take for example Kaiser Andrew's email address. His email is baconboy936@msn.com. Why is his insignia "baconboy936"? Is Andrew truely a "baconboy"? What kind of effect does bacon have in his life? Does he have some kind of bacon fetish, or has bacon inspired him to become so great. The number "936" also stirrs up mystery. Does Andrew have 936 cows and pigs? Does Andrew plan to date 936 women? Does Andrew have 936 marbles that he puts in 936 shot glasses that he picked up on 936 vacations to Disney World in Florida? Perhaps, Andrew has a hidden chamber under his house that is filled with 936 gadgets to thwart morons. Or maybe his computer only has 936 MegaBytes left in the hard drive. Maybe 936 is a anagram for...<br /><br />Whatever it is, the mysterious number 936 will always be shrouded in conspiracy. Will we ever know what 936 means? And, what is this "baconboy"???<br /><br /><br />In other news, I'm planning a webcomic (I know, I'm a loser for doing it after Ryan has already done it twice), but hey. Perhaps I'll outdo Ryan just to show that I've got mad skillz too. Maybe it'll impress Amanda. That would be the world for me.
