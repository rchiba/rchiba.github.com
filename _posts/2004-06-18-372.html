Hello blog-thing! I have just finished another work out. I did 3 sets of heavy duty weight lifting which included curls and lifts, and then I did a medium set where I lie down to work my...triceps I think. Of course I did squats, lunges, stretches, ab tighteners, ab crunchers, ab stretches, and 40 sit ups. Earlier today I walked for 64 minutes, only stopping halfway to get a drink for about a minute. Then I went bike ridding for an hour or two with a friend, nearly screwed up my knee again, and did 1.75 miles in track. Only 7 laps, oh well...I can always strive for eight. 
<br />You must be thinking that I'm complaining, but I assure you I'm not! I don't know what the heck has gotten not me, maybe my self esteem, but I just want to exercise! It feels so good! I forget if I've mentioned it, but I can't believe I used to just sit and eat! I missed out on the wonderful world around me, regrettably. I hope this summer does me well. I even got some special cream that is supposed to help to! Cross your fingers folks, because I'm SO keeping to this plan! lol
<br />Anyways, talk with ya later!
<br />~Amanda
