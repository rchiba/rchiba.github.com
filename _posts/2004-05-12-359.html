Still working on the Kow Studios venture. Devin just won't get the job done.
<br />Average Yo reporting. He thought that he had a DVD burner but it is just a reader. He is so stupid, ugh. Anyways, I am still obsesed with "Kingdom of Loathing". It's great. Anyways, in social studies, this huge "disscussion" (discussion=pointless one-sided talking) on inappropriate t-shirts and the banning of sandals at school. It was a total pointlessness. I don't see how Lexi can change anything by talking out in social studies. Ugh... A stupid waste of my time. Anyways, it's coming closer to the end of the year. So close...
