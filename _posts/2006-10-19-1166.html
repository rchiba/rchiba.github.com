Envy is shallow. It's a strong, passionate feeling though, primal as it is. A very basic tier of emotion.<br /><br />So, I'll tell you the truth and tell you that I was in a state of envy today. Envious, because from my blurry eyes, the world is lashing out at me. So I lash out at the world. Stages, there are stages of compensation. A setback, then another. They add up. I help Nik with his math and he gets a higher grade than me. I volunteer after school to help fundraise and the profit goes to the other person. I take a two hour nap and I stay up three hours later. <br /><br /><b>Please don't listen to me. Everybody has everyday problems. How do I justify my complaints? I can't. I'll do it here and call myself a bad person.</b><br /><br />But, things happen to me still. My stages:<ul><br /><li>First comes the grief. Complaining. Annoying friends. Hating myself, but I can't stop. I know it's pointless, but it makes <i>me</i> feel better. A sinking feeling of selfishness sets in. Then guilt.</li><br /><li>Second comes the skin-deep acceptance. I tell myself that it's alright, I know it's not. I know I'm not <i>deep</i> enough to overcome my obstacles through sheer willpower. I'm only whispering sweet nothings to myself so I'll get over it. Soon, the structure crumbles and my faux-optimism falls through.</li><br /><li>Third comes fear. Pacing mindlessly around the empty newspaper room, throwing my hands up and deliriously hitting myself against heavy objects, explaining to myself the consequences of my mistakes. Cursing under my breath. The heart races, I look for an escape. When I realize there is none, I feel helpless.</li><br /><li>Fourth comes the envy. It's someone else's fault. Other people are against me. I was born this way. Excuses, excuses, excuses.<br /><li>Fifth comes the weekend. When monday rolls around, start the cycle back up</li></ul><br /><br /><strike>So what if Andrew is deep? Huh? Why can't I be deep? I must be deformed, incapable, something's <b>wrong</b> with me to make it so that I <b>can't</b> be deep. And Josh can write stories. Yay. I can't do that either.</strike> <br /><br />These malicious thoughts pull me down further.
