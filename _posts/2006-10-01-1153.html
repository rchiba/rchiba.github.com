About a month ago, Devin said to me, "<i>What's the point of your blog anyway? I tried writing for a little bit, then I realized how stupid it is to write bunches of meaningless crap.</i>"<br /><br />I nervously laughed a little so I could pretend that I half agreed with him. But, as I walked away, I felt discouraged.<br /><br />"<i>Am I wasting my time?</i>"<br /><br />A few weeks later, the school newspaper came out. I uneasily opened the cheap newsprint and flipped through the smudged text to look for my articles. I couldn't find them. So I looked again. Hopeless. <br /><br />None of my articles were published.<br /><br />And so I accepted the fact that I'm a mediocre writer. I also tried to accept the fact that I went out of my comfort zone to interview people on my own time, to come up with my questions, to piece together the quotes to write a story, to sit in my room and erase and erase and rewrite and rewrite, the fact that all of those things were now worthless because the articles were thrown away. <br /><br />Evan wrote his articles the day <i>they were due</i>, he wrote them sitting next to me, in <i>thirty minutes</i> of free time. He got all of his articles published. <br /><br />The event discouraged me greatly.<br /><br />I understand that not everyone wins, that maybe the majority of the school has different taste in reading than I do. But, why couldn't they stick me in the corner of a page somewhere? Instead of putting a medium-sized picture of Evan Rebar in the center of "Evan's Corner", maybe they could have shrunk my story and pasted it there.<br /><br />It didn't happen that way though. So, I'll walk away and try again. There isn't much to life than that. Lose, lose, lose, win. <br /><br />It's hard to find the motivation to write now. It's disheartening to spend time and effort doing something you know will be discarded and forgotten. Whatever writing it may be. An English essay, a blog post, an email to an acquaintance, they get written very slowly, as if I'm trying to worsen my issues with time management.<br /><br />I haven't written here in a long time. I haven't written in a number of things in a long time. To click that briefcase open, to load up w.bloggar, to grab my pen with the same passion I did weeks, months, years ago is impossible to imagine now. It's not the same anymore. The noise my keyboard makes is sad, the keys are pushed slowly, carefully, and I have to ask myself, "Where are <i>my</i> ideas? Where is <i>my</i> bravado? Where is my <b>inspiration?</b> Did I even have any before? What could I have done with all of that <i>wasted time</i>?" I can't look at these utensils for creation without feeling pathetic.<br /><br />Andrew once told me, <i>"I hate the weekends, they give you too much time to think."</i><br /><br />I couldn't have agreed with him more.
