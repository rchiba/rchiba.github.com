Currently, I'm in a semi-panic mode. <br /><br />My literature book for English has gone missing. Ordinarily, this statement would not be as concerning for me, but due to the fact that I must use it for a test tomorrow (and study for it tonight) this statement worries me. I called a friend to see if I left it in his car to no avail. That's strike one. The next course of action is to look in my locker. Regrettably, I remember taking it out of my locker. This means it could be anywhere in the school. If my book is indeed not in my locker, I will get in contact with the teachers that may have recovered my lost book. If that does not succeed, I have no choice but to hope that some kind soul will let me borrow their book for my period. Then comes the arduous (and most likely fruitless) search for the lost book. Alas, I leave tomorrow for a 4-day robotics competition. Thus complicates my situation further. Bah, I'm stuck in a rut with false hope. I'll be so crushed when I can't find my book tomorrow.<br /><br />I went to a restaurant fundraiser for one of my most respected teachers. Having not seen many of the teachers for two years furthered my excitement as I saw my educational past stroll by me in line to the cashier. The whole building was packed with people, the line to the food went out of the door. Quite a sight to behold. Seeing teachers from years (yes, I can say "years" now because I've been apart from them for 2 years) ago instigated thoughts pertaining to age. Inevitably, there was an essence of extra age that could be seen in the eyes of the people from the past. With age comes death. And that is sad.<br /><br />Sad not because death is sad. Sad because life is sad. Exponential decay in the form of flesh and blood, free radicals and mitochondria, even at the molecular level, we age. And so entropy continues to prove itself at every corner.<br /><br />An exception to that is my desk, which somehow has the ability to stay clean.
