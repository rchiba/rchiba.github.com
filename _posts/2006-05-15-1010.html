Monday. Today was a Monday. I wished it was a Friday, but it didn't happen.<br /><br />French class could have been worse. The teacher came back from her one week hiatus. At first, I was afraid that things would get awkward fast, as many of us had been under the impression that the teacher's mother had died. Luckily, that was not the case. I can only imagine the horror that we, as French students, would have to endure if our teacher became emotionally unstable due to a death in her family. If her mother had died, we would be sitting sitting in a combat zone of frenzy, waiting for our ultimate doom, the French final written by a crazed and/or depressed and/or maniacal teacher. <br /><br />So I'm sitting in class, relieved that the future wasn't so grim as I had originally thought. The teacher decided to spend the whole day calculating and giving us our grades. I tore off a half-sheet of notebook paper and wrote my name on it, then handed it in. A few minutes later, the paper finds its way back to my desk. On it are three numbers, written in red pen. <br /><br />98% 87% 93%<br /><br />I then realize that the first number is my first semester grade, my second my second semester grade, and the third an average. Then I mull over how I shot myself in the foot during second semester, and what happened that caused the pull of the trigger. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep from Robotics. Perhaps it was me just getting lazy near the end of the year. Perhaps I'm a failure. Whatever the case, the change is surprising. It bothers me that I pay such close attention to things so unimportant as mere numbers, but at this point in my life, it seems that everything hinges on numbers. My future, my luck, my algebra II homework. All have to do with numbers.<br /><br />While I mull over my numbers, a girl from the back of the classroom is escorted to the front of the room. Just as I tilt my head up, I realize why she is being escorted, and why she was being escorted to the place that she was. At the front of the classroom, there is a cheap, plastic wastebasket that's about as high as the waist. Inside, there are a few papers, and random bits of plastic from shattered mechanical pencils. Because I sit very close to the front of the classroom, I sit very close to the wastebasket. So, I'm surprised when I look up to see the girl leaning over the wastebasket.<br /><br />Vomit.<br /><br />The girl who was escorted to the front of the room vomits into the black container. The yellow digestive juices, and other miscellaneous items of interest, flowed out of the girl's mouth like a xanthous stream. Not very pleasant, the sound, the smell, the view. So, I look back down at my numbers, trying to look as nonchalant as possible. A few seconds pass, and then I hear vomiting noises once again. Out of curiosity, I can't help but looking up. So, I do. She vomits two more times before being able to exit the classroom, albeit carrying the now biohazard-containing wastebasket with her. <br /><br />Looking back to my numbers, I realize something. People are much more interesting than numbers. I'm sure people are much more important than numbers as well. So, I dismiss my poor grade and exit the room feeling moderately positive.<br /><br />This attitude is quickly gagged and decapitated in the next period, when I got the results from my standardized math testing back. I did very poorly on this test, getting less than half the questions (47%) of the questions right, thus failing the test (passing is being in the 67th percentile, I was in the 64th percentile). Many of my classmates were getting better than 95th percentile, so I felt pretty failurific. I just sat there, again, looking at my numbers. Frustrated, angry at myself, hopeless, negative.<br /><br />I carried the black aura around all day. As time passed, the black cloud slowly became a grey fog, until finally it became a clear mist. Being with my friends at the QuizBowl party helped me regain control of myself. It helped me push numbers into the back of my mind, helped me focus more on <b>people</b>. Just talking, just being silly, just giving a few handshakes and exchanging a few grins was enough to get me back on my feet. I'm so grateful to have great friends. Someday, I hope to somehow be able to repay these people for all of the things they have done for me. But for now, I can only prepare for the future.<br /><br />For my bank of knowledge, I must remember that <b>people>numbers</b>.<br /><br /><b>*Random Web News Item of Interest:</b> Skype offers free phone calls to any landline or cell phone in North America with no strings attached, amazing! <a href="http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2006/05/free_calls_to_all_landlines_an.html" title="Skype Free Telephone Calls" target="_blank"><u>Link</u></a><br />
