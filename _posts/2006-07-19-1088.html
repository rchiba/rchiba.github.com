I worked until 9PM today, which was unpleasant, but tolerable due to the fact that Ryan was able to keep me sane. Because of the lateness of work, typing this sentence has become hard. My eyes water from lack of sleep, and the harshness of the lamp light. In my random cyber surfing, I found a neat thing that I feel should be shared.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.babynamewizard.com/namevoyager/lnv0105.html" title="Name Voyager" target="_blank">Name Voyager [LINK]</a><br /><br />I used the java application for a little bit. Apparently, people stopped naming their babies "Pink" after the 1900s, and names such as "Jesus" and "Mohammed" have been on a sharp rise since the 1980s. I typed in "Blue" as a name, and it said that it had no results for babies named "Blue". Why can't humans be named after colors? If people can name their babies "Pink", then why not "Blue", or even "Red"?<br /><br />"Roscoe" was a big hit in the 1890s. Now it's not even in the top 1000 names. I think "Roscoe" is a decent name. I would prefer the name "Roscoe" to "Jesus" any day. But, my personal view on names differs form that of everyone else.
