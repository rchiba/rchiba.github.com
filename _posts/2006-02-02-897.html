I think there is a time to work, and a time to not work. Right now would be a time to work, specifically allocated in my schedule for working, and what am I doing? I'm sitting here typing this, browsing the multitudes of forums that I lurk, checking the news of subcultures and topics I am interested in, and refreshing web browser windows like crazy. My homework sits beside me right now, not finished. The books stagnantly occupy space in my backpack, not being opened for studying. My watch display is changing rapidly. To top it all off, my mind is fritzed from the no-sleep thing I've got going on. My response time is supposedly comparable, or worse than, a drunken git, according to a number of articles I"ve read on the Internet about sleep deprivation. I think that I'll recover once I collapse at school sometime next week.<br /><br />But, surprisingly, I can think coherent thoughts right now even though my sleep has been severely restricted. I still know how to type, still know how to create sentences.<br /><br />This not sleeping thing is working out better than I thought. Maybe I should do it more often. Productivity is limited, but any productivity is better than none, as it is when one is sleeping.<br /><br />I turn my head to the left and realize that my homework is staring me in the face. <br /><br />I turn my head to the right and see the display on my radio show me how late it is.<br /><br />I turn my head up, and realize that I've got to get work done.<br /><br />Leaning back in the chair, I figure out that maybe, instead of typing this out, I should do my homework so I don't fail school.<br /><br />Great. Now that I've written it here, I have to do it. <br /><br />I feel like a slave to my own words.<br /><br />So be it.
