Tomorrow is going to be killer. And it'll be tomorrow in 30 minutes now. <br /><br />Why is it going to be as such? I have deemed tomorrow to be "killer" status mostly because of the tests I'm going to take. Tests have played many different roles in my mind throughout my life. In elementary school, tests were something that didn't need to be payed any attention to. In middle school, tests became more important, but only the ones for core classes, like math. Now that I'm in high school, every test counts, except the health class and speech class tests. My French test tomorrow is especially important, as my high grade in that class is very weak. My French class has almost no homework ever, no in-class assignments either. Although this creates a sense of security that one will never fail a day-to-day assignment, it also causes grades to become very structurally weak. There are so little points that one soiled test will result in a gun to the head of one's GPA.<br /><br />Alas, for this reason, I attempt to study. But, my mind never stops wandering, faltering, getting distracted. I figure that my unfocused consciousness exists because of the little sleep I have gotten this week. I've been clocking in about four to five hours a night. Weekends are no exception. <br /><br />Another thing about lost sleep is that it causes me to be erratic. At times, I can be really zipped up on life, and a few minutes later, I'll be crying on the inside because I've realized that I've done something wrong. Right now, I'm just confused. Studying is difficult when words start to dance on the page. <br /><br />My eyes fail me.<br /><br />And to think, I've still got three more tests to study for. I haven't even studied French thoroughly yet. So, I guess that makes it three and a half more tests to study for.<br /><br />Every night, it's the same routine. This week has gone by so quickly. Partially because the week has felt like one giant day. The little sleep I do get seem like little naps that I'm allowed as a break between work. The things I have to do occupy my mind, fill it to the brim, and so I have no real time to sit down and think, or enjoy life at a standstill. So life just speeds by, and a piece of me dies with every second that passes without being noticed.<br /><br />I wish my life was just one eternal Thursday. On Friday, I know that Monday is coming soon. And the days that follow Friday are just pure torture, to know impending doom is headed my way. Thursday is crazy enough in itself to help me forget about future Mondays.<br /><br />Looking down at my watch, I find that tomorrow is within a few minutes. My tests. My tests.<br /><br />I really feel like collapsing.
