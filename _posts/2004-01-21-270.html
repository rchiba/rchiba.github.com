Hello, this is the Average Yo reporting in with alot to say in a little time. I'm thinking of writing a book called the "Bob Factor" but it is just a thought for now. I am writing this down so I won't forget about it. Anyways, I went to <strong>Barne's and Noble's</strong> book store to get something to study for the ACT's. I really need to start now. I have so much time that I will not have in high school. Another idea I am having is to write down notes from the book (that's always fun!) and publishing them here on a different page. That way, my studies will be choreographed constantly. I really need to get good on it. I only have 2 weeks to study, but that isn't the one that counts. The one that counts is in high school. I forget what year. Anyways, the point is that I can't doddle around all day on the weekends anymore (doddle=surf the net, burn writing utensils, and help my sister on her homework). I need to study.
<br />
<br />Also, Miles Hunley (very creative fellow with yellow short hair, fair skin, and a knack of bragging about his stupidity) and I had a very envigorating conversation. Of course, he was making fun of his stupidity and his large guns that he supposedly owns (All of his information is purely false because he is such a liar) and he started to make fun of everyone else at the table because they didn't have guns and large lawn mowers. All the 3 years of my life, I have been wondering if he does anything useful. After a talk with him, my conclusion was that he had a smaller brain than I reckoned he had. He tried to impersonate me with an INDIAN accent. That is so very sad. My conclusions: Miles Hunley will never make a positive difference to the world; Miles Hunley thinks all Asians look and sound alike;Miles Hunley's brain is saddly distorted my television and caffine;Miles Hunley has terrible school preparation skills;Miles Hunley makes no sense sometimes;Miles Hunley is still at pre-peuberty level;Miles Hunley TRIES(pretty sad isn't is?) to act immature;Miles Hunley will die a lonely and useless man. Those are my conclusions. Consequently, my wanting to move to Amanda's table (completely populated by females) is justified. Now you know why I want to move. All these stupid morons talk about is guns and television. I hope the suffer puncture wounds in the future. That is my lunch table...

<br />Anyways, I wrote all the ideas that I should write about on my palm3Xe so I wouldn't forget them. Actually, I should save them tomorow (i'm running short on time) Well, that's it. Happy Wednesday!
