Yesterday afternoon, I worked the afternoon shift at the pool. The day passed so slowly. For a few minutes, I dozed off on accident, but luckily (and unluckily), my head slipped and my jaw hit my shoulder, slamming my teeth together on my tongue. I still have a sore there from the bite. Needless to say, I woke up pretty quickly and found things to do at the empty pool to keep myself awake.<br /><br />A few minutes later, one of the more experienced pool attendants arrived and handed me a large container labeled "Muriatic Acid". She told me to dump it all in the pool at the end of the day. I look up, and she's gone. I feel a little uneasy, as the jug has a large skull and crossbones symbol on the side, as well as "CORROSIVE" written in bold text. I put the jug on a counter in the pump roomr. I don't think about it until the end of the day.<br /><br />As always, the sun starts to set, and the hands of the clock near the glorious hour of 8PM. My work is about to end. I go to the pump room and look over the checklist. Something bothers me. I look at the checklist again, and see that it says "6. Clean our skimmer baskets". At the end of the day, the skimmer baskets are very disgusting. Smashed bugs of all sorts, spiders, insect body parts, thick mucus of some sort, etc.. Cleaning out the baskets isn't very pleasant. The combined feeling of guilt and fear sinks into me as I open up the first skimmer compartment. <br /><br />Carefully, I am able to pinch the edge of the plastic basket out of the hole. I pull it up and try to ignore the little squirming things inside the basket. Over the fence the basket goes as I try to shake the debris out. As I shake the basket over the fence, the wind blows in my direction. Unsanitary items of all sorts start to fly my way. I look up to see how much debris is left. I notice there is a big clump of hair stuck inside the basket. I try to dislodge the hair by furiously banging the basket against the fence. This doesn't work. I put the basket on the ground and decide to pull the yellow hair out with my fingers. I hesitate, then nervously try to pry the hair out. It stubbornly refuses to come out. After five more minutes of hair picking, I accept defeat and let the clump be. I put the basket back and move on. <br /><br />There are four skimmer baskets in the pool. It takes me about fifteen minutes to finish all of them.<br /><br />I remember something. The acid I'm supposed to put in the pool, that's it. So I go into the pump room and drudge out the scary container. I get to the edge of the pool and try to open the lid. It's one of those "push and twist childlock" lids. It takes me about seven minutes to finally succeed in the seemingly simple task of "pushing" and "twisting", which really means "push, twist, push some more, agonize over, curse profusely, and hit violently with hand". I take off the cap. Another barrier between me and the acid remains. A waxed paper/plastic peel-off covering challenges me. I try to "peel-off" the lid, but I soon figure out that it's sealed tightly. I take to stabbing the lid with my sunglasses. It isn't the best solution, but I manage to poke a few small holes on the top. With that, I begin the pouring.<br /><br />I turn it over and the container starts to slowly drip acid into the pool. I squeeze the sides to get the liquid out faster. The small holes on the top slowly tear to form larger holes. I squeeze the jug harder to get more acid out. <br /><br />Turning my head to look at the acid, I get a deep breath of concentrated acid vapors. I instantly realize my careless mistake in turning my head. My throat, eyes, nose, lungs burn. And they don't stop burning. As I turn my head back to half-fresh air, I recollect learning to waft chemicals in Mr. Mann's eighth grade chemistry class. At that moment, I wished I payed more attention to the safety rules.<br /><br />After a few more excruciating minutes of trying not to inhale more acid vapors, the jug finally runs out. I hastily dispose of the container, and think to myself, "if only I had a cutting tool". That yellow clump of hair could be disposed of, and I could have emptied out the jug many times faster if I had cut the top open with a knife instead of poking it with sunglasses. <br /><br />That was yesterday. Right now is today. Breathing still hurts a little bit, but I think I'll recover. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_R-phrases" title="Annex III of European Union Directive 67/548/EEC" target="_blank">Annex III of European Union Directive 67/548/EEC</a>, the stuff I inhaled is "Irritating to respiratory system". According to the OSHA website, I would need to wear "an air purifying, full-face respirator equipped with acid gas cartridges" to be safe. Oh well, being a pool attendant has its risks.<br /><br />But today, the issue of needing a cutting tool remained. The first thing that came to mind when I tried to think of solutions was my father's large Swiss Army Knife that he keeps in a certain desk drawer. But, I quickly rule that out, as it's bulky and holds sentimental value. So, I did a little bit of research on the Swiss Army Knife (SAK). I found out that they are sold by two companies, Wenger and Victorinox. Recently, Victorinox bought out Wenger, so now they're one company. Wenger products have a Swiss cross surrounded by a rounded square, and Victorinox products have the same Swiss cross, but surrounded with a shield. Apparently, there's also a <a href="http://www.sosakonline.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1" title="Secret Order of Swiss Army Knives" target="_blank">"Secret Order of Swiss Army Knives"</a> which is basically a bunch of SAK fanatics.<br /><br />Anyways, I did a little search and found out that a local Ace Hardware store nearby carried these sorts of knives. <br /><br />After school today, I drove to the nearby Ace Hardware and found the Swiss Army Knives. Having a sort of underlying brand loyalty to Victorinox (My father's knife is Victorinox), I chose to purchase a Victorinox Cadet SAK for twenty dollars. Wearing a black turtle neck and black khakis, I felt a little out of place buying a knife in a hardware store, but no one asked any questions. The employees were very nice in opening the knife cabinet for me, it felt very good to have some service, after being so conditioned to the Wal-Mart style of shopping. And another kudos goes to the cashier who didn't complain when I paid the sum in one dollar bills.<br /><br />So now I have a neat little pocket knife to cut all the hair clumps and Muriatic Acid lids that stand in my way. I do believe this is the same model of Swiss Army Knife that is given to the Swiss Army. Doesn't have as many tools (4 implements), but it's thin and light. Supposedly, the aluminum casing is more durable than the traditional red plastic. <br /><img src="http://img290.imageshack.us/img290/8862/sak4pl.jpg" title="sak cadet" border="0"><br /><br /><br />And now you can enjoy a picture of a fat kid looking at movies in the bargain bin. I was able to snap this picture in a local Wal-Mart last weekend.<br /><img src="http://img290.imageshack.us/img290/731/fatkid6ui.jpg" title="fat kid" border="0">
