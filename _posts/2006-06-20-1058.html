Cleaning the van... Cleaning the van.<br /><br />I spent three hours this afternoon cleaning the van, as it is going to be my designated vehicle. Lysol kitchen disinfectant, spray bottle of water, a roll of paper towels, a vacuum, and a hockey stick. All tools used to fight against eight consecutive years of grime buildup. In the cup holders are layers upon layers of mysterious dried liquids. The floor is riddled with crumbs of all sorts, and the dashboard is dusty enough to dramatically influence the color scheme of the trim. Under the seats are random pieces of trash, an old toy from some kid's meal, eaten in a faraway town. A plastic bag that once held a map. A black zip tie. These things are taken and promptly thrown away.<br /><br />The arm rests are embedded with a fine dirt from hundreds, even thousands, of uses. The coin holder sports a glob of sticky substance. Multiple sprays of Lysol solves the smell issue. The water and paper towels returns the plastic to its original smooth texture. The hose from the vacuum sucks pebbles out of the brake pedal. The carpeting is coming off of the van, the vacuum isn't helping. Swish. The zip tie just got sucked in. Wasn't supposed to do that. I ignore it and continue vacuuming, occasionally stopping to scrub the tan, artificial leather free from eight years of grime and dirt. Layers and layers of filth. I spray until the garage reeks of lemon Lysol. <br /><br />Finally, things are finished. And the vehicle seems as clean as the day it was purchased. Just how I imagined it. Beautiful. The beautiful brown minivan.
