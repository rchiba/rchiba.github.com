Sometimes you figure out that you're a total non-technophile and you feel ashamed but a bit humored. Today was that kind of day.<br /><br />I was browing through the Sunday newspaper (Sunday newspapers are large and fun to read) when I found the local electronics store's ads. I started flipping through these (which is a bad idea since looking at things you don't want to buy, but your really want to on the inside can cause hypertension and depression) and found a ton of camcorders. I thought, "Going to Japan in a few months+pretty pictures of camcorders on ad=in need of video recording device." Then, I decided to dig up an old camcorder deemed broken ages ago. I "booted" it up (can a camcorder "boot"?) and saw that it was still blurry. Originally, it was speculated that this device had a "messed up" CCD and that is why it is constantly blurry. I looked at the eyepiece and found a little line. This little line pointed to another little line. I found that I could rotate the eyepiece to adjust the blurryness of the image in the eyepiece. So, then it hit me. The diopter adjustment thingy was just turned too far. I guess, back ages ago I was about as technologically illiterate as a lay-person. How sad...<br /><br />Kids, the moral of the story is that you should go out and learn about electronics in your spare time! <br /><br />I still hate Ipods. It's a sort of deep, thick hatred. Like a sticky, red, gelatinous substance that just seeps into your inner soul. Yes, I hate Ipods that much.
