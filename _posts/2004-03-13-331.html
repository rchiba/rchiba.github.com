Blog-thing. The meeting went absolutly great! We clicked just like old times! But that's not what i want to tell you. What i want to tell you is the fact that I'm now scared crapless. I spent six bucks, not expecting to get scared over some stupid movie, and here I am, scared and cowering like a child. Oi vey.... i'm never EVER watching another horror film again.....go on, laugh
