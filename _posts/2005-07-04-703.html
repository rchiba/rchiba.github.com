Yep, total renovations for the site. While everyone was out blowing stuff out of the ground and out of the air, I was sitting here, patiently tweaking code. Isn't that a great way to patriotically celebrate America's independence? Maybe? Maybe not?<br /><br />Well, I plan to tweak it some more later. It's looking very plain right now. The menu system couldn't handle my weekly archives, so the archives go by the month now. Yep, I'm up later since I'm active in a forum and I have a drawing obsession right now. More tweaking tomorrow!
