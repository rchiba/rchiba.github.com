Diving has become scary. Thing I fear the most though, is the coach thinking I'm afraid. Yes, I am fearful of fear itself. I almost hit the diving board when I did a back flip, according to Ryan. I seriously don't want to show my fear. I have to mask it. Somehow, I need a way to generate confidence. Generate confidence like Devin generates stalkers and girls. That kind of confidence generation. I may never generate enough confidence to equal Devin's girl generating capacity, but I can try.

<br />Anyways, I lost my Delta Headphones. I really loved them. They cost 2 bucks and lasted me long and true, but today, most likely, they died. Somewhere out in the abyss they are. Waiting to be found. Next time I travel, I'm flying Delta, and I AM going to get some 2$ headphones. I AM.

<br />Also, my English teacher got angry because my printer doesn't work, and she didn't give me any resources off of to write my script with. I don't see how it is fair to be reprimanded for something that... that... is something out of my grasp. I can't use Ryan's printer without alot of time (his floppy drive is dead) and I don't have any other friends who are willing to print for me. I couldn't find any script-writing resources on the internet... UGH. Why do I have to be punished. Why do the people who do the least work, buy the prettiest poster boards, and joke around when presenting get the best grades!? I'm probably going to get a worse grade than everyone else, even though I spent at LEAST 10 hours on planning, thinking, pondering, recording, writing, and debating with myself to put this project together. It's America ain't it? Is that why geniuses die rich, and actors die feverishly, astoundingly, dirty, filthy rich? Does it really make sense? Does it?
