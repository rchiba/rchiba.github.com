The wonderful world of slang is upon us. Popular culture is spitting out new and innovative words in a rate like no other. Slang is often forgotten as time passes, but for a time it becomes the language of the people. The very lifeblood of street communication. Fresh, new words spread through the land in waves. The recent expansion in technology has led to an equal, if not higher, expansion in the development of this proletariat vocabulary.<br /><br />But, all positive events have negative side effects. Slang is no exception. Take my last name for example.<br /><br />According to <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cheeba" title="Urban Dictionary" target="_blank">urbandictionary.com</a>, "Chiba" is:<br /><br /><i><ol><li>how retarded fucks spell the word cheeba. It is one of the better terms used to describe marijuana.</li><br /><br /><li>a portable mp3 player made by rio audio</li><br /> <br /><li>short for "cheap bastard," especially one who flaunts his own wealth while keeping your wages low</li><br /> <br /><li>an abbreviation for "Creating a Harmless Environment to Enjoy Buds Appropriately"</li><br /> <br /><li>a prefecture in Japan, across the Tokyo bay from the capital</li><br /> <br /><li>an ugly girl...one not worth fucking</li></ol></i><br /><br />Who would have known that my last name would be so... colorful? There was never really a large amount of teasing within my group of friends (because my friends aren't insensitive bastards), but when I meet younger, less educated children, the reaction is predictable. I don't mind too much though. It's a great conversation starter, sort of.
