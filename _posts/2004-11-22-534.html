I feel like throwing my books everywhere, overturning my bed, ripping the wallpaper, destroying all of my electronics, screaming insanely, and killing people. Why? I suppose all of these problems either stemie from the fact that I hate my Geometry homework and don't understand it, or because I hate the diving practice that I will have to go to in an hour. It's probably a combination. I hate everything in the world. I feel like torturing innocent woodland creatures, I feel like inflicting damage, pain, and wrath. I want to burn and pillage and destroy. I hate diving and yet I am forcing myself to continue. I hate everyone. Even when I realize my rage is illogical, I am still full of it. Go away, I feel bad.
