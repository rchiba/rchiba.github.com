Devin. Still. Hasn't. Paid. Me. Back. My. Money.<br /><br />He is infuriating me with his constant debt. I'm sure he'll end up in some kind of hobo on the street. A hobo with an electric guitar, but with no power to play it. A pick made out of his loose teeth. Devin, the new-age hobo, will live in Australia. He will try to mingle with the homeless crowd there, best place to be really since all of those Aussies are good natured and logical. They even have a great "unofficial" national anthem!<br /><br />Hobo Devin will scrounge the streets, scavenging for half-eaten kangaroo burgers. Overcomming the stench of old garbage, he will venture to the landfills of Sydney and find shelter with rats and birds. Then, after finding shelter he will start conversing with the birds. He will then form a treaty with them and plan a strategic attack on Sydney Harbor. His plan, involving an old Volvo and a shopping cart, goes awry and he starts sinking into the harbor like a shopping cart tied with electrical tape to an old Volvo, except really. He will drown, but be somehow resurrected after the apockalypse and will find the Earth barren and dry. The dirt, red with Earth's elemental nature dissolving before him, will make him cough. Cough as you may, Devin the Hobo, but you will still owe Ryo $15.30.
