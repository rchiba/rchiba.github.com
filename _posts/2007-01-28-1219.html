Apparently, I aimed my "Maverick Rev-6" a little too far to the right. Almost lost a nerf dart in my closet. I spent the last five minutes of my life looking for this orange nerf dart.<br /><br />Recently, I've been working with a partner on the robotics team's website. I don't know any php, but am planning to learn and use it for the website. I guess I fancy myself as a graphic designer, but all of my stuff is really pretty shoddy. Oh well. I'll work with what I have, with who I've got. It's a team effort, man.<br /><br />Yeah, personal moments have gone away. Do I have a personality? Or am I this shallow, planar object. This emotionless machine, autonomous, idiot who types without reason. Without purpose.<br /><br />Because really, nothing is on my mind at the moment besides tomorrow's homework and the nerf gun in my lap. Am I that clueless?
