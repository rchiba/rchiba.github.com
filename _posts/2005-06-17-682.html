I went to a QuizBowl "movie watching" escapade where we watched this old movie called, "The Sting." It was quite good, but this did not keep me from being socially unacceptable. I was forced to sit in torturous positions as I tried to keep from being eaten by ants. The other reason I was constantly tensioned was the fact that the coach's daughter's little sister kept sitting right in front of my sofa and I had to move my legs up and try to keep my feet from touching her. It was a difficult, truely arduous task. As I struggled to memorize key points of the movie, the lactic acid in my legs started to cause incessant pain to shoot up my leg. I persisted for about thirty more minutes (somehow) and managed to finish the movie. Afterward, the QuizBowl people had a mini-discussion about how everyone should know this one director who produced this movie. To my dismay, I did not know this director. I cringed and tried to divert attention away from myself for the time being. Upon returning home, I started drawing an anthropomorphic rock star (In my signature block-eye style.) I can't believe that I still draw with pencil and paper. It's so hard to draw any way else. Perhaps I should get a scanner. I've heard large corporations and consolidating school systems sell scanners wholesale. <br /><br />I'll look in the newspaper tomorrow. <br /><br />In other news, Father's Day is comming up, turn off your TV and stop watching those darned Father's Day commercials. I hate how these commercials assume that your father has an obsessive interest in power tools and electronics. Such a tarnished reputation fathers have. What? You can just buy him a machine and make him happy? Can you condition fathers like Pavlov's dogs? According to those silly commercials, you can. If you give father a power tool, he becomes happy. It seems like you're appeasing Thor, the thunder god with a peace offering. Silly power tools. <br /><br />Go to the park or something.
