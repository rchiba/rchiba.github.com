I worked on <a href="http://www.hbranimation.com">[hbranimation.com]</a>  for a long time today. CSS is easy, but getting everything right isn't. And getting the page to display right on IE, Firefox, and Opera is terribly hard. Especially since I'm very new to the whole layout-by-CSS concept. Right now, the site is just a template. I'll have time to add content next weekend.<br /><br />At Jefferson, I worked five hours on the actual animation. All scenes are complete-ish. Now,  it's just the credits that have to be done. Then rendering. Then compositing (oh, the joy of compressing your dear child into a pixellated pile of poop.) All this work for a mediocre, 30-second animation.<br /><br />But, I think it's important, this whole being an animator for the robotics team. Certainly,  I wouldn't have learned this much CSS in a day if it wasn't for being on the Animation team.<br /><br />Soon, I will need to come up with newspaper article ideas. The problem is, the things I enjoy reading about aren't what the school wants to read about. It's tough coming up with ideas. I think being busy has eased the pain. You can't feel from a frostbitten hand.<br /><br />Random tidbit: Today, for the first time in a year, I threw a snowball.  The crunch between a  sphere of snow and a road sign is <span style="font-style: italic;">so</span> satisfying.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="http://www.hbranimation.com/"></a>
