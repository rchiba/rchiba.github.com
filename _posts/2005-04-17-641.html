I've been sick all weekend, so pity me. Please. Pity party!<br /><br />Anyways, I've been spending the past few hours drawing Fox McCloud. You know what? These "anthro" drawings really grow on you. "Anthro" refers to a personification applied to animals. My throat feels like a bag of soggy grass and sharp wood chips.
