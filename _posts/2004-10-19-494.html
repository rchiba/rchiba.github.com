My lack of updating has been caused by wi-fi research, price comparing, and intensive deal negotiations. This lack of updating is also caused by the fact that Devin is trying to ignore that my camera is totalled. He just won't speak to me. I understand it "wasn't his fault" and that he doesn't want to take responsibility, but I'm sure we can just work out something if we just talked. I mean, I called him like a million times, and he just won't listen to me. Grr...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I had to miss diving practice and a quizbowl competition in "Indy" (a.k.a. Indianapolis) because of a dentists apointment. I go in and sit down, and the lady checks my teeth for what seems like an eternity. While this seemingly eternal teeth cleaning, I'm staring up at the dentist light that had some name on it. I can't remember what it was. It was like "Procter&Gamble" except there were different names on it. That was what I was thinking of the whole time. If those names on the dentist light were people, those people are now part of history. Their legacy will live on forever. Their names, touching millions of people sitting in bland dentist chairs, looking up at the light, trying to think of something to end the maddening bordom. Those names, that I stupidly forgot.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I got a 3-way headphone splitter, with an amplifier, which is awesome, so now Ryan and I can watch Anime in SURROUND SOUND. And listen to music in AMPLIFICATION MODE. Which totally ROXXORS. I need to publish a book called, "Having a bad day? Cuss in French!". I would buy it. I mean, what better way of telling someone their a hairy, one-eyed, smelly, pig-of-a-idiot, than to say, "borgne, smelly, porc-de-un-idiot"? Porc-de-un-idiot. Such a versatile word.
<br />
<br />What really sums this week up is, KIRBY HYPER MODE.
