Wow, I only ate one meal today. A meal consisting of a meager ration of rice and a few tofu cubes. <br /><br />I'm not exactly hungry. You can't be hungry when you've been working on homework for a five hours. There are some things that you just have to do. You can do without eating for a few weeks. You can't do without mowing the lawn or homework for a few weeks. <br /><br />I'm nodding off and I can't focus. Performance will be affected tomorrow. All in the name of chemistry and integrity. <br /><br />I feel like a dead carcass. I don't care what kind of carcass anymore. Motor control, iffy at best. Can't really remember things. Mind is woozy. Dizzyness ensuing. Hunger strike? More like "Hunger is not on my list of things to pay attention to"-ike. Derr...
