Merry New Year and a Happy Christmahaunikwanzunica to everyone!
<br />
<br />Anyways, this winter break is paining me. I have to sit here for a few more agonizing days contemplating how my winter break "could-have-been" better and stressing over the quickly approaching work days. Days of pain and misery don't feel bad when their constant, but when you're used to joy these days seem disgustingly evil. You see, it's all relative. If my day sucks today, and tomorow sucks, then both of them suck lightly. If today roxxors, and tomorow sucks, then my life is in complete turmoil, I will go bezerk, the earth will stop rotating, volcanos will errupt in New York City, and this blog will get filled with posts. Obviously, if every day was bad, then they wouldn't seem bad at all. Happiness would come in the little things. I have been "happy desensitized". I can no longer feel happy if something little happens. It has to be bigger, better, a million-dollars good. It can't be the little joys, like learning how a humidifier works, or burning a personal CD. It has to really swell to qualify as joyful. Is this winter break all what it is cracked up to be? 
<br />
<br />Well, one thing that I can say is a total loss for myself is my lamp that my mother bought for me today. It's a really nice chrome lamp. I picked out these nice light bulbs that are supposed to last 2 years. Unfortunately, one of them only lasted for about 5 minutes. Now, that got me ANGRY. It was a nice bulb, it SAID it was supposed to last 2 years. Guess what, I hate "Daylight Plus" bulbs now. What's with the "Plus" anyways? I hate it. Stupid "plus". Ruining my day. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to go to sleep now. I'm hoping the break will end soon so I can go back to being miserable. That'll bring back my real self. Work is something you love to hate, and hate to love. It's tearing me apart.
