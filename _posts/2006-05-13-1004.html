I went to the Quizbowl championships, and all was well. Friends make it all better.<br /><br />It's past midnight, and I'm tired, and I don't know what to do. I came home at around 6pm, trudged up to my bedroom, answered three chemistry questions on my packet of questions to do, and then fell asleep. After what seemed like a few minutes of dozing off, I look back at my watch, and it's 10:58pm already.<br /><br />So, I'm sitting here tired and unable to get to sleep. My chemistry, english, band, and French homework is waiting for me upstairs.<br /><br />I'll go do those things now.<br /><br />Actually, I'm a liar. I've decided that I'll suck it up and wait 15 more minutes before going to my room, so I can see what gets posted on woot.com.<br /><br />Then, I'll go do those things.
