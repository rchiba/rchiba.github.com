Surprise storms are not very lovely when they hit at work. The sky above the pool seemed ordinary enough, until a large black splotch started to race toward me. Under it was a large grey curtain that blocked the sun. I underestimated the incoming rain, and was unprepared when the storm hit. In a frantic rush to get things out of the rain, I forgot Ryan's cell phone on the table. Hurriedly, I picked the battery out of the cell phone. I hope that when he tries to turn it on it'll work. I'll feel guilty for a long time if it doesn't.
