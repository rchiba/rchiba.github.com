The funniest thing happened today, according to Zach anyways.<br /><br />My English teacher was introducing our "Totalitarianism Paper" to us. This paper had a selection of dictators we could choose from, including the infamous Kim Jong Il. Because of the school corporation's budget printers, the "Il" in "Kim Jong Il" looked like "II", or a Roman 2. Because of this, the teacher called Kim Jong Il "Kim Jong the Second." I just thought that was the most hilarious thing I've heard in the past month. I suppose English teachers only teach English, but you should at least know who KIM JONG IL is! <br /><br />Anyways, my group consists of Kaiser Andrew, myself, and Russell. Russell didn't want to pick Kim Jong Il (like I wanted too) because it would stir up too much controversey on the Internet. He said that there would be many blogs that would pose too much of a hassle to deal with when we searched the Internet. Absurd. I still think that Kim Jong Il was the better choice.<br /><br />Oh how I remember of old times... Devin, Karl, and I. Those were the days...
