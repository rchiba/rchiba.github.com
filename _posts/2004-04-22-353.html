HAPPY BIRTHDAY RYO!!! May your birthday's be many and joyful! 
<br />Well howdy duty there blog-thing! Miss me? Goood. Because I have so much to tell you....
<br />Not.
<br />All is stupid in the life of me. I'm sick with a dreadful cold (you can hear me sniffling in China...) and I've had a rather uneventful few weeks other than I have finally solved the problem of getting picked on! If it starts to bug me, I'll just think 'I am a weed, and like the special little weed that I am, when people step on me I will spring back up and bite them in the butt!' MWAHAHA! Take that and suck on it Kingma! And you too Simpson! HA HA HA! 
<br />Anyway, not that my little spaz is over, I'd like to conclude by saying; "HAPPY BIRTHDAY RYO! FEEL SpECIAL! FEEL HAPPY! FEEL FREE TO FEEL ANYTHING BUT SAPPY!" 
<br />And that, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, chicas and chicos, mademoiselles and monsiers, was a sappy birthday poem. 
<br />More when my life is more exciting, until next time!
<br />~Amanda
