I went to Ryan's birthday ditty and not many people came, but that just made the whole thing more enjoyable for everyone anyways. Who wants to interact with more than 5 people at a time anyways?<br /><br />On the way there, I had to ride with Ryan's slightly older brother who can drive. It was excruciatingly frustrating. For some reason, the stereotype for teenage drivers held true. He drove fast, dangerously, and loudly. He had complete disregard for the backseat passengers' hearing. For some reason, he couldn't figure out that the speakers were on the back, so politely turning down the volume on already mediocre music would be the most polite thing to do. My teeth were vibrating the whole way, and I didn't like it. I hate teenage drivers. Completely obnoxious.<br /><br />Anyways, I cut my hair, but I don't value vanity, so I'll just not talk about it. Too many commas in the last sentence. Compton is watching.
