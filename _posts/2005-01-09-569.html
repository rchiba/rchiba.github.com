I spend half of saturday trying to figure out what to get with money that I got from my great aunt. It was a 6 hour, ragged Internet bonanza that tested my wits, but I eventually found something worth getting. I got a radio transmitter. Instead of taking the easy route and buying a game, I got an fm transmitter that expands my audio capabilities. I am proud of myself. Other than that, I went to the local botanical gardens. Clegg Gardens to be precise. I tried looking for this place on the Internet, but I was surprised to find nothing. Anyways, I went to the gardens and it was all fun and joy. Now that a REAL work week is looming ahead, I'm nervous. Fortunately, I've decided to take an optimistic stand to the looming goal ahead of me. Unfortunately, this optimistic stand probably won't last very long.

<br />Good night people.
