A distinct, nauseating feeling makes its way up my abdomen, as I slowly open the door to my ultimate doom.<br /><br />I enter French class.<br /><br />As I slowly take my seat in the sea of chairs, I find myself isolated. Groups of two or three chatter mindlessly, as if driven by some higher being to talk, like puppets. I sit there and try to make myself believe that I can succeed. <br /><br />The teacher sits up.<br /><br />Inside, I cringe. On the outside, I sit relaxed, trying to seem nonchalant about the impending doom. I notice that it is raining outside. The rythmic pitter-patter conjures up a beat deep within my primal mind. A war march. A march to death.<br /><br />The feeling comes back.<br /><br />I start to show external signs of my fear. My hands start shaking, my ears start to turn red, my eyes water, my face twitches. Fear swells in me, like it's high tide. I, slowly being washed away, try to withstand the feeling of disaster.<br /><br />Minutes pass, then the bell rings. The tests slowly make their way to my desk. From desk to teacher to peer to desk, I finally encounter the dreadful item. Blood and adrenaline rush through the cords that run through my body, endorphin release rate increases, I perspire. Incomplete thoughts, broken in the pieces by my haphazard thinking fly to and fro through my mind as I work carefully through the problems. I hit a problem I'm unsure on. I have a 50/50 chance of getting the accent on the "e" right. I discover that there are quite a few of these accent problems. I know that their accents are all in the same direction. The only question though, is which direction? I take a shot and guess. I hand my test in.<br /><br />I am the last one to turn the test in. Everyone looks at me like I'm an idiot, inferior to their superior knowledge of French. In a way, I feel the same way about myself. I am inferior.<br /><br />Opening the French book to the index, I find my verbs. I then peruse to the accents. <br /><br />I get the gut feeling.<br /><br />I'm wrong. I calculate my percentage. I am destined to get a "C" or lower. My gut feeling turns to a rampant terror and sadness that runs through my body. I feel a knot develop in my throat, and my eyes start to get red. Blood vessels all over my body begin to dialate. Panic sets in and adrenaline levels reach alarming heights. I try to control myself, because I get the feeling of compression in the head. I get dizzy.<br /><br />The bell rings. It rains.<br /><br />I rush out, and forevermore, my French grade will suffer.
