Hellloooo,
<br />This is me reporting to you, whoever "you" are. Anyways, the math quiz was terrifically easy and so were the ISTEP+s.
<br />Today, I went to the bank and got my 30$ exchanged into 30 gold dollar coins. I find coins easier to organize, store, and keep track of. I have to go to the gym, and i dont want to, but I can't stop the inevitable so I might just give up resisting this endless barrage of tormentive strain. Today, these idiot fag turd-eating pig faced spoiled brats tried to cut. Unfortunately, they succeded which really, really angers me. THAT FAG GAVEN, ok, ok calm down... Anyways, I think that they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I was think... welll goottta go
<br />
