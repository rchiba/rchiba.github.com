Today was a Thursday, and like any other day there was conflict.<br /><br />I was walking down the hallways. They, of course, are congested. One area in the hallway in particular is the most crowded. There is only enough room between the loitering people on the sides for one person. There is human traffic coming in both directions. Because of this, one must stop to let an incoming person get through, and then go through yourself. The inefficient process repeats itself until the school is empty, or the school administration decides to come up with a magical way to solve the school's overcrowding problem. Chiefly, expanding the school. But, that's besides the point.<br /><br />And so while I was waiting for someone from the other side to cross over so I could squeeze in next, there was someone behind me. I heard a aggressive command to "move", and so I turn around. While I turn around, the person whom I assumed issued the command stuck a pencil into my back. I recall he had a very plain white shirt with some sort of logo on it, a generic stranger. And his face was contorted into somewhat of a scowl.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very surprised, but luckily was able to cross through and escape the madness.<br /><br />A few minutes afterwards, I felt really negative and angry. Partially, I was blaming myself for causing an inconvenience to the stranger. On the other side, I was angry at him for poking me. I was waiting my turn to get across, so why shouldn't he as well?<br /><br />After awhile, I tried to forget about it all. And in the end, the whole incident reminded me that there's no point in bothering other people for something that isn't going to change. Doing so has a negative impact on those around us.
