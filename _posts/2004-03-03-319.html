Wow, time flys when your working extremely hard. I've been working on the kingdom project and now I am going to try to rehearse/practice my speech. It is tomorow and I am nervous. 
<br />
<br />Today at school, actually, every day at school, people tell me to "chill out". Whenever some one accuses me or accuses someone, or does something unfair or stupid and I try to teach or show the person or persons my point of view, they just go "chill out". They should be the people who "chill out"! All they do is gossipgossipgossip. THEY should be the D*MN Idiots who should be "chilling out"! Ruining peoples lives with sick trash talk, these people are making my blood boil.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I finally got my hair cut today on the Home Ect. field trip. My hair is alot shorter and now Devin is angry at me. I look like a little kid now, but my mom would be very angry if I didn't cut it. There was this gargantuan ammount of hair because I have been letting it grow for along time. I have a ton to talk about but I don't have time. Tomorow I will type, wait no, I have my speech tomorow so I might not update. I guess on Friday I can type more.
