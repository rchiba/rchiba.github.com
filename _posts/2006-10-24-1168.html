Every night, I spent fifteen minutes combing my hair so it looks just right. I stare into the mirror and make sure all the hairs are pointed in the right direction, with the right intensity sheen, in just the perfect asymmetric way. Picking up the cheap fifty cent comb, I make little adjustments on the left, then on the top. Sometimes it just takes a little twitch of a finger on that one stubborn strand to get everything right. Minutes pass, minutes in which I could be doing something more productive, and finally I reach a conclusion to my journey. My hair is perfect. With a sigh of satisfaction, I walk out of the bathroom, up the stairs, and into my room. <br /><br />Doesn't it seem absurd to you that I do this? I wake up in the morning with hair that's frazzled and odd, and at that hour in the morning I'm too tired to care. <br /><br />So, I'd have to say that I comb my hair at night to relieve stress. To doze off mentally, take a tool, and set out to complete an objective. It's image-building stuff here. So it helps me build my self-image as well. The rationale being that perhaps my hair can make up for my self-implied mental inadequacy. Although, I do  know that somewhere in my head there is the knowledge that I'm not stupid. Maybe Tiffany is right, and I'm just fishing for complements all the time. Or maybe I look down on myself to appear humble. Maybe Andrew is right, and I get sad like everyone else, and getting sad isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />But, there are other things to concern myself with than my own motives in acting the way I do.<br /><br />A service man from Sears came to my house to uncover why the riding mower wasn't starting up. Apparently, four years of neglect and a strict regimen of non-maintenance led to a series of unfortunate mechanical problems. A crack in the plastic gas tank being one of them. Because of the <i>wonderfully clever</i> design of the mower, gas was leaking right into the engine, as the gas tank sits on top of the engine. Also, the battery was fried, and a clogged air filter was leading to major issues under the hood.<br /><br />The service man mentioned that the whole thing could have caught fire if I tried to run the thing with a running battery. <br /><br />Last week, when I noticed that the engine area was oddly coated with residue, I tried to start up the mower anyway. I am grateful that the battery did not kick on. Burnt to a crisp I do not want to be.<br /><br />Off to Canada tomorrow to look at certain canadian colleges. Thinking of higher education scares me. I feel so incapable in this sea of talent.
