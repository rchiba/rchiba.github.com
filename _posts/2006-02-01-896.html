Happy Thursday!<br /><br />I looked at my watch and just realized that it changed to a new day. It's really weird to get no sleep, because one just continues one giant day with the same thing happening twice. Currently, I see white blotches in my eye every once in awhile, and I can't type right very well. I also can't do thinking and whatnot. I think the longest recorded time of not sleeping was 11 days, with no drugs. How difficult. So, one night of lost sleep doesn't hurt, right?<br /><br />The window in my room is a giant sea of black with lots of pretty dots and sometimes I feel like I'm falling even though I'm standing up. And words, I forget what things are called. I stared at my pencil for a few minutes because I forgot what it was called. <br /><br />Humans are versatile, right? So what's a nights really worth in the 21st century?<br /><br />I'm droozy.
