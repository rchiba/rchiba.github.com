Everyone's always estatic about having a half-day.<br /><br />When one doesn't have to take the last two hours of school, what's there not to like? Well, plenty of things.<br /><br />1)Less school work means more homework. From when I got home at 1pm, I worked on homework until 6:30pm. That's a little more than usual, and coming out of my room at 6:30pm isn't exactly "half" my work load.<br /><br />2)Less school work means less points. Less points means that I don't have as much of a chance to boost my sagging grades, like French. If we just had more time, my teacher could have taught us something and assigned us homework. That homework would have boosted my score.<br /><br />3)Less school means that tests become harder. Sometimes, just being in class longer helps me understand certain concepts. Without reinforcement of certain concepts, it's very difficult to recall the small details on tests.<br /><br />4)Less school means lazy kids. What we should have is an occasional "whip these weakling idiots into shape" day where the day is twice is long and we all have to take AP classes. I'm sick of seeing people who can't do middle school level algebra. We need physical punishment to spice up this stagnant educational system.  <br /><br />5)Less school means more work to do in the year, and less time to do it. The teachers have a definite ammount of material to teach, but do not have a definite ammount of time to teach it. Having half days does not help in keeping this material/time ratio constant.<br /><br />6)Less school means I have to write posts like this. I can just feel the hypertension...<br /><br /><br />My proposition? We should have 2x multiplier days, where the day lasts twice as long and we get twice as much material covered. I could even handle a 2.5x multiplier day, to make up for all of those stupid, idiot half days that waste my life.<br /><br />I'm not very fond of half days.
