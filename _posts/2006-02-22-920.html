I look at the watch and I realize that it's already the next day.<br /><br />But, I take to heart my core philosophy, "Life isn't worth living if you're not making one". "Making a living" in the sense of earning money is not what I mean, but I mean the act of doing something. <br /><br />To make a short story even shorter, I started modelling and couldn't stop. Now it's Thursday and I haven't gotten any sleep yet.<br /><br />Not sleeping is supposedly a treatment for depressed people. I think it's working, because I'm too loopy to be angry or sad at anything at the moment.<br /><br />So, I guess not sleeping has its pros as well as its cons. Or perhaps I'm just trying to justify my messed up biological clock.
