This is Ryo...
<br />This morning, I would like to report that it is a 2-hour delay, YAY!
<br />But, that also means more homework, BOO!
<br />Anyways, I installed a counter of how much money has been spent in Iraq.
<br />There isn't much to say except that I have alot of time. Well, can't think of anything, brain overload, bye ;)
