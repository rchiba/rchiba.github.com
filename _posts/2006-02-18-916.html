After all of these years, I've found a freeware program that converts .mov files to any flavor of movie file under the sun. <br /><br />Link: http://www.radgametools.com/bnkmain.htm<br /><br />And to think, I had been using shareware that put watermarks on all converted videos all this time. Now I know that all of my digital imaging devices are interoperable and fully compatible with each other, and my software. For the first time in a long time, success.<br /><br />I'm supposed to give a little speech in front of a crowd of people tomorrow at a local high school about my animation. I have no clue what I'm going to say. To tell you the truth, I don't think there's much at all to say. Basically, they gave me a topic, I came up with a storyboard, animated it, and submitted it.<br /><br />What I'm thinking of doing is just to give the crowd a bit of background of myself, explaining the animation storyboard, and... well, that's all I can think of right now. Because two other animation teams are going to present before me, I believe that they will cover many technical aspects of the animation. Thus, I don't want to plan to explain something that will most likely end up being explained by other people.<br /><br />But, I think life is a matter of making sure that as many people are pleased as possible. Tomorrow, I will show my animation and the robots will be revealed, and the attendees will be pleased. I work hard to please myself and other people, whether that be my schoolwork or working on posting to this website. All around me, people push themselves, to make the world happy. Really, it's not about accomplishing things, because, what's the point of accomplishing anything if it doesn't impact an individual? There is no point. But, that is not usually the problem as any accomplishment usually results in at least one person being pleased.<br /><br />Will I conjure up enjoyment in the crowd tomorrow? Will I even escape alive?<br /><br />Tune in next time for the idiotic self-instigated soap opera of my mundane life.
