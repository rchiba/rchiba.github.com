About two hours ago, I started sneezing. Now I have a headache and I do believe that I am experiencing the beginning stages of the common cold. My sister had a friend over who was sick. I must have caught it from her. This frustrates me, because I hate being sick. And I actually have tasks to perform this summer, so being sick will have consequences on my stress levels.<br /><br />I hear a loud plane flying over my house. To my left, the posters on my wall begin to vibrate a little. Ice water in my plastic cup is making little ripples. It must be an old propeller plane. But, why do they have to fly so low and close to my house? <br /><br />Whenever I hear loud planes overhead, I sometimes get the absurd idea that the plane is carrying a nuclear bomb, and that it will drop, vaporizing me and the world that surrounds me. So, usually I stand there and wonder what it would be like to be instantly vaporized. And other times I wonder what I would do if I had advance notice of my impending doom. What would I say, and to whom? What would I do? What would be my initial reaction? How would I feel? All are valid questions that I ask myself often, most often when loud planes are flying overhead.<br /><br />The fact that I think of these things suggests that I have a fascination with death. And it feels very odd to think about death so often, but it's the apparent impossibility that encases and covers up the blatant possibility that intrigues me. It is very well possible that I could die at any given moment due to a number of circumstances. But, as I type this out, death seems so impossible. And that's how I explain why thinking about death is fun, for me at least. It's fascinating, creative, and scary.<br /><br />The plane is gone, and my mind patters away from thoughts about atom bombs and death.<br /><br />I take a sip of ice water and forget about it all.
