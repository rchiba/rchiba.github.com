Hello blog-thing.... has my life, I wonder, spiraled so low at home? Today at school it was fine, soccer practice is a blast, and yet, the moment I get home, every time, things spiral down. I want out, yet I find myself locked in. Things children shouldn't hear are a commodity. Worries children shouldn't have are on my shoulders. A mindset belonging to an adult is going to be forever trapped in my body, which is lagging behind. I feel as thought my body is that of a child's and my mind that of an adult's. 
<br />Strange, isn't it? So many worries others around me don't even notice take hold of me. I worry about our family budget, I worry about how far into bankruptcy we will fall, I worry about what happens tomorrow; will I find my family dead in puddles of alcohol? Will I find my sister spiraling even further down the wrong path?
<br />I am try, so very hard, screaming even, yet no one, not even Sunny (though she is close) can understand it. It is a feeling I doubt any of my peers will ever know, unless they are older. I look at my school world, I learn, and I grow so much concern. Children, every day, I see them driven closer and closer towards that one edge. The one that so many high school shooting/killings have come from. I see them go into disappear. I see children picking on one another as though they are animals in a hungry fray of flesh and blood. I see the hope vanishing from their eyes, and I can picture the gun, knife, or other instrument of death in their hand, aiming to take another life and get free from this misery. Maybe, some of them will take their own life. 
<br />Is there nothing that can stop others from hurting them? I see girls and guys laughing and taking pleasure in destroying others, and I just want to cry, to scream, and slap them-anything to make it stop. But it doesn't stop, does it? Not even if someone gets hurt. Do these people not know what it is like to be picked on? Do they not think it will hurt? Do they not realize? 
<br />I'm waiting for answers that wont come. Why? Why in the name of everything good can children do this to their fellow peers? Why?
<br />You see, little blog, in this big world I see things. I see so much hurt in my own family, at school, everywhere. You may ask 'how can you smile so brightly then on almost every day?' and I'll answer that now. it is because i KNOW what it is like to want to end it all. I have the scars to prove it and have shed rivers of tears. I know what it is like to be this way. I know suffering, more suffering than most would even begin to believe. 
<br />I have seen good people crumble and break. I have seen children cower, fearing their parents-for I was one of those children. I have seen the damage the wrong path can do to someone. And, I he seen and experienced hate. 
<br />Funny ... so funny, you might think, but it drives me near to tears to think of all I've done and have been through. I've lied for toys and money at a young age, become tainted with the hands of my own biological father, and have forever changed from the once happy little girl I was.
<br />The threats I've heard, the pain I've felt and caused...so much. I wish I could take it away, but I very well can't. In this, I must smile. for, I have been told, a smile can be worth more than anything money can buy or money itself, even if it is to one person.
<br />I pray for all those who are like myself and all those who might become like myself. For I know I am not the first, nor am I the last. And that, is what makes me want to cry the hardest anymore.
