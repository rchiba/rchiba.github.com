To tell you the truth, I'm having trouble thinking again.<br /><br />I suppose it's because of my lack of sleep.<br /><br />This afternoon, I turned in my Chemistry lab, even though I did most of it wrong. I assumed that the teacher wouldn't really catch the little errors that I made. I hope my assumption turns out to be correct, because if it turns out to be incorrect, those hours of pulling my hair out late at night would be in vain. Too bad I turned off the timestamps on these posts, because then you could see how little sleep I'm getting.<br /><br />In other news, I'm obsessed and romanticizing about Starfox and the crew again. <br /><br />Something to put on the "to do list": Make a "Falco Lombardi is my Hero" T-shirt.
