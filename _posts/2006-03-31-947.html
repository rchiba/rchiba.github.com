I've spent the whole day trekking my way through busy airport terminals and the like to eventually get where I am now, in my room. Sitting in my room, the peaceful headquarters for the operations that I so dearly treasure. Operations and tasks such as the kind I am attempting now, typing away. Rather, hacking away at the keyboard. My typing skills have slowed and my once nimble fingers have become clumsy due to lack of computer. <br /><br />Salt Lake City and Moab were rather ace. Four days of hopping rocks in the desert has given me a rather distinguished tan, which I don't really like. <br /><br />But, the disturbing things about the trip were not the events that surrounded it, but instead my thoughts and my mind during the trip. Desperate moral quandary, infatuation, a nagging feeling, a happy feeling, things that I cannot understand. Must be the whole "confused teenager" act that I'm supposed to follow. It makes me want to buy a few composition notebooks and write sad things about my life. <br /><br />I've had these dreams during my vacation. Apparently, I cannot escape that which I try to escape. <br /><br />School.<br /><br />English class in particular. But, all throughout the last few nights, when I was supposed to be sleeping, relaxed, content, I was having nightmares about school. Absurd, really. In these dreams, I would encounter surprise exams about books I haven't read, be prompted to turn in assignments and projects that I had not heard about, forget my locker combination or room number, or receive a failing grade on a major test. In the aftermath of these nightmares, I would wake up in a dazed, cold-sweat trying to find the lost assignment or to remember what my project was. <br /><br />Fear.<br /><br />I try to get away, but my attempts are always futile. Spring break hasn't really given me a "break" so far.
