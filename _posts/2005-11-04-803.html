To relieve myself of stress, I like to look at bloody pictures. Excuse me for my habit. I speculate that it must be all of the gory medical magazines my father has lying around all over the place. Ever since I was a little kid, I've seen bloody, intensely gory pictures of all kinds of "accidents" and diseases. I suppose one could call me "desensitized".<br /><br />Today I went to the local sports bar to meet up with my QuizBowl team. It may just be me, but I think that's the most crazy place to spend a Friday night. Crazy in the fact that we're a QuizBowl team, and crazy in the fact that I'm socially inept and can't deal with so many people. The atmosphere isn't all that great either.<br /><br />The place is basically a big room filled with televisions and projectors that show clips of sporting events. This big room is also filled with chairs, too many people, and lots of smoke. The smoke bothers me, because every time I take a breath in there, I can feel the soot accumulating in my throat and lungs. It irritates my respiratory system, and I don't enjoy that very much. Because of the smoke, I try not to talk as much, and this leads to social exclusion, which leads to a not-so-fantastic team bonding experience. <br /><br />I always feel like an outsider whenever I meet up with people as a "team". I just can't compete with everyone else's intellect and wit, their outgoing personalities, and their plain articulation. It just so happens that I am a stuttering moron. No matter how hard I try, it doesn't matter. I'll always be at the bottom of the social pecking order.<br /><br />And, so, I still don't understand why I still attend these occasions, besides needing to satisfy my thirst for being "part of something".<br /><br />I suppose I'm being selfish, and, in the long run, am being punished for it. <br /><br />It doesn't really matter to me now, because I'll have to think about it later. I'm too busy trying to finish my homework.
