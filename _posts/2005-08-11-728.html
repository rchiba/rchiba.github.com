I'm starting to transmorglify from a timid noob "SL'er" or "Second Lifer" to a hardcore online community geek. Just fantastic. If I follow the footsteps of the lineage of Everquest users, then my future is doomed. This game will overrun my life and I will slowly sink into the depths of obesity and nutrition deprivation. Eventually, I will become delusional and the line between fantasy world and real life will start to fade away. In the end, I will kill myself after losing a not-really-so-rare item and my parents won't want to blame themselves so they'll blame it on the game. The media will bounce the story hard and I will become just another statistic, another reason for Mr. Thompson to fight harder. Well, isn't that spectacularly cliche?<br /><br />Basically, today was a mix of both worlds. While I spent time with my friend today, I also did a lot of online socializing. I went to some cyberspace parties with my furry fandom friends and partied for awhile. I made quite a few friends. Then, I decided to buy a vehicle, so I went comparison shopping. After a few recommendations, I was sent to R&M Engineering, where they built me a hovercraft, their most basic model. I was soon well into the atmosphere, driving around my neat, little aircraft. Later, I picked up some stranger and went flying around. I dropped her off at her workplace and was invited to some party. Unlike in real life, I went to the party.<br /><br />Well, Second Life is so eventful, it really can seem plausible that some people can lose grasp on reality and kill themselves. This whole universe really is like a "metaverse", a digital, cyberspace world with physics, rules, and housing complexes. I wished for it when I read Snow Crash, and now I've got it. Absolutely smashing! Wacco! Wizard!
