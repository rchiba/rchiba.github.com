The line is short. Two people long. And there are two of them. Behind a desk are two artists. The large poster behind them informs me that they produce artwork for <a href="www.neopets.com" target="_blank">Neopets</a>. The pretty pictures of make-believe animals entice me to get in line. The poster also tells me that the artists will draw me a free sketch of my favorite neopet. <br /><br />Years ago I was obsessed with neopets, neopets art, neopets McDonalds toys, I even had a few neopets trading cards. In time, this obsession faded away. I was no longer chained to the giant, capitalistic venture meant to capture and brainwash the minds of children. But, the fond memories of playing flash mini-games to get more neopoints, buying magical potions and foods to feed to my neopet, trying to find rare items to sell, these memories never disappeared completely.<br /><br />The person in the front of the line has walked away with his completed sketch. I take a quick glance at it and see the beauty and cuteness of his neopet. Only one person in front of me. At the front of the other line is Ryan. For his picture, he's getting a Krawk, done in red colored pencil. I figure he'll be finished before the artist even gets to me. I start hoping for the man in front of me to get done quickly.<br /><br />A few minutes fast, and simultaneously, Ryan's Krawk and the man in front of me is finished. I step up to the desk, and the lady looks up at me. The poster says her name is "Story". So, I tell her what I've wanted to tell her for the past fifteen minutes.<br /><br /><i>"I'd like a Pteri, please. Done in red. Thank you so much."</i><br /><br />She starts drawing. Her smooth hands draw equally smooth curves that slowly meld together to form a circular body. Then, a circular head is drawn. The tip of the red colored pencil zips around the page, making quick nicks and long broad strokes. A head is drawn. Then a tail, then the wings. Minutes pass, and the details, the feathers on the wings and the reflection in the eyes, slowly come to shape. Finally, a finished Pteri is drawn. She signs her name in the corner of the paper and asks,<br /><br /><i>"Would you like your name on it?"<br /><br />"Nope. Thank you so much though. I really appreciate it."</i><br /><br />I walk away in awe and amazement at the art. Real life neopets art. In my hand. On a real sheet of paper, drawn by a real neopets artist, with a real red colored pencil. <br /><br />Ryan and I carefully secure our sketches in our bags. To the next booth, forward to new excitement.<br /><br />I went to a comic/anime/video games/dungeons & dragons convention in Chicago today. It was called <a href="http://www.wizarduniverse.com/conventions/chicago.cfm" title="Wizard World Chicago, home of the ice cream llama" target="_blank">Wizard World</a>. Lots of excitement, lots of walking, lots of tiredness, lots of pseudo-valuable Marvel and DC merchandise, lots of adult hobbyists trying to barter for pseudo-valuable Marvel and DC merchandise. I'll post photos soon. I got my picture taken with Pikachu, and with the Red Power Ranger too. <br /><br />
