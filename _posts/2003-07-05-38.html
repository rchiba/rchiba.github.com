It is me again, 
<br />It was a very dreary and dark morning indeed today, but that soon passed. Now it is bright and sunny with a nice breeze(like everyday). I saw the city fireworks display last night. It was amazing. Truly spectacular. A great spectacle indeed. I took many a good picture and movie also. It was great. Unfortunately, that is why I couldnt write in my onling journal last night. Oh well... it was worth seeing the awesome fireworks. They were huge and very loud. The city shot 4 cannons too. Those were even louder. Well, it was a great night last night and I enjoyed it, I hope you went somewhere to see fireworks too...
<br />TATA;)
