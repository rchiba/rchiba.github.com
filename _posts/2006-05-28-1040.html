I got new window curtains today. The paint on my old wooden blinds has been chipping for awhile, and it started to go bad (the wood), so I rigged a pole up and put curtains on it. It's nice, but they're a little more transparent than I want them to be. I don't have anything to hide, but looking at the outside world bothers me when I'm trying to keep things simple around me. It seems that when I'm agitated, complexity frustrates me. Sometimes, the outside world is just more stress to put up with.<br /><br />But, I won't have to deal with that for a few months, since the summer months usually don't involve as many stressing moments.
