The average yo here.
<br />My life isn't as turbulent as Amanda's so I won't have as good a post. Anyways, I watched the world reknowned "Apockalypse Now" on dvd. It's almost as high ranked as the "Godfather". "Apockalypse Now" is really old (my dad watched it when he was a kid) but it is color and has pretty extensive special effects. It's about the Vietnam War and it's tragic consequenses on the human minds that participated. It's a sad story really. Anyways, today was nothing new.
<br />
<br />Guess what? I get to go take a tour of Harrison High School on tuesday. I am excited. I am afraid too. This sounds extremely stupid and trivial next to Amanda's post, but I just want to say that my anticipation is taking advantage of me. I finally got a 4 year old laptop to work and I am typing it on now. I've been trying to fix the internet on it for years and it works spastically now. It used to work for around 30 seconds and then stopped transferring information. Anyways, I spend an hour formatting 30 old macintosh floppy disks. Now they are all in windows format and I can use them for data transfer. I want to write a story, but I just can't. I should do something. With the flourecent light and lcd screen burning my eyes, I feel my worthlessness.
<br />
<br />Anyways, now I can update my website in the safe loft of my room. I got WASK-"cool oldies" radio station playing right next to me, a 10 year old flourecent light shining in my face, and an obsolete laptop blaring in my eyes. All this is taking place in the dark corner of my room. Just to give you a mental picture. Anyways, as the sun sets, my worthlessness increases. I have to fix the speech. I don't know how though. If I don't this weekend, I might as well throw it away.
<br />
<br />In Advanced English we have to do this HUGE thing on the Hobbit. I guess I'll have to re read a book that I read when I was in fourth grade. We also have to make up our own "Fairy Tale land". This is going to be extremely hard for me because I am extremely uncreative/unartistic/untallented/unspellerific. Anyways, the future integrity of my mind is in stake. I need to condition myself to stress. The Klondike Nerds are coming for me. Help me....
