I am back...
<br />And here I am...
<br />back from school...
<br />Well, today went along pretty fine. I got to meet new teachers and everything. No worst case scenarios here. Anyways, our friend Justin decided to quit. I respect his decision because being the webmaster of a site can be a daunting challenge. Although, I think he could of stuck with it if he put in more effort. Oh well... Anyways, about school. It is very fast and I am still confused on whos who and wheres where. I hope I dont get lost or get stuck in a tetris situation. It seems that my friends are not my friends anymore. My friend Ryan seems to be getting farther and farther away from me. I feel like I am alone, like everyone is connected except me. Like... Everyone has electric scooters and paintball partays, extravagant games, and a worryless life, but me. Its all them who get all the moolah and plenty of time. For me time is of the essence. For as time ticks away, so does life. Even as I type these words and as you read......
