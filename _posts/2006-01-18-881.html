Wednesday, the middle day. Some even call it by the name of "hump day".<br /><br />I think of it as "Chemistry homework is burning gaping holes in my corneas" day.<br /><br />For now, the gaping holes are slowly repairing themselves. I've finished what I've got to have finished, but I don't have time to work ahead like I would like to. At the moment, I'm typing up a speech, and am getting ready to go downstairs to turn on the network printer so I can print out all my junk.<br /><br />The hard drive came today. Pretty routine installation. But, I realized that I only have one SATA cable, but now have two hard drives. It was truely a "Doh!" moment for me. So, I'm planning to go out and get a cable sometime this week. Not that it would matter. I'm so overwhelmed with homework and other school-related things that I hardly have time to even touch the big computer downstairs.<br /><br />But, to tell you the truth, I touched my big computer downstairs a lot today. I wonder how many people just read that and thought... never mind.<br /><br />Today, I took the desktop to school so Alex could install 3dsMax on it. Hopefully, he'll send me a key to the program soon. I also hope that someday I'll have the time to work on the animation. But then again, being the only one really "into" the animation, I've got the added responsibility to "make time". If that means staying up until midnight (like I am going to have to tonight), then so be it. I'm willing to suffer to better the team.<br /><br />Bah. My mind is suffering. I can't even remember what I learned in French today. It should be noted that I failed another of the pop French quizzes that happen to come up every once in awhile. Those things always shred me, in terms of my grade. Because there is never any homework in French, I'm probably failing the class due to that quiz. The whole "boo-hoo, woe is me" schpeel is getting too old. I guess I'm becoming desensitized to my abysmal French grades. Eventually, I'll end up being some failure that lives on the streets in a tattered nightgown.<br /><br />It'll be midnight in a few more minutes. Then, I'll start thinking of sleeping. I can't let myself think of sleep or else I'll get tired. Work, work, work.
