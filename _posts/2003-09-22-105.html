Back to another week of school,
<br />It is 20 minuites untill the school bus comes and takes me away. I downloaded this really cool music syntesizer called visual music. Its free and fun, you should check it out. Its rainy today so I am afraid that I will get my tape recorder wet. I'll have to take the risk, in the name of the "School Intelligence Agency"!!
