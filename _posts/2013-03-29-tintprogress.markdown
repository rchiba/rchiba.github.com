There is something about this graph that captures how small we started, how hard we've fought, and what we dream of doing. There is something about this graph that makes me want to shake my fist at the sky and say, "Take that!". It makes me smile and hope for good things in the future.

Tim and I put together the timeline below for the sake of history. Whatever happens from now on, at least we had our moment of progress. The second time around, we beat our personal record a hundered fold. Here's to a victory curve.
