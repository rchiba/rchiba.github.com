I've gotten my hands on a neat graphing calculator. I instinctivly hate Texas Instruments because of my hardcore Casio loyalty, but hey, Casio isn't standard is it?<br /><br />Well, I haven't got the time to mess with it much yet. I've basically gone along with the fantastic 209 page manual. <br /><br />The manual is a blessing in itself. I've always fancied myself reading manuals. This will make for great reading. I'm already on page 15 or so. I can't wait until I get to the good parts. And I'm totally serious about this. I enjoy manuals and tutorials, so I suppose I can merit them "hobby" status. I've got a stack of manuals in a hidden drawer in my desk so I can read them if I get bored. It's great stuff.<br /><br />Well, the worst thing is that I had no time to tinker with my new pride and joy. I spent all of my afternoon on my "Milk, Dye, and Detergent Interaction Lab" for chemistry. That and buying my calculator. <br /><br />If I could buy a "Furry Pride" shirt, I would. I can't find any. That's why I should sell them.<br /><br />I put some new links up for webcomics and whatnot. I really like "Bad Rabbit." The creator's style is just fantastic. I've been using her stuff for refrence art for a few days now. <br /><br />Check it out. Or check yourself out. Or check that hot girl behind you out. Oh yes, you tell me that you're some pathetic, blog obsessed, socially inept, visually handicapped loser that doesn't have a hot girl behind you? Well, we're in the same boat.
