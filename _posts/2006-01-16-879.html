My schedule has been driving me up a wall, so to speak.<br /><br />This afternoon, I hurriedly walk toward the cafeteria after gathering my large stack of books. Upon entering the cafeteria, I quickly find my seat, sit down, and open my Chemistry book. A pang of hunger hits me. Unfortunately, I had started to eat lunch again over the weekend. Thus, I was not as conditioned to non-lunch-eating as I was before this weekend. To satisfy my primal urge for food, I put down my books and adventured to the lunch line. <br /><br />After waiting approximately 15 minutes in line, I realize that the end is near. Taking a tray and a fork, I ask the person serving the food for a bowl of pasta. She says there is none. I look down into the stainless steel containers and realize that there is indeed no more food left. <br /><br />After a moment, I think to myself, "Just a salad. Not that bad. Could be worse..."<br /><br />I take a few more steps forward to find the bin where they store salads empty. There is no yogurt either. <br /><br />Empty.<br /><br />Except for the lone bottle of water in the corner of the bin. <br /><br />Figuring that I can stave off my hunger by drinking the water and pretending to eat food, I buy the sixty cent bottle of water. I put the bottle of water on my tray, next to the now obsolete fork, and walk back to my seat. The water helps me feel better, but the fact that I am locked into a position where I cannot get food even if I wanted to bothers me. <br /><br />The window of opportunity is nonexistent for me now. This afternoon, my hopes and dreams of having a real lunch were shattered, ground into a million pieces, incinerated, and put in concrete containers buried deep beneath the surface of Yucca Mountain.<br /><br />So there's my day for you. Full of angst, just like I like it.
