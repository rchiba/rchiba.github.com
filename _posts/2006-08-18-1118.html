Refreshing my email over and over...<br /><br />It's like seeing if it's Christmas Day yet. Glancing at the alarm clock beside the bed over and over...<br /><br />I don't know why I'm up so late. I've got to get to sleep and stop dashing my sleep schedule to pieces. It'll take me through Tuesday to reset now. I'm not too enthusiastic about that. Good night.
