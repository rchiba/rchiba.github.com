Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.<br /><br />The pressures of life melt away during sleep deprivation mode. All the things that have been plaguing my mind, distorting my emotions, destroying my self-esteem, all of those things have ceased to exist for this very short moment. <br /><br />And the most wonderful thing about it is that I know that I can sleep in three periods at school tomorrow. French, Health, and Lunch are open periods in which I can sleep. Sleep feels better at school anyways. Why sleep when you have access to a kickin' computer and the Internet? <br /><br />For the longest time, I was a purist about sleep and getting enough of it. Now I've come to see that sleep can be brushed off the schedule, and things still get done. The world doesn't come to a crashing halt. My organs don't shrivel up and die. All throughout life, health educators have inferred to children that the "recommended" daily amount of sleep is actually the "required" daily amount of sleep. At least, that's how I felt when those silly health teachers lectured about things involving sleep.<br /><br />For me, less sleep results in more work getting done, more recreational time, less stress, a better mindset, and being more up-to-date on tech news. Side effects are drowsyness, occasional vomiting, and dry eyes. Lack of sleep sounds to me like just another anti-depressant. Except I don't need the FDA's express approval to apply this solution.<br /><br />There will be a day when sleep is obsolete.
