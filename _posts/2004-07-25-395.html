Average Yo reporting.
<br />
<br />I learned how to rip songs off of internet radio stations. No more idiotic kazaa. I never liked it. Now I can rip a entire genre of songs by pressing a button and walking away. Quite convenient if you ask me. Anyways, now I have lots of DDR, classical, 80's pop rock, and other genres of music on my ipaq. I'm learning new things about my ipaq every day. I've almost maxxed out my 1gb card though. I'm a data hog. He he he...
<br />
<br />Anyways, inside me I feel a subtle feeling of impending doom. It's like I know the walls around me are going to collapse on me any second. Of course, I get this feeling around this time of year. It's just my mind's rationalization of high school. Yes, fear is that powerful. Anyways, I try to control it by making myself understand that high school won't be a killer. And yet, that fear still runs rampant through my head. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I constantly look back now to my Optimist's Club Speech Contest. It's helped me in so many ways. Stress diversion, etc. It's like... an unbelievebly good effect on my life. I'm positive. I'm not afraid of speeches. But this invincibilty can't last long. And with the feeling of impending doom in my head, I get more insecure. But what am I insecure about? Not my dignity, that's for sure. I lost it last year when I danced in front of my school in a cow costume for the talent show. Maybe I'm insecure about... I have no clue.

<br />Oh yea, in other news, I got Sim City 2000 to work on my ipaq. W00t!
