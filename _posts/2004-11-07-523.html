Linux configurations, hardware drivers, new computer building specifications, RAMs, CPUs, PCMIAs, PSs, and the like are keeping me from updating. It's so frustrating, but I enjoy learning about computers. I've come to occupy the "computer nerd" niche, I guess. I plan to build my first computer soon. Earlier, I have installed Fedora Core (a form of Red Hat Linux) on the crabby beige computer. It has been trying to resist, but I have forced it to work. Luckily, I have not had to mess with the BIOS. For those of you who don't know (or care) about what I'm saying, keep reading.

<br />At school, I get loaded up on homework, upon which I go to diving, and come home at six thirty, upon which I cram and try to get my homework done and ... I have to sleep. Updating will hopefully resume tomorow.
