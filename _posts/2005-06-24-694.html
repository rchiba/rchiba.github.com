For now, my posts are stuck down here because of a blogger malfunction (I think), but hopefully it'll resolve itself since I emailed them for help. They can't refuse a plea for help from someone as pitiful as myself. <br /><br />I was mowing the lawn on a lawn tractor in the dark an hour or two ago. <br /><br />Cutting to the chase, I strap on my earmuffs to block the jarring noise of the 18 hp kohler engine that my lawn tractor runs on. I suddenly am hit by a nonsense idea. Rushing up the stairs, I retrieve my sister's half-dysfunctional, uncomfortable headphones. I strap them on and then put on my earmuffs. Once those are in place, I cover it all with my trusty NASA hat. I'm ready as I'll ever be. I start heading toward the garage. <br /><br />Carefully checking for obstacles as I push my mower out, I find a hose. I think to myself, "Not again." With luck, I find myself avoiding the dark green, grass-covered hose successfully. I sit myself on top of the poorly built, vynil seat. It smells funky today.<br /><br />As the sun sets for this muggy, summer day, I push the clutch pedal, carefully adjust throttle, and turn the key. The engine roars to life as I suddenly realize that I've made a terrible mistake. The headphones jut out at the perfect angle to disrupt my earmuff's noise buffering ability. I'm going to have to suffer from the incessant noise of the mower. How unfortunate.<br /><br />You know, just as a side note, if I happened to die and saw myself in a third-person view, I would say, "How unfortunate" in a nonchalant manner. Just goes to show you how much I value life. Like you care about my values anyways. This society is so shallow, if you don't have the same values as someone else, you become an automatic enemy. Can't people compromise?<br /><br />Anyways, I cruise through the young night with my mower, listening to indie rock in one ear and the annoying rumbling of the engine in the other. I find myself bobbing my head up and down in the musty, dusty air. The night is not cool yet, the heat is just starting to subside. It's still muggy. So muggy, in fact, that you just might think that you could quench your thirst by breathing. I can't even see the grass any more. I find myself estimating and approximating my path of travel so I cut uncut grass. Later, I find my estimation has gone horridly wrong, but I'm not sure of my observation since I still can't see the grass. I continue to cruise along, feeling the wind in my hair. I continue to enjoy my "freedom", but it really isn't freedom since I'm restricted to the lawn. Superficial freedoms are better than none, I suppose. It's getting late, so I pull into the garage. My dog is sleeping. I feel wet from the humid air. Grass particles cover every square inch of my body. Game over, I take a shower and get up to my room where I type a stupid little ditty on my lawn mowing experience. And here I am.<br /><br />Like you care about my lawn adventures anyways.
