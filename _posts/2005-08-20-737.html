Lack of sleep makes me loony.<br /><br />When become loony, I want to read webcomics. My voracious webcomic appetite keeps me from going to sleep, and thus, my loonyness exponentially increases, eventually terminating in complete shutdown. Comics and gags are so much funny when you're half-awake and in a dark room. I find that to be true. I can't play the clarinet worth feces, and it's making me loony too. I'm having a loony weekend. Loony all the way to the bank.
