Oh, Kimmy. You never cease to amaze me.<br /><br />I'm talking about <a href="http://www.komando.com/" target="_blank">Kim Komando</a>, a technology writer that appears every week in the local newspaper. Today, she decided to answer questions about how to clear a web browser's cache, fix a virus, and/or what a "control panel" actually is. The horrible thing about it is that she's being doing this, answering exceedingly simple and similar questions, for the past few years. The fact that people <i>still</i> don't understand what the control panel is casts a shadow of doubt over the advancement of society. <br /><br />The "Technology" page of the newspaper comes out Monday, and its always full of mindless, stale, idiotic tech news. Sometimes, actually most of the times, I feel like the editors of the newspapers and the wire writers meant the text to be read by monkeys. This Monday, one of the largest columns was about a new <i><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1764543&page=1&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312" target="_blank">"Desperate Housewives"</a></i> computer game. On the side of the paper, it mentions a webpage that lets one browse through the Bible, and in end different languages. Obviously for the monumental amounts of people who enjoy reading the Bible in <b>ten languages</b>.  <br /><br />And to add <a href="http://www.mercola.com/images/newsletter/2005/07/05/steve_jobs.jpg" target="_blank">ugly</a> to injury, Steve Jobs is present in a large image that is in the center of the whole web of monkey stool sample. How much longer will "we", as a society and species, have to cater to iPod-addicted, Steve-worshiping, Shallowtelevisionshow-watching, Bible-reading morons?<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I'm beginning to think that it will be a long time before the Tech page in the newspaper cleans up, if ever.<br /><br />Giving up on the newspaper, I've spent about 3 hours drawing something up. Tomorrow is a half day, which is a prime opportunity to knock out some more drawing while I'm at it. Hopefully, homework will be minimal over the course of the week. I'm just getting settled in.<br /><br />Settled in to <strike>a living hell</strike> school.<br /><br />
