A major date is today. The first day without diving associated scenarios. Wewt!<br /><br />Anyways, today I went to an awards ceremony that was organized by the Harrison High School booster club. I found it very much a waste of time and overall had a negative image of it in my mind. I received a certificate (A purposeless piece of paper) which was the actual "award".<br /><br />The whole ceremony started off with this astronaut called Guy (I forgot his last name.) Guy talked and showed us a DVD about how he wastes his time in space by playing with his food. He told us that space travel was "exciting, fun, meaningful, and awesome". I have no idea how space travel had to do with my high GPA. After his schpeel, Kara, Maria, and I lined up for the handing out of the awards. <br /><br />Actually, we had to write an introduction that the announcer would read before hand. As they read mine, I was feeling nonchalant. After I sat back into my chair, I listened to other people's introductions. Slowly, I became aware that everyone else had a more witty, meaningful, and professional introduction than me. I started to feel guilt and shame. True shame. True shame that eats at your self-esteem. As I basked in my self-hate, I tried to stay awake. First, I stared at a wooden panel in front of me and tried to memorize it's wood grain. That got boring after awhile, so then I started playing with the light reflections that came from my watch. After that got boring, I started..... Then the ceremony ended. Finally...<br /><br />After the ceremony, I promptly left. I was not going to bask in my low self-esteem any longer. <br /><br />And.... That's what happened today. I've been corresponding with Greg, my diving coach via email. My scattered jumble of DVD's needs organization. I need some kind of racking device. <br /><br />Also, I would like to announce that I HAVE DISCOVERED THE 1337NESS OF "AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE"! WEWT!
