It is monday and if you are wondering how I am typing this, it is because my school is having a 2-hour delay. I am so happy, NOT! This means that I am going to have to finish the same ammount of homework in a lower ammount of time. Consequently, my homework:time ratio will be disturbed and my mental status trashed. I can't believe people like 2-hour delays. And when I say I do (I don't complain, it's just me explaining my differing oppinions) and explain my reasons (which are better than everyone elses) they laugh and say that I am a nerd and that I am the only one who wants to go to school. These people are like pigs (not physically, but mentally) their happy when they get sludge and eat it up. Then they never notice that they are going to be butchered in the long run. The don't go to school, do stupid things (happily by the way) and then complain when they get to school that they actually HAVE to go to school. I think all those stupid monkeys who don't want to go to school shouldn't. It would cut taxes, and people like me could get more leadway into society. Monkeys should stay if they don't want to go to school, while I go to school and appreciate that I am actually learning and doing SOMETHING and.... ARGHHHH I get angry when People don't realize what is ahead and just sit there... Waiting for the train to decapitate them... Muahhahah....

<br />I finished 4 movies total over the weekend. I made 2 black and white old fashoned movies, one weird one about a guy named Bob, and a realistic one about me as a private investigator. If you want to see them, just email me and I will email them to you. You need Windows Media Player to play it( they are .wma files). Anyways, they are a bit humerous, and stupid.

<br />When I type, time goes by so quickly. I have to go to school soon. Unbelievebly, it snowed like 2 inches last night. I can't believe the school decided to have a 2 hour delay. What's the point of recallibrating the system only to be turned on 2 STINKING hours later. Just make all the kids go to school at the normal time. Wow, 2 inches of snow and -10 degrees isn't going to hurt no body. 10 minuites till school.

<br />SHOOT, I have to remind ryan to bring our poster. If he forgets, I shall erupt upon him that no man or child has ever immagined before. I better call him. Our corellation reminds me of symbyosis. I am sadly tied to his fate as well...

<br />Anyways, when spring comes, I am going to revamp the site. Next weekend, I am going to be buisy and all that stuff. Spring will sprout up tons of unneeded school projects and I shall not have enough time to have fun making movies. I have decreased my TV watching by 95%! I only watch 20 minuites of TV each day, indirectly! Now I spend most of my time on the computer typing things like this. You know, I hate the children at school who's minds are so pliable, they sway in any direction they are reared in, and never think twice. They watch the news, the believe it. They read a book, they believe it, they read a website article, they believe it. They DON'T understand that most things on medias like these are truly FALSATE and are being guided by people with money. Sadness for all envelopes this nation. Wah Wah Wah...

<br />Well, the bus is coming so Bye...
