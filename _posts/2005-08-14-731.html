Once you get involved with a virtual community too much, reality becomes distorted. The reality distortion phase is starting to come on. As I was heading toward Indianapolis today, I looked out of the window. I looked at the road signs, the stripes on the road, the other cars, billboards. I became to break each little thing into a set of primitives, or primitive shapes used in computer assisted design. I thought of ways to use textures to create the realism. Light settings to emphasis metal parts. Position and rotation parameters that had to be set. Joints that had to be programmed in, and scripts to be contained within each object to govern it's behavior. <br /><br />Then it hit me. This is the real world. A real highway. The stuff on the sign is ink, not a texture that's been uploaded to some server. The light settings on that chrome trim is correct because there really is light that's bouncing off of that chrome. The road is moving smoothly, not because I have a fast computer and a nice graphics card, but because my eyes can see. I can't jump out of the car and fly away. I could die at any time. A crash doesn't result in a BSOD. In reality, it results in death and fire. Scripts and physics engines don't govern time, space, and gravity. Time, space, and gravity govern themselves.<br /><br />The line between my second life and my first is starting to blur. And it's facinating.
