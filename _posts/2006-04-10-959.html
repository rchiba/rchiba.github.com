Accomplishment. Something so very relative.<br /><br />I have spent the past 3 or 4 hours creating the first second for the <a href="http://www.10secondclub.net/" target="_blank">Ten Second Club animation contest</a>. Like the name suggests, this monthly animation competition involves animating a given ten second audio clip. For the longest time, I've wanted to participate in this competition with the many great animators that take part in this great activity. Last month, I reviewed all of the 50 or so animations that were entered into the competition. The main reason I took the enormous time and effort to judge these was to get an idea of what kinds of things other people are doing when it comes to character animation. I also did it to contribute to the Ten Second Club community. I enjoy browsing through their forums and job listings. For me, it's exciting to see that this hobby could actually result in cash and perhaps a career. By no means am I of that level of animator, but like I mentioned before, I completed the first second for the ten seconds I hope to complete this month. <br /><br />The first second consists of three words, "Are you ok?". I put all the previous reading on character animation to good use, by first setting up the few poses that I wanted for this short animation (It's amazing how many poses you need in just one second), and then refining the movements by increments of five frames or so. Since there are thirty frames in a second (technically, there are 29), there was much work involved. Then came the lip synching, which is actually much more than moving the mouth. It's a large task to convey emotion through a face, but I sketched the mouth and face keyframes out on a scrap piece of paper, and then used the paper to enter in keyframes for the face. Then, for about an hour, I touched up. <br /><br />Details, details, details. The power is in the details.<br /><br />And so I changed a facial expression ever so slightly, moved the lip a little bit higher, made the arm swing just a smidgen bit more lefterly, and made the body lean an inkling more pronounced. <br /><br />Then I save (I really should have saved more than once, but hey, I live life on the edge),  and hit the "Animate" button. The computer works its magic, and I get a one second animation that looks pretty darned life-like. I add the voicetrack, and I'm amazed at how I gave life to a previous lifeless character. It's truly an astonishing, astounding feeling to make something out of nothing.<br /><br />My sister walks up behind me and watches me as I mindlessly stare and admire my looping 1 second animation of a character saying "Are you ok?". (Ironic, isn't it?) I ask her what she thinks of the lip synch and life-likeness of the character, and she says that its "alive and that's all there is to it." This in itself is rather amazing, as my sister enjoys mocking all of my creations. <br /><br />And so tomorrow, I hope to create the second second. Hopefully, it'll be even better than the first one.<br /><br />*Note: I'll post a link to a video clip showing the one second animation I speak of when it gets approved by Google Video.
