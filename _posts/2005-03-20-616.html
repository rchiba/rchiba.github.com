I have to admit. I'm a brand loyalist. I admire UPS and DHL while I hate FedEx. <br /><br />I hate FedEx because:<br />1. Their shipment time is mediocre.<br />2. Their promises are never kept.<br />3. They use green and purple on their trucks.<br />4. They don't make entertaining commercials.<br />5. They crash their planes into islands and have Tom Hanks play with your shipments.<br />6. The drivers smell bad.<br />7. Their website uses too much white.<br />8. Brown is a cooler color than green and purple.<br />9. Federal Express is working with the Feds.<br />10. DHL roxx my soxx.<br /><br />By the way, Rachel prank called me earlier this weekend. I'm not sure if I should be offended or not. Suppose she was intoxicated. Suppose she was pressured by her peers. Suppose she hates me. I don't know what to take of it. I'm just glad I haven't exploded in rage. I'm usually terribly offended by prank calls. After I get prank calls, I usually kill my self-esteem. I always feel like I'm worthless to other people when my peers prank call me. I'm kind of sad right now. It makes me feel used. <br /><br />Well, signing out...
