Average Yo reporting.
<br />I should be in bed by now, but I just had to update.
<br />Anyways, I am doing this huge "Invention Convention" thing at school. I'm doing most of the work and everyone else is just "chillin". Anyways, I went bezerk while doing a worksheet and decided to go on a freeware downloading spree. It seems exciting, but with a 48k dial-up internet connection, it isn't. I got all the necessary tools like adaware and freshdownload. These are programs that help with downloading. And best of all, they are free! I like free things. Except that candy they give you at Wal-Mart on holidays. Oh yea, I didn't like that free cake they had at Best Buy. I should stop talking about free things before I throw up. Anyways, Karl told me to download this game called "Gun Bound". It's a tank game and it seems fun. Karl said it was simple, and fun. It turns out this "simple" game is 94MEGABYTES! It was a shocker. And now I'm going to have to wait all night for this 94MEGABYTE file to download. What makes me really envious is that with a T1 connection (1.5MEGABYTES per second), I would have to wait about 60 seconds for it to load. I'm waiting 6 HOURS. Boo hoo for me. I have to sleep. I wish I had a T1 connection. You know, all the nerds have'em. Why can't I?
