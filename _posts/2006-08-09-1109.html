I talked to my girlfriend for a long time on the Internet. Now it's late and I still have to take a shower.<br /><br />Have I mentioned that Tiffany is my girlfriend in this blog before? I don't think I have. A link to her blog is in my sidebar if anyone's interested.<br /><br />We've been "officially" dating since July 14th. Yup. It's the truth. <br /><br />I'm going to hit the "Post & Publish" button now, and not regret it. Because what is there to hide? Absolutely nothing.<b> I love her a lot, and there's no shame in that.</b> I have been taking steps to hide it, as if it's some bad thing to be in a relationship with someone. Well, I'm convinced now that it's not a bad thing. <br /><br />I want to yell at myself myself, <i>"What's so embarassing about it?"</i>, and, <i>"Why can't I tell my parents?"</i><br /><br />They'll find out eventually. And if this post helps speed up the process, all the better. There's no point in holding it in. I love her. I love everything about her. I've come to love her over the past two years. Now I know that she loves me too. <br /><br />I'm so very lucky.<br /><br />More will be posted later.
