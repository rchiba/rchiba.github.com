Hey blog-thing!
<br />I know, I haven't updated in a long time and for that I send my deepest apologies. I have been quite busy trying to keep my little sister happy and alive... lol. Alive meaning I've been hitting her a lot lately because she's been asking for it, and also, she's been hitting me and it's a reflex. Christmas went well, except for the fact that I nearly had a panic attack when I went to Kurt's Grandmothers, Oma's. There were way to many people and I am not proud to say I saw something I shouldn't have. Luckily my little sister and I got to stay outside for elongated periods of time. My sister then came over on Christmas morning and Christmas night we stupidly ventured out to see the neighbor's Christmas lights. Oh well, I was in a ticked off mood. Angel wouldn't stop picking on me and Mom and Kurt's severe intoxication issue wasn't helping. Last night we walked in on something quite repulsive. I think my eyes are burning! LOL! 
<br />I seem like I'm complaing but I am not trying to. i'm just telling about my life and its crappiness from time to time. I spent a whole day trying to beat one level of a game, I finally figured out I had to boost my players level this morning -_-
<br />anyways, I also haven't been updating because I haven't been on the internet. Mother has been very irritable towards me lately, f course os have I. I felt like killing nearly everyone in this house at some points. The idiocy annoys me such a great deal. 
<br />On higher note, I have been working on my stories and I've gotten quite an interesting plot line on each one! My favorite is Project Fallen Angel. t's set in the year 4000 and.... Well I don't want to give the plot away, but it's pretty interesting. My really long book is at a standstill however, I'm so disappointed. I'm trying to seek inspiration. Oh well.
<br />I'll try to update again later.
<br />~Amanda
