Anger, dispair, envy, sadness... All mixed in today...
<br />
<br />I mean, it all started out in supervised study when Janet called me "smart". I mean, she should just shut up and stop judging me by these idiotic things like grades, or that I'm in honors classes. I mean, all you have to do is set your priorities streight in elementary school and middle school, and you're in a good position in high school, which happens to put you in a good position when you're in college, which leads to a good position in your career, and a good retirement. All because of your priorities in 5th grade. Never thought about it that way did you? And now alot of people are stuck in a rut. A rut so hard to get out of, many just drop out of high school. Think about it.
<br />
<br />Then came quizbowl. I think I'm the most inarticulate, inactive, inconcivebly dull person on the team. I am quiet to everyone's dismay, and I just purely suck at my questions. I just am a terrible person. That and I have trouble understanding things. Like logarithms. I HAVE to study them tomorow so I can do them. I feel like a failure. That on top of Janet's comments on my so called "smartness".
<br />
<br />Next comes Diving. I lack coordination, skill, and flexibility. Thus, I am terrible at anything that is a sport. Tennis, Diving, you name it, I stink at it. I am slowly falling behind Ryan and everyone else. I'm still on my approach and he's on the flips. I'm still on the front dives, he's on the backwards dive. Whenever I come out of the water, my coach tries to say something nice like, "That's better", or "That's ok..." or something like that to try to encourage me. I don't know if it's sincere or he's just feeling sorry for how much I suck at diving. 
<br />
<br />You know what? I'm feeling really failuristic today. I'm just a total failure.
