I'm progressing with project "CoverAll." In this project, I am trying to cover up my walls with doodles that I scrawl onto cheap notepads. This way, my wall will have things to look at besides National Geographic maps, statistics, predictions, and demographics. I mean, who would want to look at a map of Syria and see how much GDP it has, when you can just look at my silly drawings?<br /><br />A few hours ago, I found a forum dedicated to fans of JACK, which I am enjoying reading. It seems the furry fandom subculture is just chock full of freaks, rejects, goths, and otherwise minority weirdos. I can't find a single "normal" person who *admits to* like this stuff. It's an atrocity to find this subculture riddled with the holes of oversensationalized news that's such a poor representative of such a culture.<br /><br />Somehow, I think that if I criticize myself enough, people will start to think I'm absolutely horrible at what I'm criticizing and will be impressed with what I do, but I don't think that'll be the case since no one actually looks at the stuff i'm criticizing in the first place. Meh, I've had my fair share of traumatizing social experiences, I'm not risking being overconfident ever again, except when I'm configuring electronics.
