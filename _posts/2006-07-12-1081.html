Reality is harsh. Or rather, waking up to reality is harsh. Tired. I've been very tired recently, but I can't convince myself to stop functioning, lay down, and sleep. I can only sleep when I know there isn't anything better to do, which is very late at night. Somehow, my twisted mind thinks that sleeping isn't as important as pointless meandering around the anthro section DeviantArt looking for good opportunities to leave a comment. I see myself during these times, and am disturbed at how pathetic my actions are.<br /><br />The physical fatigue outweighed my mental urges to stay up when I sat down on the couch and fell asleep at approximately 8PM. Someone was in the shower, so I couldn't further progress my "get ready for sleep" process. That is why I was on the couch. Almost spontaneously, I started dreaming about giant birds eating my legs. Although the dream was very graphic, the feeling experienced was very relaxed and comfortable. Finally, I was getting some much needed rest.<br /><br />Thirty minutes and a few dreams later, my sister is telling me that the shower is open. Half-asleep, I sit up, mutter some gutteral throat noises, and fall back asleep. It was so comfotable to be asleep, I didn't want to wake up and go back to reality, go back to being awake and tired. I wanted to be asleep and relaxed.<br /><br />Fifteen minutes pass. I'm still dozed off on the couch. I wake up for a moment, startled from something in the dream. My return landing into reality is rough. The bright light from a nearby lamp irritates my eyes. Everything around me starts to shift around in all directions as I scan my eyes around me room. I try to stand up, but my motor control is still well under normal levels. I stagger to the shower and turn on the water. <br /><br />Hot water doesn't help. I start feeling thirsty and accidentally drop the green bar of soap on my foot. I spend two minutes trying to pick it up from the floor of the shower. Each attempt to grab the soap fails, and the precise movemements needed to obtain the soap are in short supply. As I try to get a grip on the idiotic soap, my mind is trying to get a grip on being conscious.<br /><br />The antics continue until I drink a cup of water in the kitchen. The world returns to its previous sane state. Upon which I question whether I was really tired at all, or just dehydrated.<br /><br />Next time I'll save myself the hassle and just drink more water.<br /><br />
