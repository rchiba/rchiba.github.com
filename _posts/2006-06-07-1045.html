Summer school started today, and what a wonderful time it was. Four hours of US History sounds dry, and it is, but the perk of sitting next to another human being is great. Even when it's doing a worksheet, or writing down notes, or watching another biased movie about the American Revolution, it's comforting to be reminded that there <i>are</i> indeed other people out there. <br /><br />A single day of summer school covers a lot. Missing two days in summer school is a little harder to make up than missing two days of ordinary classes. I have to take four tests tomorrow. It's just straight-up memorization. Years, names, sequences, who, what, where, when, why, and how. Papers and papers, notes, lots of them. My horrible ink scribblings of an outline that tell of how the Native Americans (<i>Not the "Indians"!</i>) were hostile to early colonists. <br /><br />The room is cold, so I plan to wear heavier clothing tomorrow. The whole time I was putting my hands together to conserve body heat. In this way, centralized temperature control systems are flawed. Some rooms are too cold, some are too hot. There's no real way to compensate for the adverse temperature, so the students are forced to cope.<br /><br />I noticed that I'm much more lenient on myself over the summer. In class today, I turned in a worksheet to the teacher. After he promptly returned it, I found that I missed a whole three problems. Usually, I pester myself about such things all day until I'm too worked up to concentrate. All of those chemistry quizzes, English reports, and math problems. Missing enough to bother me would ultimately result in feelings of failure and despair. Looking at these same missed problems today, I see an opportunity to learn, not a consequence of my inability to retain information. It's a great feeling to be free from one's own guilt. Life seems so much brighter.<br /><br />After school, I came home and reinstalled the operating system on one of the semi-old computers in the house (circa 2001). I have been wanting to gut the computer and reinstall the OS for a long time now, since it's been clogged beyond repair from junk that I downloaded ages ago, when I didn't know so much about computers. That's around 4 years of downloaded junk, not to mention around 2 years of junk downloaded from my sister. About a year ago, I tried to establish rules on the computer to keep it moderately clean of malware, but by then the computer was already beyond cleaning. Another year of trying to ignore the problem (by using another computer) passed, but the truth finally reached me. <br /><br />So, today I formatted the hard drive twice by accident, but I was eventually able to get Windows XP up and running. It's a wonderful feeling to install drivers and utilities on a fresh hard drive. Drastic start-up time and performance improvements just go to show how horrible the state of the computer was earlier. Now, I'm just glad that it's clean. I can go to sleep without having BSOD nightmares.<br /><br />Well, it's time to study history. Tomorrow is going to be a good day.
