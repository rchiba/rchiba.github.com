The master of all things last minute, Devin went to the movies with me. Everything seems to be happier with Devin. It's his attitude, his minute gestures, his ideaology. Good things will come to Devin in the future, since people like him are rewarded in "this" society.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have diving practice tomorow, and I'm not sure if I should go or not. I suppose I should, but my lazy self is telling me to put it off, even though I need the practice. Maybe I should quit diving, but then everyone would be mad at me, so now I'm stuck in a rut. I can't quit, I can't complain, I have no choice.
<br />
<br />I am sleepy. I still can't find a decent DVD ripper. Frustrating... Panzerwerst!
