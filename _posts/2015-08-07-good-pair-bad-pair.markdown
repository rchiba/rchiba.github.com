* A good partner understands __pairing is a difficult skill__ that takes time and effort to cultivate. A bad partner expects others to be great pairs right off the bat.
* A good partner __seeks to understand their own bad pairing habits__. A bad pair fails to think about their own pairing habits and only blames others.
* A good partner __brings up mistakes__ that they make and that others make in a way that turns a mistake into an improvement opportunity. A bad partner bottles up issues they have while pairing and allows the issues to harm relationships and their quality of life at work.
* A good partner frequently __syncs up on schedule and goals__ and is not afraid to adjust the schedule to make it more realistic. A bad partner does not talk about schedule or goals and avoids adjusting the schedule until the last minute, causing confusion and mismatched expectations.
* A good partner __sets small achievable goals and celebrates__ achieving them. A bad partner sets one big (likely unrealistic) goal and stresses out about achieving it.
* A good partner __clearly communicates availability__. A bad partner disappears for unpredictable periods of time with no notice leaving the other partner to work alone and confused.
* A good partner uses __2 input devices and 1 computer__ and avoids using 2 computers unless necessary. A bad partner defaults to using 2 computers and gets distracted / unpaired.
* A good partner __balances give and take__ in decision making. A bad partner will not be aware of the decision making balance and either be a bunny or Alpha Male.
* A good partner is __aware of skill differences__ and works to rebalance them by making the effort to be a mentor or a student.
* A good partner will continue to help with an epic __all the way to the finish line__ and after with deployment tasks and bug fixes. A bad partner will stop contributing to the epic once the feature is accepted and not help their pair get the feature stable and in production.

## A good partner focuses on cultivating the following pairing roles
* __Mentor__ - explains concepts and reasoning with minimal judgement
* __Moleskine__ - maintains state and checks for edge cases and unexpected side effects
* __Captain__ - cultivates their own soft skills necessary in effective pairing and cultivating their partners as well

## And a bad partner falls into the following bad pairing roles
* __Alpha Male__ - mainly takes in a give and take discussion
* __Superman__ - grabs keyboard and starts coding quickly and silently
* __Bunny__ - mainly gives in a give and take discussion
* __Rodolfo Valentino__ - never disagrees with their partner's decision
* __Monk__ - does not acknowledge the validity of other's ideas
* __Puppet Master__ - uses their influence to control the driver's coding
* __Backseat Driver__ - uses their voice to control the driver's coding
* __Auditor__ - nitpicks small, trivial decisions at the expense of larger and more important decisions

## About Drivers:
* A good driver frequently __asks for agreement on ambiguous choices__. A bad driver makes difficult choices silently and does not ask the navigator for input. 
* A good driver __makes easy decisions fast__. A bad driver constantly asks for input on decisions that do not require input.
* A good driver __is aware of the navigator's focus__ and will ask for input or suggest trading off if they notice the navigator is distracted.
* A good driver __thinks out loud__ and communicates intentions and reasons.

## About Navigators:
* A good navigator is __continuously sanity checking code__. A bad navigator is checking their phone for text messages.
* A good navigator __anticipates next steps__ and maintains the overall state of the system, reminding the driver about necessary changes that may have been overlooked. A bad navigator is working on a bug while simultaneously attempting to pair, but not contributing to the pair.
* A good navigator __is aware of their own focus__, and suggests switching roles if they notice that their focus is slipping. A bad navigator allows their focus to deteriorate and is afraid of suggesting to switch roles.

## Lastly:
* __A good pair has built the rapport between them to share a few laughs while pairing and have fun__.
