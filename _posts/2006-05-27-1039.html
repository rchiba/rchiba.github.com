I finished my book, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, today. I sat in my hot, musty, upstairs extra room and read. The air conditioning in my house is now rationed, so the whole house is only a scarce few degrees cooler than the outside. Humidity makes it worse. So, there I was. Sitting in the hottest room of the house, sitting in a lone office chair, in my hand a thick paperback book. The front cover is torn off, the exposed pages are yellow with age, the corners bent in, and the backing wrinkled from many foldings. The spine of the book is a light turquoise color, presumably, in a time long ago it used to be a more vibrant green. The pages are thin and weak from previous readers. <br /><br />I sit and read a tale of a poor Oklahoma family traveling to California to find work. I look down at my wristwatch, and it's 8am. I start reading, and keep reading. I just can't stop. The pages in my right hand slowly move toward the left, and eventually I'm left with one page left. Reading the last sentence again, I realize that the room looks different. I look down at my wristwatch, and it's 9:30pm. <br /><br /><i>How could this be!? </i><br /><br />The windows are still bright, but a different kind of bright from the midday sun. The faded orange light creeps across the room, and slowly things get dimmer and dimmer. I'm left sitting there thinking about the book. Thinking of the poor, honest lives of the migrant workers of the past. And somehow, I was able to relate more. Perhaps it was because I had done nothing in the past few days, or maybe it was because I had forgotten to eat both lunch and dinner. The tale of the migrant worker family was powerful, and it came to life. It was as if I was there. Floating alongside the characters, watching them slowly get sick and die, lose hope, then gain it back again. Floating next to the old Hudson Super-Six, chugging along at a decent 30mph across the desert. I was there when Noah walked away, and when the Grandparents died. I was there when the boxcars were flooded. I was there, saw it as clear as day, when Rev. Casy was clubbed to death in the head.<br /><br />It's so odd how when one has time to relax and see the words played out, the story becomes so much more clear. I felt emotion, and I'm usually cold and heartless when it comes to reading fiction. It's all an elaborate story, that's all. But, it's not. There were really poor farmers, and there were really thousands, millions of migrants, and there were starving children. And it's hard to even start to imagine that there was a great dust bowl that took place in the last century, in my backyard. A whole nation, displaced. People on the road, abandoning their homes, their land. Can  you imagine? I sure can't.<br /><br />The television flickers with color as I watch news while I brush my teeth. The beautiful cars, the amazing diet pills, fancy energy drinks, premium, gourmet cat food. <br /><br />And I think to myself,<i> "Premium gourmet cat food? There are people dying of malnutrition out in the world. And we've got the nerve to sell and buy premium cat food!?"</i><br /><br />The commercials look good, the music is selected just so. The actors make the product visually and emotionally appealing. There must be a lot of money going into marketing. A lot of money going into marketing premium cat food. A lot of money going into feeding cats.<br /><br />Not enough money going into feeding people though.<br /><br />We're feeding cats and not people. The cats eat cake, while the people die of overconsumption, and in other places, underconsumption. <br /><br />Suddenly, everything seemed more and more absurd. How things work. People idle their cars in the parking lot, keep their home air temperature uncomfortably low in the summers, every week pour gas into machines meant to keep our grass at a certain height, take plastic instead of paper, drive outrageously fast, and we complain about oil prices? We hawk global warming as if it's just another disease to throw money at. Yes, yes, let us throw money and the problem will go away. Yes, yes, let us build better cars so the problem will go away. Yes, yes, let us build more dams, windmills, and nuclear reactors, and the problem will go away. <br /><br />But, it won't. The problem won't go away. We've fermented, too rich for our own good. Less than eight decades ago, people in this country were living under cardboard roofs and eating fried dough. Now we're driving our big, fast, and fancy cars around town, mindlessly going to our shopping malls to spend money, stocking our cupboards with gourmet cat food. And there are holocausts, mass murders going on not a night's flight on a jet plane away from here. Think about it. It's not just a moving picture on the television, it's not just another article in the paper, it's people. People like us. Living, breathing people. People with feelings, stories, worries, beliefs. And we don't do a damned thing about it. <br /><br />A kid at my school was trying to get into student council with a plan to divert money from humanitarian aid fundraisers to school dances. This person matter-of-factly explained her master plan to the class, and most nodded along. Some even took delight in thinking of the future dances. But, no delight for me. <br /><br />My mind raged, <i>"School dances!? Why the fuck do <b>we decrepit shitheads</b> have to dance for? To forget about our problems? To enjoy ourselves? Why should money that would go to keep a family living be diverted to fund our own idiotic social pleasure? Is there no reason in these stupid people?!"</i><br /><br />These thoughts kept bothering me all day, months ago. They still bother me today. But, it's so clear, the answer. Disturbingly clear. Clear from looking at all the clear car windows, clear shopping mall displays, clear cases holding clear diamonds, a clear bottle of clear mineral water, our clear houses with clear people. Our clear souls. We can all see each other, and we all see each other as clear people. But, none of us are clear at all. Hardly opaque.<br /><br />I'm sure the migrant families of the past would look at our opulence and luxury in scorn. I'm sure the refugee families of today feel the same way. But, they don't have time to worry about the richness of others. It's day to day, a matter of survival. And to us, well, we don't have much to say about it.<br /><br />"How unfortunate", we all mumble. Muttering under our breath. Then, we brush it off and forget. <b>As long as we get our Mickey D's, our overpriced iPod accessories, and our Ford Explorers, it really doesn't matter to us the sufferings of others.</b> <br /><br />And that's the clearest answer I can think of.
