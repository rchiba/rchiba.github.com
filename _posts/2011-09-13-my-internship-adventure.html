When I got my internship offer from Yahoo!, I was ecstatic and relieved. I'll admit to rolling around in bed for a good five minutes. After all, it has been a long, uncertain six months of putting aside fears of rejection and navigating completely unfamiliar application territory. Now, sitting in a very happy spot, I feel that I must to record the path the led me here, before I forget what happened.

So, six months ago was, what... October? Early companies were beginning to recruit for interns. At this point, I knew that I wanted an internship, and I had a general sense of what I was looking for in one. I wanted to meet people who develop software for a living. I wanted to learn how things are done "In the Real World". I wanted a meaningful project. And access to mentors. Most of all, I wanted to be in an environment where people were enthusiastic about the product, whatever that product might be. So around this time, I hear from friends that Microsoft is coming to campus. At an info session, I drop off my resume and two weeks later, I get an email asking me for an on-campus screening interview. I go to the interview. I repeat this process with Zynga.

In both cases, I was woefully unprepared for the interview. I answered only a handful of the many technical questions they threw at me, and I felt myself stutter on the behavioral questions. Yes, I studied, I read through other people's experiences on the web, and I practiced in a mirror. But, I think some things just take practice. And to truly practice for an interview, <strong>you need to be interviewed</strong>. After the Microsoft interview, the interviewer even said, "<em>Still a junior? Ah, you still have time to try again next year.</em>" Ouch.

However, I felt that given a couple more chances, I could do better. So, I received my rejections and prepared for the Spring. How did I prepare? I made a spreadsheet.

And I spent an entire weekend combing through a couple of lists to find out where I could apply to. I settled on thirty companies that I would try to apply to, based on lists of "best companies to work for", as if something so subjective could be evaluated.

The arrival of Spring semester was signaled by the ubiquitous engineering career fair. Reading through the list of employers: Amazon, Cisco, Intel, VMWare, you could already tell the quad was going to be packed with suits, sweat, tears, and blood. These are companies that mean business, and they're ready to weed out people with on-the-spot questions.

&nbsp;

TL;DR:
- Make a spreadsheet of who you want to work for, use it to keep track of your progress, and apply to a company every day
- Submit through multiple vectors. Online, through recruiters at the career fair, and at special events
- Use flash cards to learn about the languages you put on your resume (some handy sites: )
- At the end of any interview, ask questions that show that you're planning on working there
