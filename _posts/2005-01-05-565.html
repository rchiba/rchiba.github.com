Wonderful news for myself has saved me from the brink of a terrible day!
<br />
<br />There is a two hour delay tomorow for school, but that's just a short term enjoyment. I really don't want to dive anymore. Once I get lazy, I can't deal with doing any work. I'm such a lazy bum. There are two long-term happinesses. Devin is comming back to my high school, where he belonged in the first place. The next class is that I have a class where I get to sit next to Amanda, which totally roxxors because she is the most... I don't know... She's just really easy to talk to... You get started and you keep going and the conversation seems to train on, but still retaining its original integrity. It doesn't fade with Amanda. Mostly because the tangents that are strayed upon are usually crazy.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I will be waiting for Devin. 
<br />
<br />Also, I've heard from many sources that the "Keyboarding" classes HAVE to be taken before the bussiness classes. That is the most illogical thing I've ever heard. What if you can ALREADY type? I find this intriguing since most of the young population already know how to type. Do the teachers think we need a class to teach us how to ride a bike? Give me a break...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am paying more attention to the tsunami effort. I mean, the tsunami has a larger impact to me, morally, than the World Trade Center attacks or the war in Iraq. The question to ask yourself is this... "Which is more important? The lives of hundreds of thousands of poor people or three thousand rich people?"
<br />
<br />Good night. Let tommorow bring peace.
