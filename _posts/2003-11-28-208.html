It is the day after "Turkey Day" as the stereotyped Americans call it.
<br />I don't even eat turkey. Turkey isn't even called for! It's called Thanksgiving, not a day to eat turkeys. I hate stereotyped holidays like this.
<br />
<br />Anyways, that holiday has passed. Today would be described a dreary and cloudy. I think I'm getting cabin fever. I don't know, maybe I really am. Also, I am still angry at Devin. So if I were Devin, I would stay away from me. I have been practicing the moonwalk and I think I'm getting pretty good at it. Anyways, it is a freezing day today, with the red mercury just inching up right above zero degrees celcius. And yet my sister goes outside to rollerblade, outrageous. Besides that I am bored and hungry, I have no feelings. Sitting here with no opinions, rants, angers, It's a very boring me If you tell me. My mom and I are deciding where to put the christmas tree. Were thinking of putting it in the sunroom, but were not sure. This keyboard makes alot of noise, it sounds like a locomotive, I wish it made sounds like a typewriter. I love that sound. tick tick tick. KACHING!
<br />
<br />Anyways, since it is cold, there is no outside contact. I am just sitting here wasting my time typing pointless things into an endless array of pages with an unsurrmountable amount of info. I guess this really is kind of pointless. Also, if Blogger or BlogSpot goes bankrupt of kaput, then my lifes work will poof into nothingness... Just like *....
<br />
<br />There is nothing to do, there is nothing to do....
