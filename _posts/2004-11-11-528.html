Time flies when you're angry, cynical, depressed, and overworked. I know it.
<br />
<br />Anyways, the climax of my day is when I get to sit here in my room listening to classical music on NPR radio and just ranting on about my sucky life that is so great. Actually, the real high point of today will be when I vacuum my room. That's the life. I hope I can go to some places that stock up on AOL cd's. I need some for my desk enlargement I am planning to build with the AOL cd cases. AOL cd cases are a great way to make free furniture. 
<br />
<br />When I think about it, I really appreciate this peaceful moment in my life where I can just sit and type. 
<br />
<br />Ryan said that he had "better things to do" than me. I wasn't sure if he was implying that my lifestyle is inferior to his, or implying that my hobbies suck. Either way, it was a very rude comment, but we all make mistakes. I forgive Ryan, obviously because he's my friend. Now that I think about it, I have more contacts now than ever. High School has alienated me and created new contacts at the same time. Wow.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I was thinking about school killing rampages today. How could you engineer a school to lessen the damage of killing rampages. Suppose they make all of the corners in the school rounder. Would that effect anything? I just wonder around in my brain about this stuff while I'm walking in the hallway. Usually, there's a cluster of popular talking drones clumping together in the middle of a crucial intersection. While I'm waiting for these idiots to move, or for some angry football player to push them aside for me, I think about the people around me. Sometimes I make up stories about them based on their looks on their faces. You know, everyone has a story, even I.
<br />
<br />Today, someone asked me, "are you OK?". I said, "yes". She said that I looked sad. Well, I replied that I'm always sad or angry or insane, and that's what makes me myself. I was surprised someone actually thought about me.
<br />
<br />Sometimes I the stress builds up and I can't stand it anymore. Sometimes I think about killing myself. Yes, you probably think I have some kind of problem, but think about it. You have thought about killing yourself, but everyone is smart enough to recognize that this feeling is completely irrational. I agree. After I realize that what I am thinking is stupid, I feel like a poser. Like a person who wants to kill themselves just to get attention, which totally defeats the purpose of killing yourself. I feel like I'm just an attention hog, kind of like Hunley at East Tipp. He did things for the sole purpose of getting attention from others. I don't want to be like him. That's why I always shrug it off. When I read about teenage suicide, I think to myself, did they really mean it? Was it an impulse action? Did they not see that killing yourself is pointless? It won't solve your problems, because you won't exist anymore. I suppose it would carry some purpose if you believed in heaven and all of that, but I don't think suicide is a even remotely rational alternative. If other people have to deal with it, so do you. Maybe the suicidee was just lazy. Too lazy to deal with everything. Or maybe they were bored. It's so interesting prying into these kinds of lives. Trying to figure out what's going on in their minds. I find it facinating to see what's going on in others minds.

<br />Anyways, time flies when you're overworked and despotic. I can't believe tomorow is Friday. I can't remember what true relaxation feels like.
