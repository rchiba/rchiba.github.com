How marvelous is my life?<br /><br />I should get used to staying up late. It's inevitable that I'll just stop sleeping completely. For now though, it'll just be staying up "late".<br /><br />The first official build-season Robotics meeting was today. And the funny thing about it was that...<br /><br />Well, actually, nothing was funny about the meeting itself, but rather, the people in it.<br /><br />One person in particular.<br /><br />I've always liked to psychologically pick on Russel in my mind. I find him a facinating creature, like an extinct animal that somehow has come to life again. His social cues, so correctly timed sometimes, but the mood he casts is so negative. He lets his tone of voice speak to one as if his words really didn't matter. He could say something nice, and injure one's feelings deeply from his rash tone. <br /><br />I don't understand this mystical being that I know as Rus. I really can't comprehend how sophisticated his mind must be. He is so closed-minded, but he can cheer you up on a bad day. He is so inherently annoying, but his psyche is magnetic. I don't... can't seem to describe him.<br /><br />This afternoon, I was talking about how I was going to stay after school and sit in the cafeteria for a few hours to wait for robotics to start. He mentioned to me that it was against the rules. And even though his comment was so quip and so insignificant, it had this draw to it... His voice had utter seriousness embedded into it that somehow his message that in reality said "Isn't that against school rules?" turned into, "Do not stay inside after school. That is an order. Do not disobey my order."<br /><br />And it bothered me throughout the day. It bothered me so much that I sat outside in the cold for those hours, on the icy concrete that lines the building. I sat there obeying him, and it puzzled me greatly. <br /><br />I asked myself, "Why am I listening to a message that was never given to me?"<br /><br />The fact of the matter was, the message was indeed given to me. But, I believe that I gave it to myself through Rus. Or, he has some sort of vocal quality that is able to transmit information to me, that coincided with his body language of inner hostility led me to believe that I think now is something on the fringe of paranormal.<br /><br />Sometimes Rus can't get it into his head that he is wrong, but his headstrong, closed-minded personality adds a mystique to his nature. What is under his skin that makes him like that? What kind of environmental factors has influenced such behavior in this "typical" American teen? Who is he?<br /><br />The mysterious Rus will continue to evade me until I discover his core. The core that I so love to hate, but cannot because of his innate ability to help me feel like what I'm supposed to feel like.<br /><br />A human being.
