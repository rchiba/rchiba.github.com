I should really start studying my French. <br /><br />But this morning I thought differently. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" target="_blank">cough suppressants</a> I took this morning led to a relaxing of my mind. And due to the strategic timely position of French class as my first one of the day, I was drowsy all through it. I remember being happy and having a mild sensation of warmth that surrounded me and isolated me from the world. (In the afternoon, I would figure out that I had been sweating.) So, as my teacher had said the day before, we took a vocabulary quiz. Very simple, and very easy. Nonetheless, I managed to get a 72% on it. If not for the medicines, I would have cared. Cared a lot.<br /><br />The person who sits in front of me cared a lot. She got eight percent more on the quiz than me. And she knows this, as she looked at mine as she passed it back to me. The person who sits in front of me is two grades below me, as she is a very accelerated student. She is one of "those" people who make a big deal out of grades. And in certain situations, I fit in that category as well. In this certain situation, the chemicals from the medicines somehow kept me from caring about my grade. <b>I was so happy.</b> And I began to understand why so many people live and die by drugs, because it makes them happy. <br /><br /><i>This is a B! My mother won't accept this! What am I going to do?</i><br /><br />This may not be a direct quote, but this is what the girl in front of me said. Now that I think about it, it is a slap in the face for me, a much older student for her to complain and whine and yammer in my face, even though she got 8% more than me. Perhaps she doesn't understand that what she does makes other people feel inferior.<br /><br />But, I was too hazed to care about her rudeness. <b>Too happy to care.</b> And it was the best feeling ever, to be free from the confines of my self-discipline. To break the proverbial chains that I have wrapped around myself over time. For a moment, I wanted to just run away from it all and forget about school, and forget about homework, and forget about my commitments. <br /><br />As the day wore on, I slowly drifted back to reality, as well as my cold symptoms.<br /><br />The girl who sits in front of me may never know that feeling though. And this makes me sad for her.
