Less sleep, less logic, less cognitive function.
<br />
<br />The homework, the stress, the new computer, and the new DVD drive from hell, all take up time. I don't have time anymore. I can't go to sleep like I used to. I have to promise myself that tomorow will be better though. That is the only way I'll get through life tomorow. I'll live for the sake of this blog. 
<br />
<br />I felt like an outcast today. I guess I'll feel sorry for myself by myself. I mean, I guess I was never "meant" to be sociable. Nerd by trade, writer at heart. I can never be sociable. I try not to show emotion. I cannot express myself in speech. I cannot admit to being happy. I am only an avatar of myself, currently. Once I get more time, I'll start returning to myself. I must get though tomorow.
