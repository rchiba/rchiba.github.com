Once upon a time, there was a planet called "Average School". On this planet, there were 3 races. One race was the Pops. They like to be deceptive and fool people, allthewhile being traitors. Their beauty is only skin deep, and their evil runs deep into their veins. They are the Pops. The other race is the Dums. The Dums have given up all hope, sadly submitting to the relentless Pops. The Dums have just given up on everything, their grades, their future, their social standing. They are sometimes happy, because they can't understand what real joy is. The Pops tell them what to be happy about, so they are easily manipulated. These are the Dums. The next race is the Nrts. They Nrts like to hide away from the Pops, coming out only to try to understand how the Pops work. The Nrts are intrigued by anything they see. They must understand it if they can. They like to work, alot. This makes them angry and moody sometimes. Other Nrts are always happy, trying to justify their work through funny excuses. The Pops ridicule the Nrts. The Dums immitate the Pops. Then their are the "others". They don't fit in any category, but rather waver between the three. Sometimes, they share characteristics. Whatever suits their fancy, they go. In planet "Average School", there was a big commotion. The Pops were hosting a ritualistic ceremony in the planet capitol. The Pops and the Dums celebrate. The Nrts are confused. Why should they go? They have no friends, nor care to have any. Everyone else ridicules them. And the funny thing is that the Nrts don't even realize it. They just keep living... Just keep walking... Just keep working... And Just keep moving. Who cares about the others when you can have your own little piece of the world in your mind? You have your own priorities, and you don't want others to influence them. You are yourself, so be you. Go out there and do something. The worlds waiting.
