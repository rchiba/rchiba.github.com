As we navigate throughout life, we wonder why others are so obnoxious. An obvious example would be when I was minding my own business and biking along the road, a large luxury SUV came roaring up the road and veered just inches from my head. On top of the obviously dangerous and hazardous driving, they opened their windows and screamed at me. I don't understand why, but it makes you think. If they can take the time to come inches from me, carefully coordinate window opening, and precisely calculate vocal projections from said window, then why don't they have the grey matter to understand ethics, or common morality? I'm sure they have enough sense to make a rational decision, but they just decided against it. If people can harass me in such a sophisticated way, then those people should be able to help people, for the good of humanity. But, instead those people take the path of forever shame. Shame in the name of the human race. Shame on them.<br /><br />I couldn't get their license plate, I'm nearsighted. Darned physical restrictions.
