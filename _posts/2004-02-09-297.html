Hello, it seems like another editor has appeared onto the scene.
<br />Average Yo here, with the ultimate realization of my sad present state.
<br />Shishir is really mean nowadays. He keeps telling me that I have no friends and that I am a loser. He also tells me that he has a ton of friends. Also, whenever I try to talk with him, he tells me to shut up because he doesn't care. I am unsure, but I think that Shishir has not been educated in the ways of manners. I mean, why am I still his friend? Is a friend who tells you to shut up, that you have no friends, that you are a loser? I mean, I have some good friends, just not INNERCIRCLE friends, like Norman. Anyways, he makes me really sad everyday because he keeps making me feel like a worthless fool. How can his other friends put up with him? He makes me feel like trash, and I put up with him every day. Every single stinking day of filth and anger and sadness and stagnant repose. EVERY DAY! A peice of my heart dies and shrivels up and falls into my intestines and is absorbed into the walls of my intestines. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, talking about the abdominal area, I felt a throbbing pain in my lower abdomen in gym today. While we were line dancing, the pain got harder to withstand. I felt like someone kept hitting me in the stomach with a bat, and all the while, I had to line dance. I was limping and with much adjournment, the music ended and I could finally collapse and feel more pain.
<br />
<br />Anyways, pain is so often seen in this world as bad. I think pain is more like a by-product of human society. Pain is essential for the survival of human society and its delicate structure. I think pain is needed for the world to go round. Consequently, I didn't complain about my pain in gym, I embraced it.
<br />
<br />Anyways, todays done and tomorows a commin' so I better wrap up because I have to go to the gym (hate that place). So bye.
<br />
