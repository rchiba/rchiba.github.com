I presented my speech today in *gasp* speech class today. I think I did pretty well, considering that everyone had positive comments on it. <br /><br />But, as I sat down after the speech, and the class clapped, and some people voicing their positive comments at me, I somehow felt like a plastic toy. An artificial plaything that is being manipulated by those who come near me. I speak so strongly in front of a crowd, but in small groups, I'm usually quiet. Or, at least that's how I see myself. For all I know, I might be the loudest person in my class and I'm just too shortsighted to realize this. I sometimes look at myself, and what I see is completely different from how I really am. I guess the details of life are in the eye of the beholder.<br /><br />And so, after giving my speech, I sit down in the dinky, plastic desk, and people are still making comments about my speech, and people keep talking, and I feel selfish for getting all the attention, and feel bad for all the unprepared people sitting in the corner who are going to have to go after me. So, the general roar of the class starts to meld into a thick, but acceptable whisper. And life goes on.<br /><br />I walk out of class, light headed from the rush of giving a speech, voice hoarse from speaking louder than I normally do, hands shaking from the excitement of giving a good speech. And as I walk out of class and dissipate into the crowd, I feel like s plastic toy that just ran out of batteries.<br /><br />For the next few hours, I spend my mundane day murmuring to myself about how the day is going to get better. <br /><br />It doesn't. <br /><br />It never does.<br /><br />But, Chemistry ended my day with a dull slap. I get a quiz over a chapter that is very easy. I turn it in, with a bit of doubt. The quiz itself is very small, five multiple-choice questions. After taking the quiz, Tif lets me read her poems, which is a big step for her, she's usually shy about that kind of thing. But, this action is quite an important one for me too. Life's all about trust, and if people trust me, it enables me to feel just a little bit better about myself, as a person. Tif showing me her poems says that she has a tiny inkling of trust given to me, like a gift. To me, it's like a little, shiny present that's always growing. That moment, right then in Chemistry class, was my highlight of the day. Another cherished present to take care of. <br /><br />As I talk to friends, I unfortunately realize that I missed a few questions on my quiz, thus causing me to fail (missing "a few" questions on a five question quiz=failure). My failure causes me to get angry, act stupid, and make a fool of myself by making such a big deal out of it. Afterwards, like now, I feel very self-centered for caring that much and expressing my misery to other people. Who do I think I am, the center of the universe? It disgusts me how I still do this. I should accept the fact that I am an eternally failing, always-wrong human being. <br /><br />I must to begin familiarizing myself with this fact.<br /><br />But, I'll hold onto my presents for the time being.
