Ahhhh... Tonight I had stew.
<br />It is soooooooooo good. I ate 3 bowls full. I love that stew! Well off the stew issue. I did alot more than computer today. I watered 2 lawns BY HAND! Washed my dog and its cage. Made a home-page. Clean the basement and its bathroom. Thats alot for me. It sure is. It was much more fulfilling than playing runescape all night. Well, thats the recap for tonight. Good night;)...
