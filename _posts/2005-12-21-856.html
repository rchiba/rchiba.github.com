My highlight of the day would have to be opening my mailbox and finding an invitation to be part of the "Junior American Miss" pageant this year.<br /><br />But, the only problem is that I am not female. <br /><br />I suppose my dreams will have to be dashed once more.<br /><br />Today was one of those days where one can get lots of hard things done, but still feel not-so-fantastic afterward.<br /><br />So what if I lost a game of chess to some half-wit racist in my World History class? It's not that big of a deal.<br /><br />But that wasn't it. It's never the chronologically closest thing that gets you in the end.<br /><br />I walked to the cafeteria with the chess kid on my back, boasting on and on (in a totally non-serious manner) about how he beat me at chess. And at the time, I really didn't care, or hoped that I wouldn't start caring, but as I walked into the cafeteria, and with the 36th derrogatory remark on my back, everything started to get heavy, emotionally.<br /><br />Some people say that emotions are for the weak, the immature. I say things things as well. But, I guess these things happen.<br /><br />Sitting at my lunch table, I find Andrew with his signature smirk, pointing at me. And the weight comes down. Before, the insults were from a subordinate, and underling that I could justifiably ignore. To find such a respected peer gesturing so obviously to me, it was too much for me. All of the text below, that nonsense that isn't even supposed to exist, came crashing down. <br /><br />It is and was a horrible circle. Andrew just pulled the trigger. He started talking, loudly, about how I failed to defeat one of my peers in a silly board game. It sounds so stupid, and I even thought this at the time, but he just pulled the fucking trigger, and so I succumbed.<br /><br />So I'm sitting at the table all teary-eyed, shaking, hazy-minded with all of the natural chemicals being circulated through my bloodstream, unable to look at any of my peers because I didn't wan't to reveal how weak I was/am. I distinctly remember not being able to feel my face. I also remember trying to get myself to stop behaving like this. After all, it was all so vain. Why should I even care? Acting like this showed that I cared about myself, and that demonstrated how selfish and vain I am. And so I hated myself for being in this sad state. This hate perpetuates more pressure and anxiety. It continues.<br /><br />And for a few arduously long minutes the nonsense continues. At this point, I'm really confused, unable to breathe normally, eyes red with salty liquid and expanded blood vessels. I begin to think about how Andrew must feel. So then along with my contempt for myself, guilt started to sink in about how I made Andrew feel bad.<br /><br />A light blue shirt comes into view. Rus sits down and he somehow gets me to start to chat about some cell phone conundrum involving my defective phone and my mother somehow calling Rus by accident. <br /><br />As time passes, and as I get more involved with my conversation with Rus, I start to feel better. After about fifteen minutes, Rus has me back on my feet and able to stop being such a self-centered attention-whore.<br /><br />I find it intriguing that this kid, a kid that I found very rude and obnoxious last year, helped me this year, while a kid that I've found very pleasant to be around instigated my inner conflicts. A flip of roles, I suppose.<br /><br />Fast forward 30 minutes.<br /><br />I'm fantastic, I talk to Andrew and resolve my conflicts. Everything is dealt with in a cookie-cutter fashion. We exchange a few words and disband. <br /><br />But through it all, I have no negative feelings about anyone, just extra positive feelings for some.<br /><br />*Note: My choice to use real first names is completely random.
