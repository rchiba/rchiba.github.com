Guess what I did today with my disabled self?<br /><br />Oh, you don't seem to care about my life? Well, I'll tell you anyways just for kicks and giggles (oh yes Amanda, I absolutely adore your sayings.)<br /><br />I played a video game. It doesn't even matter what it's called since it's amazing in itself that I actually played a real video game. A real one! A real video game with real textures with a real video card and a real game studio. A real video game!? Isn't it absurd? It drives me nuts to think I played a video game all day today. I did nothing productive. And to think, millions of hapless children are playing video games right now, not realizing the trap they are entering. Their unproductive hands and minds working to accomplish superficial goals that have no meaning. It's still driving me nuts! Why do children do this? Why do I do this? It's a disgusting human trait that just begs to be eliminated by a higher power! Yet, many church youth groups play these silly games. I'm sure that if Jesus, Mohammed, or even Confucius were here today, they would label gaming as a sin. See, games are the root of all evil. <br /><br />A perfectly fine society is being dragged down by games, game consoles, gaming networks, game stations, game magazines, game guides, and game cheats. And yet, I'm promoting it.<br /><br />Situational irony I suppose...
