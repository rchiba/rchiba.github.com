Today, was to say the least, average. Kinda like me...
<br />Anyways, if you want a BBS, EMAIL ME NOW!!!!!! THat means you!. I am so stupid. I just remembered that I forgot to go to lego league today. They are going to nag me and taunt me alot tomorow. Maybe, I can get to the meet in time, but that is very unlikely, especially because it is 30 minuites untill it ends. Oh well, I just gotta remember. I need to focus. Matt told me to change my poll and he wants his face on it, but i'm too lazy to put up a poll like that, so... I'm going to do another poll. Let me go change it....
