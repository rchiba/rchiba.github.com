Swords.<br /><br />What is the point of swords? They do nothing. Hunks of metal. Obsolete since the day gunpowder was created. Swords. You can throw them at your enemy, and surely miss. Swords. You can romanticize swords, chivalry, and swordsmanship, but end up finding that it's all about watching a bunch of royal pricks prance around and pretend to kill each other. Swords. Can't get any lower than a sword. At least rocks can be thrown effectively. You can't slingshot a sword and pretend to be Robin Hood, but end up hitting your kitchen window, having to explain the mess to your mother, and suffer a life of shame because of your window-breaking escapade, can you? Guns. Kill fast, efficiently. Guns. Shiny and metallic. You can adjust the noise created with a gun. You can kill someone many meters away with a gun. You can kill hundreds of people at a time with guns. Guns. The weapon of today.<br /><br />Swords. The weapon of the past. The weapon for pointless glorification. The weapon over-hyped to a maddening state. Swords. The weapon of choice for aristocratic yuppies who go to prep schools. Swords.<br /><br />Don't romanticize swords. Don't draw anime characters holding swords, and think it's cool. Don't talk about swords like you're some kind of amazing swordsman. Don't roleplay sword fights. Don't think swords hold some kind of mystical, holy power to win a battle. Swords. What's the point?<br /><br />Sponsored by our good friends at the NRA.
