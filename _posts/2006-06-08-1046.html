Today must have been the longest day of the summer.<br /><br />Sitting in a frigid classroom for four hours gets tiring, but working as a "pool attendant" for 6 hours in the blazing sun was even worse. I learned many things form my experience today in my mundane work.<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Fifteen times four does not equal forty-five.</b></li></ul><br /><i>At the pool, frozen treats cost 15 cents each. A little girl comes up to me and asks me for four treats and hands me a dollar. I go into the pump room with the refrigerator. I nervously ask the kid what flavors she wants. She wants two green and two purple. This is also when I learn that colors besides orange are also flavors. Anyways, I try to break the plastic seal between each frozen stick of sugar water, and succeed after I break a few of them. While I am doing this, I'm frantically trying to calculate 1.00-(.15x4). Unfortunately, I calculate wrong and hand the kid fifty five cents. I could say it was the heat that was getting to my mind, but in reality I have no excuse. Simply, my mathematical ability is at an all time low.</i><br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>Sunblock isn't a minor issue.</b></li></ul><br /><i>I put sunblock on my arms. In a rush to get to the pool, I forgot to put sunblock on my legs and feet. Six hours of constant sun later, the bottom half of my body is red and painful. Even now, my skin is paying for my inability to realize that sunblock is important.</i><br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>A proper greeting and a proper farewell are essential in attendant-attendee relations.</b></li></ul><br /><i>Being the shy person that I am, I had great trouble trying to figure out what to say to greet people who came in. They would usually say hello and ask me how I was doing, and I would struggle to produce a string of incoherent vowel sounds. Then, they would walk away. Embarrassing. But, after about eleven strings of incoherent vowel sounds, I was able to collect my thoughts and say "Hello", or even a "Welcome to the pool". The same situation with goodbyes as well. In the beginning, people leaving the pool would say "Bye" to me and I would just nod. This made me feel like I wasn't communicating enough, so I upgraded my farewell to "You folks have a good afternoon now." It's rather quaint, but it gets the job done.</i><br /><br />I have a driving test tomorrow. Exciting. Sometimes I really don't believe that I'm sixteen years old already. By the time I know it, I'll be sixty. And then what?<br /><br />
