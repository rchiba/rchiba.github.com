It goes without saying that I'm not a comformist.<br /><br />Then why do I care about what other people think about me?<br /><br />I don't.<br /><br />Or at least, that's what I tell myself.<br /><br />But if one pried open my senseless mind, one would find large deposits of self-consciousness.<br /><br />Alex emailed me about how attending a little meeting this morning would influence my future on the team. I suppose going to the meeting would preserve my "team integrity". I feel guilty about not going to the meeting because of Alex's indication to me that my inate Robotics Club teamness would be sacrificed to my lazyness. But, truely, there would be no purpose for me to go to the meeting. I don't see how I could help in any way, contribute in any way. If going to some meeting for no purpose is supposed to establish myself as a valid member of the club, then I might as well burn the school down and call my homework done. <br /><br />But, maybe there would have been something for me to do at the meeting. And this is the recurring thought that keeps me in a waking paranoia, the overwhelming guilt that keeps me from relaxing and enjoying life. There's always something that keeps me from being happy. Good things happen to me, but I'm too focused on how bad I am to notice. <br /><br />And so, as I go to sleep tonight, I wish the fear, the guilt, and the dread would just go away.<br /><br />But, my tonight my wishes will remain unanswered.
