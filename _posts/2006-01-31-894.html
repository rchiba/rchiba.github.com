I'm afraid of something I shouldn't be afraid of. Something that's going to come about no matter what I do, no matter how much I cower in the corner.<br /><br />Minutes, days, months, they pass by, uncountable in numbers, in endless varieties and flavors. Each one, being logged, but they still seem to disappear into nothingness. Nothing matters anymore besides the fact that my watch is still changing it's display, and that every second that I ponder the next word for this sentence has just slipped from my weak grip on reality. Think about it, every second, it's closer to the end. Life is just one big countdown until decomission, upon which, you are burned to ashes, remaining elements scattered onto the Earth, mourned for a few months, and then forgotten about. The thing that you thought was important. The thing that you've planned out, worked so hard for. The very thing that has driven humanity from its humble beginnings to where it is now is so very short. It's easy for me to understand that in the future, there will be no trace of me, physical or mental, but it is hard for me to accept this. So very hard.<br /><br />And it's a wonder why there aren't cluster suicides every other day at school.<br /><br />I read about them in my health book, while suffering from the wrath of stereotypical, poorly-structured public education. To alleviate my boredom, I turned to the chapter on suicide and depression. Ironically, the whole chapter makes me a tad bit worse off, emotionally. But, cluster suicides, you can guess what they are.<br /><br />So, I'm sitting there in health class and a group of girls are talking about how they are going to get their driver's licenses and drive to Florida for spring break, or something like that. After reading about the depression and whatnot, I was feeling kind of bad, and even though I knew that such a plan to go to Florida without parents was sure to fail, absurd as it is, it still made me feel even worse, that I couldn't go too. Somewhere deep inside of me, I wanted to go somewhere else too. But, I *knew* in my head that this was not a rational decision. But, still. A trace of passion to be free. <br /><br />A passion and want to be free, free from humdrum schedules, free from the structured routine of every day, of every week, of every month. Free from French class, free from grades, free from social conformity, free from what I now know so well as "life". My dream, to just drift around the world as an ethereal being, carrying no worries, no appointments, and no obligations. And so I escape from my perfect world, my idealistic universe of fantasy, and my dream remains a dream for the time being, <br /><br />as it's not reasonable for such a dream to ever come true.
