Sorry I haven't posted this weekend folks.
<br />Average Yo here, and my life has been buisy this weekend. Mathcounts was like a blur, time passed so quickly, and so quickly, it came to an end. Of course, east tipp didn't beat klondike (THEY ALWAYS WIN), but oh well. Time passes so fast when you actually are doing something, but now I am but a pawn in a huge chess arena, with the hierarchies of society being the rook, bishop, king, and queen. Oh yea, at mathcounts, this girl laughed so much she barfed. It was pretty crazy at Purdue yesterday. School is almost here, so I become happy once again. 
<br />
<br />My friend Norman called from Manchester Airport a few minuites ago. I really miss him. He is one of the ones at the top of my list of friends. The top of the top. The kind of friend you grow up with. And now it gets immensely harder and harder to see him. I've got summer gym, he goes to boarding school. I think the only time I can come to his house (or he come to mine) would be the beggining of August, and even Norman isn't sure he can come then. I miss Greenville, Alabama. With it's one Wal-Mart, population of 2,000, and all my friends, what's not to miss? Oh well, life changes and I have to go with the flow. Norman sure seems like he was pooped. Flying everywhere, staying at a boarding school, using his phone card to call me, seems all exhausting. I wish my parents would take me to boarding school. I guess we don't have the money to go to some prestiegeous prep school. I have to go to the public high school of Harrison. Seems like a very different society than Norman's. Gosh I miss him. I wish I could go to his house right now, and eat some instant pizza like they always had, and stay in his MESSY room, and watch movies on direct TV. Oh that was the life. I'm fine with the life I live now, I just wish some memories would just come true, if only for a day. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to memorize my speech. I have paragraph one down, paragraph 2 down too. I need to get paragraph 3 down. Also, there are many upcoming projects that I might be buisy on, but I shall make it my duty to report my thoughts to this site (which is my journal by the way). So I guess that sums up my weekend. As those 2 days passed by, my life is getting shorter. I must vow to do something productive!
<br />Well, that's it.
<br />Bye;)
