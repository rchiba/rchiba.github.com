Asking myself questions like, "Why the fuck? Are you really that fucking retarded?" generally doesn't improve my mood after looking at my any sort of math test.<br /><br />Luckily, I have lunch with Tif right after the period. It all slowly washes away. Over the dull salads and greasy fries, the talking releases something. But I'm still afraid. Why? I don't know. So, I pull deeper on the rope that's attached to whatever I'm afraid of. I still can't see it. I tug. More rope. Something far, far into the abyss.  <br /><br />The tense atmosphere re-establishes itself in French. I heavily dislike that class now.<br /><br />Unfinished, but this lack of goal. It gets to your head.
