I rediscovered the wonders of compressing files today. I'm so glad there is free software that gets the job done. Thank you 7-zip! <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">[LINK]</a><br /><br />Anyways, the State Fair was all fine and dandy, and from what everyone tells me, I'll be able to catch up easily. I've got lots of photos (one of the main reasons I went), and I happened to be elected (unofficially) as the IT Captain of the team. I don't know how that'll play out, but it isn't much of an accomplishment since we have so few people on the team itself (there were three captain positions and four willing candidates). Whatever happens, I'll probably end up doing the newsletter and a big part of the animation this year. I would like to re-emphasize the importance of recruiting more members this year. <br /><br />My computer is humming and making loud noises due to how CPU-intensive ultra compressing a file is.<br /><br />I'm not going to write more because my computer may crash any second now.
