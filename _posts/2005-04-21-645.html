My hate for these "Xangas" grows even stronger because Devin has turned to them. How devilishly evil!<br /><br />Anyways, I plan on making a movie about obesity and OLC. It's going to be a bit of a mocking of the whole class, but disguised in an informative promotional video for cardiology. I'm sure you don't care so I'll stop talking about it.<br /><br />Tomorrow is my birthday. I assume that you don't care about that either.<br /><br />Now, on to rant about how "Xangas" are evil. First of all, "Xanga" starts with a "X." A lot of things that are evil start with X. "X-Rays" are EVIL! They cause cancer and damage cell structure from inside out. You don't feel the damage caused until the cancer has spread throughout your whole body, the tumors are practically falling out of your nose, and your brain is being crushed by pressure from the increased cranial fluid. Perhaps it isn't EXACTLY like that, but let's think about another thing that is evil that starts with the letter "X." <br /><br />"Xenophobe" starts with X. They are constantly fearful of foriegners. Trust me, I've met a few, and they are either violent or reclusive. The latter would be better if you were me. Personally, I prefer not to be lynched.<br /><br />"XTRA" starts with X. It is used to lure unsuspecting consumers into a buying trap. Whether it be "XTRA POWER", "XTRA ACTION", or "XTRA JELLY", "XTRA" has led many people into buying insanely worthless objects. "XTRA" is truely evil.<br /><br />"X-Files" starts with X. It's such a crappy show that I'll just end it at that.<br /><br />"X-Men" starts with X. They aren't evil, but instead awesomely cool. But, you have to admit that Wolverine's sideburns have a hint of evil in them. I can smell the evil in his sideburns. SMELL THEM!<br /><br />"XOXOXOXO" starts with X. It has been used to conclude hundreds of thousands of middle school love letters. Unfortunately, these immature romantic escapades usually ended up futile and these X's and O's which were supposed to represent hugs and kisses only brought misery and dispair. I would consider that evil.<br /><br />"Sharper Image Ionic Breeze" starts with X. Actually, it doesn't, but it is so evil that it qualifies for this list. It claims to "purify" your air by ionizing the air, but it just produces O3, or ozone which can irritate the lungs of the people STUPID enough to buy those things. Serves them right. Stupid Ionic Breeze.<br /><br />Now, do you see the true evil of "Xangas"? They start with X.
