It's a battlefield. SAT scores.<br /><br />Spent the day hassling other people about it. Having myself hassled over it. Found out that my score is lowest of my peers. Don't want to care about it, but on the inside, I still feel a little empty. And it's arrogant to want so badly to be better than everyone else, but who can help it? The whole compare-scores-with-your-friends thing, although essential, does nothing but complicate the situation. The top-scorer tries to console everyone else, everyone else attempts to justify their failure, the lowest-scorer forces everyone else to shove off. Feelings getting hurt, and you can already tell how separate we all are.<br /><br />Sure, we're all friends today, but in a few years? It's scary to think about being torn away from a comfortable situation. And having to fend for one's self. Away from quality assurance and 100% guarantees. Away from pals that cover your back.<br /><br />Then, I'm going to realize how alone I am.<br /><br />Feelings, feelings, feelings.<br /><br />Why can't there just be a middle ground where I can live? Like a slice of toast. Somewhere simple. Tired of shifting my eyes and feeling ashamed. Tired of having positive moments crushed. Mistakes. Never any right choices, or uplifting, inspiring events. Just myself screwing up.<br /><br />I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore. I bet I have never known. I should leave it all behind on the weekend. Stop pretending. Straighten out. Stop screwing up.
