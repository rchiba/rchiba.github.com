James Kim, a senior editor at CNET, has died: <a href="http://news.com.com/James+Kim+found+deceased/2100-1028_3-6141498.html?tag=cnetfd.ld1">[LINK]</a><br /><br />Since my first discovery of <a href="http://www.cnet.com/">CNET</a> a few years ago, I've been using their video reviews to help me decide on various electronics purchases. Often, James Kim would be the one on the screen, explaining and demonstrating the various positives and shortfalls of a given product for my benefit. He was the one who wrote reviews I read, the one who was always on top of the bleeding edge in consumer technology. He died of hypothermia from walking in the snow, trying to find help for his family inside of a snow-stranded car.<br /><br />So, Mr. Kim won't be on the screen anymore. And it's weird imagining such a person dying. Behind the poor-quality, streaming videos, he didn't seem to be very mortal. To me, he was the sheltered, protected being whose mission it was to show off the latest trends in electronics. He was beyond death, and I could have been certain that he would have remained there, like a picture-perfect memory, on the website forevermore. He would be the old book that would never disappear from the shelf, the text no different read one day than the next. For an eternity he would write and speak to me from his desk. Unchanging, as constant as a hunk of rock.<br /><br />Being reminded that everyone's a person: a living, breathing, thinking, self-motivated, passionate, self-replicating, individual person. Now, that's something I feast my mind on.
