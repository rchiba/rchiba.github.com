Ten minutes at a time. Ten minutes at a time. I have to take my work ten minutes at a time or else I would surely go insane.<br /><br />How much more of this will I last? I'm dehydrated, my skin is damaged from the sun, but I'm getting paid. The money makes it all better. I draw a little something on the back of the pool log. Kids are breaking the rules, and I question my ability to enforce them. The wind blows and an umbrella tips over. Everything is ordinary.<br /><br />Back in the days of old, when I swam in swimming pools for recreational value, I promised myself that I would never enforce the irrational health department rules that were imposed on me. The circumstances changed slightly when I started earning cash for doning these things. Enforcing "the law", or so a certain someone said.<br /><br />I work the morning shift tomorrow. I'm tired. Just ten more minutes.
