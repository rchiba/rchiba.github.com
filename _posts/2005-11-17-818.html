I find slight humor in the trends that apply to the taking of tests. Well, at least in my schedule, tests seem to come in giant waves of ultimate destuction and doom. For example, tomorrow will mark the day that I take 5 tests. And of course, because I got home late because of a QuizBowl match today, I have not studied adequately for these five tests. Thus, I theorize that my grades will falter in the coming days because of the situation I am in now. If I stay up and do some hardcore studying, I won't be awake enough to even take the tests, but if I do not do any more studying, the grades I get on the tests will seem like I haven't even taken them. It's quite a hopeless situation, but my gut instincts usually keep my test scores higher than they should be.<br /><br />French, AlgebraII, World History, English, and Personal Law. These tests.<br /><br />And you know what? I feel not so fantastic.<br /><br />By the time you know it, I'll be in a mental institution.<br /><br />Until then, I'll manage.
