Hey blog-thing. My parents are wasted, like usual. I think I'm depressed a little mor ethan usual. Been consuming no calorie popsicals for a while now. Probably gonna break out. I don't care. I'm so disapointed with my parents. I hope they have hangovers....sorry that is mean but it is how I am feeling right now. Talk later.
