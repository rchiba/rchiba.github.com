*Note to self: "From Halifax to Hallandale" sounds like a good title for something.<br /><br />Anyways, I have started to uncover the joys of doodling on my pocket pc. I have almost mastered the gradient tools and am now working on the "carbon pen" feature.<br /><br />Well, in one of my classes today, my friend was being egged on by some punk kid who I don't even know (he's new to the school) to poke me. I was about to explode, but I remembered my core rules for jerks. Number one rule would have to be to never give in and make a scene like they want you to. Zach seems to defy this rule whenever he has the chance, which makes him a poor candidate for jobs such as, "hostage negotiator," and "heavy alcoholic gambler." Anyways, my supposed "friend" just keeps poking me and I keep asking him to stop. I stare that punk kid I don't know down. He smiles back. I stare him down some more. He tries to ignore me by looking at some undisclosed object in the distance. I decide to back down. I suppose he has had enough. My "friend" pokes me again. I am about to explode, so I defy my rule and loudly exclaim, "Troy, do you LIKE touching me or something?" which is supposed to have innuendo which translates into something like, "Troy, do you enjoy being homosexual?" He stops and threatens to stab me next time. Great friends, eh?<br /><br />By the way, I heard one of the most hilarious conversations I have ever witnessed on the bus today. These two girls were discussing the advantages of "smoking" (Smoking what, I don't know) over "drinking" (most likely an alcoholic mixture of some sort.) It was hilarious because they sounded so serious in their discussion. I suppose that's what the masses of prolateriat talk about all day. Heh heh.
