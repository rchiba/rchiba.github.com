Today, I spent a few hours working on an electrical circuit for a physics project. After many hotglue-to-flesh burns, it was time to test it with batteries. So, I put the batteries in. No lights. Much sadness.<br /><br />It's due in a week. And I've got chemistry things that I haven't finished that are due this week. Two tests tomorrow. Mother wants me to get tutored in math. It seems like thieves have taken off with my peace. Now, it's war. The whole thing's backwards. Busy, busy. Everyone is busy, but I still feel alone. Personal emails are getting shorter and less personal. I'm nervous. Can't sleep. When I'm happy in front of other people, I feel like I'm lying. To myself and to them. The things I say to myself don't improve the situation.<br /><br />I hope tomorrow makes it better, not worse.<br /><br />A summary of today:<br /><br />Pros<br />-I'm not dead.<br /><br />Cons<br />-I spent a few hours on the first six questions of the Chemistry worksheet. Then, I stared at problem #7 for half an hour. Gave up on the problem. I have over ten more problems left. Due at an unknown (but soon) date.<br />-Physics project is still unfinished.<br />-I still don't understand how to calculate resistance, potential difference, current, and capacitance. The test is on Tuesday. I'm very worried.<br />-Tiffany hasn't replied to my email. I've been checking all day.<br />-My room is a mess of tangled wire, assorted cutting utensils, paper, markers, cardboard, dried glue, and christmas tree lights. All for nothing.<br />-I'm frustrated with myself for not having studied earlier for my two tests tomorrow.<br />-I'm frustrated with myself for not being more diligent about getting my chemistry homework done.<br />-I'm frustrated with myself for not finishing my physics project.<br />-I'm frustrated with myself for not understanding schoolwork.<br />-I'm frustrated with myself for not finishing my SAT essay.<br /><br />All in all, today was great. Lots of sunshine, light, puffy clouds, and a gentle breeze. So I can't blame the day. I'm the one that's a disappointing failure.
