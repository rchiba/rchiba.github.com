I'm tired.<br /><br />It's been weeks since I've had real sleep. I can really say that now, since I had robotics last weekend too.<br /><br />I've been assigned to talk to some important people about FIRST Robotics (so they will donate lots of money). I figured that I better accept the fact that I'm going to fail miserably now, so that when I do, I won't feel as horrible.<br /><br />My furry fandom speech is coming along just fantastically. I managed to find the odd CSI and MTV video clips featuring their portrayals of this fandom. I'm thankful to find such clippings, as one would figure that such obscure video clips would be difficult to obtain. <br /><br />I can't think.<br /><br />Hopefully, my mental situation will improve with another jolt of carbonated beverage tomorrow morning.
