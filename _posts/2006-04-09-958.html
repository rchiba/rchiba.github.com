Every weekday morning is eerily the same. <br /><br />My lamp timer flicks the lights on at 5:00AM, about 45 minutes before I wake up. Then at 5:30AM, my clock radio starts to slowly fade in, tuned to the local NPR/Jazz station. Fifteen minutes after my clock radio awakes, I do. With a fuzzy mind, I manage to listen to the morning NPR daily news. I hardly understand the messages they tell me, but the droning of human voices helps to wake me up. Sometimes I hear a few broken sentences, and I can piece together the events going on around the world. But, these thoughts never last more than thirty seconds. Instead, they fade away as the next new sentence or news story captures my dwindling attention. Trying to understand the news is a great way to wake the mind. <br /><br />And so this continues until it is 5:55AM. At that moment, not a minute before, not a minute after, I stand up from my bed, and start walking circles. Occasionally, I sit down in my couch and stare at the floor. But, I keep myself from staying in one place for too long, or else I'll fall back asleep. So, I walk to the couch, and then to the desk, and back to the bed to check the time. Like a raving lunatic, a paranoid monstrosity, I walk circles, more of a triangle in all actuality, in my room for those five minutes, waiting for the clocks to turn to 6:00AM.<br /><br />At 6:00AM, the lamp timer turns off and the room is enveloped in total and  complete darkness. The only thing that even remotely lights the room are the glowing blue digits of my alarm clock. When the lights go out, I know I must leave the room. I have a fear of the darkness, and so my lamp timer acts as an automated fear stimuli by painting my room black at 6. Frantically groping around my room like a madman, I eventually find my backpack as well as my graphing calculator. I escape the terror of my room in less than thirty seconds past six.<br /><br />That is how I start my day. That is how I will start my day tomorrow.<br /><br />It scares me, the fear of an electricity outage. If there were to be no electricity, I wouldn't even be able to awake from my sleep properly. It really makes me think about the exceedingly important role modern electrical power, a less than two-century-old invention, plays in <b>virtually everything</b>. Y2K demonstrated how important computers are, but what are computers but hunks of plastic and metal without electricity?<br /><br />I still don't understand how I get to sleep every night with <b>my fear of dark places</b>.
