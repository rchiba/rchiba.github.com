My facination with adhesive substances has not ceased. <br /><br />And I'm not talking about sniffing glue.<br /><br />My walls, they are covered in tape, if only to hold up all the paper I have attached to the wall. The corners and edges of my desk are continuously assaulted by sticky notes, and I have six rolls of dollar store tape staring me right in the face. My desk drawers contain countless other rolls of double sided, photography, super-stick, duct, scotch, and colored tape. In my room, there is no where you can turn and not find tape somewhere or another. I use tape to keep things in place, I use tape to attach individual objects together, I use tape to organize, and I use tape to decorate. I'm living in a tape world, and I'm sure that it's a fire hazard by now.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if my obsession with electronics, tape, and paper killed me. Quite simply, it would be easy for a spark from my *many* outlets (thank you, power strips) to come in contact with tape, or paper. Upon which the room would burst into flames and kill me in my sleep, or while typing up a post. If I look down at my feet, I see a power strip resting on top of a bunch of crumpled paper. What a wonderful place for a fire to start. My good friend OSHA would definitely not be proud.<br /><br />In other news, school is getting closer. But, I don't really care anymore since I got to go to the local store and went on a shopping spree. <br /><br />Mind you, I bought a notebook and a pair of sunglasses.<br /><br />Due to my utter imbecility, I now have a 1.2 minute recording of me dancing around my room in sunglasses. <br /><br />Wow, I really did put those sunglasses to use, didn't I?
