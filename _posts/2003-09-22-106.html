Hello, back from school again. 
<br />We don't have any short term homework, but loaded with long reports. I have already finished my english composition which was a piece of cake, but is due Friday. It is imperative that I start working on the Arnold Swarganegger(however you spell it) report. That is due sometime in October. Ryan, my long time compatriot on the bus has decided to make a webpage. Unfortunately, with his dad's fire wall, his work has been degraded to sub-par soup fairy stuff. He really needs to work on it, and I'm the man to help. I'm goin over to his house on friday, and it's gonna be fun fun friday. I can't wait. I have all these ideas for my SIA website, but am wondering if it is worth the time. I am also planning to make a large balloon out of plastic bags and a tea candle. I hope it works. Anyways, thats all I have to say for now. Be sure to click those links that are on the site to go to Ryan's page. Thats all for now
<br />TATA;)
