I wasn't able to post last night because I fell asleep at 6pm and didn't wake up until the next morning. I wasn't able to write in any of my journals either, and for that I am in regret.<br /><br />What are my words worth anyway? For how many people read them, they're worthless. Some are worth more than others, yes. But, on average they are worth nothing. It's a matter of time-put-in vs. time-spent-read. It takes me fractions of a second to type each word, and some of them aren't read anyway. It makes me want to clean up this mess of text and do something worthwhile with my time. But, hey, I have to remind myself often. I have to remind myself now. I'm doing this only for myself. It helps me get rid of stress. That's all.<br /><br />And so I'm making animation CD's for my robotics team. They're filled up to the brim (687MB out of 700MB) with animation .exe files, .blend files, .avi files, and .html files. Lots and lots of files to help the budding animator. The people on the team think I know so much. Truthfully, I've barely scratched the surface in my attempt to learn animation. I haven't mastered nodes, am still a very poor character animator, and should really learn 3ds Max. I don't like it when people think that I'm more than who I am. It makes me feel fake and plastic. I want to be a living, breathing, real person. <br /><br />Spent this morning making video tutorials. After listening to them, I realized how different sounding I am than what I hear in my head. The voice coming to the computer was familiar, but I couldn't see how it was me. I had Ryan come over and listen to the sound clip and he told me that it was a very accurate recording. It's odd to me how this foreign voice is the voice that I send to my friends and other people through my mouth. <br /><br />I had fun at Best Buy pretending to not know English. My nationality makes it especially easy to do this. I got a few weird glances, but otherwise, I found out that most Americans are polite to their foreign neighbors.
