Asians seem to be all the rage on the Disney Channel. I don't personally watch these sad, hollow cartoons, but I often do see tidbits of them while flipping through channels. Through these tidbits, I see that Disney is extensively using stereotypes to appeal to children. Unfortunately, these stereotypes are highly misleading. <br /><br />Most Asians do NOT worship dragons, nor affiliate with them in any sort of ceremonial procession. Most Asians do NOT have wise white-goateed grandfathers who spit back philosophical nonsense whenever you ask them something. Most Asians do NOT have pink highlights. Most Asians are NOT rebellious and crazed. Most Asians do NOT have the last name "Lee." Most Asians do NOT have demented/crazy parents who are "weird" so to speak. Most Asians do NOT eat Asian cuisine for EVERY meal. Most Asians are NOT socially outcast losers. Most Asians are NOT arch enemies with blond cheerleaders. Most Asians do NOT know amazing martial art tricks. Most Asians can NOT turn into dragons. Most Asians do NOT fight evil villains in their spare time.<br /><br />Obviously, Disney has overlooked these facts. Disney is good at this kind of stuff because they have to be. I mean, they've been working with the government to produce propaganda for years. Isn't that why they are so popular with the American public?
