The previous day's inspiration turned mushy overnight. The same thoughts, the same doubts, the same insecurities, the same nonsense that keeps corrupting my head every day.<br /><br />And so, I went home, and thought about fundraising.<br /><br />And I waited, for an hour, sitting in my room, doing math homework, staring out the window, and at my pencil, listening to some jazz...<br /><br />I was pondering if I should go out into the cold and sell these overpriced pastries to complete strangers, in exchange for a spot on the Robotics Team. And I sat and pondered for an hour. The multiple analog clocks in my room tick and I become acutely aware that time is passing me by, and all I'm doing is sitting in my room thinking about something. <br /><br />And I thought to myself, "Even the greatest of people cannot get things done if all they do is think of them."<br /><br />So, I grabbed the order form, snatched my jacket, and was out the door as fast as you can say, "ripoff frozen pastries".<br /><br />I walked, with my feet, and moved through space with only skin to protect my hands. A big mistake. Over time, perhaps say 30 minutes, my hands became red. This was no ordinary red, but a strange shade of red that facinates the eyes, a skin so oddly... well, odd... that it mystifies the one who is looking at the skin. That is, until you feel the sharp, pain and then the throbbing dull pain that follows such facination.<br /><br />I dismissed it and trudged on. <br /><br />The things I do for acceptance, sheesh!<br /><br />And I walk and I walk, more like hobble. Wheezing, I make it to some random house that I've passed hundreds of times in my life, but never took the time to meet the people inside. I ring the doorbell. Too cold to be nervous, I wait for a few minutes. No one answers. I wait some more. After all, you never know what's going on in these houses. Perhaps the occupants of this house have some sort of religious ceremony going on in there, or maybe a cannibalistic sacrifice, or maybe drug dealing...<br /><br />Who knows?<br /><br />Anyways, after about 2 minutes pass, I get fed up with people not answering my call for money, and I run home. More like trudge. And the hardest thing about it was that the faster I ran home, the colder it felt because of the wind.<br /><br />After what seems to be hours, days, weeks, years of diligent trudging, I make it home. I run into the living room and collapse. I have a conversation with the carpet while my mind regains control over my body. My hands are still that strange red color, and now my face is that color as well. The skin exposed to the wind starts to feel tingly, then stings. I still haven't regained control.<br /><br />In the end, I sold 9 of these frozen pastries. Was it all worth it? <br /><br />Who knows?
