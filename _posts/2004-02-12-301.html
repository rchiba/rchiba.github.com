I guess nothing is happening this week except that darned barn dancing.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />I was looking into this website that has lots of occupations and tons of details about them at http://icpac.indiana.edu . I found that a trash collector (garbageman) only got a dollar less in pay per hour than a news reporter! Isn't that interesting? Anyway, there were a ton of weird jobs that I wouldn't care less about like rocksplitting, appraisers, and salespeople. It is a huge mess of jobs. Anyways, I have 2 tests today that are going to be hard, but I know that I am going to do well in them because I am going to practice optimism. Actually, I'm a bit nervous but the bus is going to be here any minuite, so I can't do anything but hope and be optimistic. There isn't anything happening today, but I wish something would go on so I could talk more here. My bus is here.
<br />
<br />Bye
