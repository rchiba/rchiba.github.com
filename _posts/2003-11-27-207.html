They Average Yo has woken up.
<br />Last night, I watched a very freaky movie in a vary familiar setting. I reccomend it to you if you want a good movie to watch. It is set in Japan and is called "Suicide Club". It is very freaky. There are TONS of people suiciding and the police are trying to figure out why. It has a GREAT storyline , but a bit too much blood. But who doesn't like blood? Also, it has alot of ways to suicide, a bit odd, but very memorable. If you want a nice long memorable movie to watch, you should watch Suicide Club. It is also called Suicide Circle.

<br />Anyways, it is Thanksgiving. Gobble, Gobble. There is much preparation to do on Thanksgiving. Of course, usually (at other peoples houses) people have lots of family over. But, of course, my relatives live across the world, and in their parts of the world, Thanksgiving is nonexistant.

<br />Yesterday I was angry at Devin because I did all the work and we all screwed up. Mr. Schnep gave us a B. It was the lowest grade in the class. Now Isn't that depressing. I hate how everyone got better than me and we had the most worktime/creativity. IDIOTS! But, who cares, I DO!!!! Who cares? I DOOOO!!!!! Anyways, It isn't snowing anymore, it is just very cold. I had a very weird dream. See, I was at this large swimming pool. There was a ledge near the swimming pool. My sister wanted to jump from that ledge, but I told her it was dangerous so she didn't. Then this blonde, male, about 8, bragged that he would jump from that ledge. Then he did. He splattered onto the ground and that was the end of the dream. I think it had something to do with the movie. It wasn't a scary dream, because that kid deserved it. I think I felt a bit of satisfaction as the kid splattered.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I think that movie had an impact on me or something. Anyways, I emailed my math teacher my answer to a large problem. He said the first one to do it would get pudding. I hope I get the pudding. I love pudding.
