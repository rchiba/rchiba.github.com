It's one of those times when you're on the computer for the most of the day, but you don't seem to be able to blog. One link leads you to a freeware program, which leads you to a spyware, which you have to uninstall, which gets you to another link that leads you to an mp3 stash, etc., etc. I've gone on a freeware downloading spree that has gone quite well. I've figured out how to get local and up-to-date radar/satellite data via my ipaq. Very handy...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I've spent alot of time configuring my wireless network, but unfortunately my wi-fi reciever has not arrived. I'm faithfully awaiting that fedex man to come to my door. I would have preferred a UPS man though. I lean toward UPS for shipping, based on previous experience. They deliver faster and more reliably than fedex and the like. Come on fedex, catch up already!
<br />
<br />Today is going to be one of the last clear days of the season. Outside is pristine blue, yellow, red, and orange. The last, nice fall day. And I'm sitting here in front of my computer typing this up. Sad.
<br />
<br />Now, let's talk about school. I sit at a table of 4. All the "cool" nerds sit at this other table. This "other" table is always packed, sometimes people are even standing around this table. I have yet to be able to infiltrate this table. My purpose is to sit with my friends and chat. My current table involves little discussion or even semi-logical talk. The usual conversations at this table usually involve vulgar descriptions of random people, insults, and talk about exploding things. It really disturbs me. I think Joe has veered off course a bit. I wish he would stop talking about gliders and boats. If that's his passion, that's great, but instead of talking to me about it, he should go build one. I mean, he also wants to be a game designer. He doesn't even know what goes into making a game. You can't just pour out ideas and get paid for it. It takes hard work. He should understand that before going and charging into unknown territory. I still want to be friends with him, but it still bothers me sometimes.

<br />I'll probably upload some pictures soon. I hope you enjoy them if I do.
