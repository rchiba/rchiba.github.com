Hello average yo here,
<br />Anyways, today I got some informative imput. An anonymous source told me about some stuimuli Alpha leader #1 has invoked upon the public. In other words, she's been spreading rumors by bending my words again. Like I said, yoiu don't have to come to this site if you don't want to, alpha leader #1. Enter at your own risk. Anyways, like I said, words are like paper clips. People bend them, then gouge my eyes out with them. This causes much unneeded torment. I did a little test on my friend on the bus today. I told him about how I brought my Palm Pilot to school. I was nice and let him toy around with it. I told him to not tell anyone. He didn't throughout school. Then came the bus ride home. He told Meagan even though I instructed him not to. 
<br />Conclusion: Ryan is not to be trusted with sensitive information.
<br />
<br />Anyways, today was good and dandy untill 7th period. I acted really stupid and I feel guilty. It is an emotion however, and emotions are obsolete.
<br />I feel destroyed, and my morale is at an all time low. I guess Alpha Leader #1 suceeded today, but tomorow is up to the variables that be...
