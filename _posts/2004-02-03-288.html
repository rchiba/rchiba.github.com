Hello everyone.  First I'd like to say...HI! Amanda! lol.  The reason I haven't been writing lately is because I haven't had anything to write about.  My life isn't NEARLY as complex(i'm not sure how to put that) as Amanda's and Ryo's.  My life is just like any other day, nothing new.  But now I have something to write about...
<br />
<br />Today we went over to Harrison High School to get a tour and get told some things.  Also, we got these forms we have to fill out were we put sown the classes we want to take and what diploma we are going for.  I've kinda got an idea of what classes I'm taking but I still have to go over it some more.  I have to be careful of what I choose because I'm going for the best diploma, the Academic Honors Diploma.  I have to get at least 47 credits to get it and maintain a "C" average.  There are so many things I can do.  Well, that's all I can think of to write so seeya.
