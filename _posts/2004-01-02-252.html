Oh dear blog-thing if I hear so much as another set of atrocious noises I will scream!
<br />over-reacting? Let's see YOU try sitting here listening to a simply disgusting display of animalistic noises. I swear, first she coughs without covering her mouth sending spit and germs flying everywhere, but now it's with this horrid sniff, sniff, sniff, slurp! and down the snot goes! Ugh... It is going to make me sick, sick, sick, sick! I'm trying not to complain, honestly I am, but dear Ra, L-Sama, and any other name you can give to the greater entity above, I'm near my wit's end! My goodness.. So...So...Repulsive...
<br />ok, let's try and ignore it again...
<br />Anyways. My sister's over here in one of her little moods. She has chosen the slappy happy world of depression today. Her past time this evening was slicing off lady bug heads and impaling their bodies in her room at her Dad's! Tell me, isn't that just <em>lovely</em>? *strained smile*
<br />Right, right.. pushing on through I've had a nice day chatting on the internet, had lots of laughs that I did. My stomach doesn't hurt too much and I'm sure I'll be less sarcastic and forgiving in the morning.
