I have been informed by my pen-pal Pete (say that fast ten times), an animator friend I met at an off-season robotics competition, that this year's animation competition for robotics is going to be downscaled. <span style="font-style: italic;">Greatly</span> downscaled.<br /><blockquote>The Autodesk Visualization Award winner will also be announced at the FIRST Championship. There will <span style="font-weight: bold;">no longer be regional Autodesk Visualization Awards.</span><br />Please note that there will <span style="font-weight: bold;">no longer be an Honorable Mention or Rookie winner</span>.<br /><a href="http://firstbase.autodesk.com/?nd=competition">-http://firstbase.autodesk.com/?nd=competition</a><br /><br /></blockquote><a href="http://firstbase.autodesk.com/?nd=competition"></a>So, you might ask, "<span style="font-style: italic;">How big is the impact?" </span>Well, picture this: There are exactly 37 regional events around the world each year. In previous years, 3 awards for animation were given at each regional. Do the math: <span style="font-style: italic;">3*37=<span style="font-weight: bold;">111</span>.</span> That's one hundred and eleven awards being consolidated into a single award. Animators around the world just lost 111 chances for recognition, 111 trophies, 111 moments of pride and fame in front of an audience. People work for weeks on these animations. And now they get what? Nothing. The chance of a team winning that single award is virtually zilch. There goes the motivation, there goes the community. Yeah, <span style="font-style: italic;">thanks </span>Autodesk and FIRST. For shitting us out.<br /><br />Oh well... You can't win everything. And if the powers that be are going to work against me, then well, there's no point in complaining.<br /><br />In other news, the school's energies have become more harmonious, as evidenced by the sharp nosedive of my French grade and the noticible increase in my math grade. Things are now where they always were, in their natural state of equilibrium.<br /><br />Homework. Yeah, I've got to do it. But, before I leave, please memorize the everlasting motto: "lol".<br />Those three letters mean so much, and so little.<br />So, laugh a little. Please, for the children.<br /><blockquote></blockquote>
