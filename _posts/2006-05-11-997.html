An hour ago, I was sitting in my high school's auditorium at my last band concert.<br /><br />Sitting through an event that I knew was my last one made me think. It's the same kind of feeling I got on the last day of diving, or the last day of middle school. An end of an era, and end to a phase, for better or for worse. I would like to believe that my choice is for the better, although fate will decide on that. <br /><br />The spring concert usually has pop music, rather than the usual classical fare. As such, Disney music was the theme this year. Having been a Disney-dependent child, the music stirred up some old emotions and memories that I didn't remember I still harbored. The music was very powerful, and images from my past were vividly illustrated by these seemingly random, yet somehow systematic combinations of frequencies.<br /><br />Could the same emotion be conveyed through machines? I am sure that it is entirely possible to mechanically emulate a concert band through machines that "play" the instruments just as humans do. <br /><br />So, if machines played the music perfectly, would the music still hold the same meaning? <br /><br />One could argue that because the machines, mechanical slaves, play the instruments, the music lacks the "human essence" of music that makes it so appealing. <br /><br />But, aren't the machines also a product of love? A product of dreams and hard work, science and technology? <br /><br />Depending on how one looks at the situation, one could even consider the people sitting in those chairs on the stage, nimbly moving their practiced fingers, mentally focusing on the small ovals that dot the page, one could consider these people to be just pawns, slaves, to the composer of the music. They themselves become the paper that holds the musical notes and key signatures. <br /><br />I guess that's what being a musician is being all about. Method of conveyance.<br /><br />The odd thing about musicians is that if they don't compose music, they become neither producer nor consumer. They're the middleman that serves as the connection between the two. <br /><br />As I watched the senior band members, and a few of my peers win awards a couple of hours ago, I finally understood why I jumped ship and abandoned the band program.
