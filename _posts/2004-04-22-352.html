April 15 as my last updation?!
<br />Wow, now I'm feeling guilty. This is the first week I have gone all out and worked every second I've had at home (I did play a little gunbound). Oh yea, Average Yo reporting,
<br />Anyways, Devin is always cutting in line and I'm thinking of making a website called, "The List". Just a black and white site with the names of people who I've seen first-hand do minor injustices at school. But, who would care? I'm just a no body without any attention.
<br />
<br />Oh yea, I forgot to mention that today is my birthday. I almost forgot. This is the first birthday with my bloggie. I think im 14 or something. I don't really pay attention to my birthday anymore. While all those people have extravagant birthday parties I live a humble life. It makes me feel special. Plus, I would rather enjoy my birthday alone than with friends. I mean, that's the kind of person I am. Who knows what would happen if I invited more than 2 friends over. I think that would be apocalypse, not that I'm christian or anything. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I watched the last "Matrix" movie on DVD last night. It was pretty good. I was thinking of making a movie about a hamster and his diet pepsi in animation. I was just thinking, this hamster could go have an adventure to find the famous "Diet Pepsi". I don't know though. Through past experience, I have learned that you should have a script before starting on movies. hehehe...
