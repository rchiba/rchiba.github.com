After much summarization, analysis, and quote-finding from chapters of Moby Dick, I have exhausted my time. I better get to sleep, and fast.<br /><br />Tomorrow is a new day, and I don't expect to get any work done due to certain QuizBowl tournaments (in which I am more of a spectator than a competitor, due to an extreme knowledge deficit).<br /><br />But, speaking of my Moby Dick assignment, I haven't finished it. It's a time-hogging piece of work. Spent 3+ hours and I have 40% of it done. The combination of personal inefficiency (I read very slowly) and what I'm reading (I read Moby Dick very, very, <i>very</i> slowly)<br /><br />You see, that's what I hate about assignments that carry over to Sunday. I end up worrying about them all weekend. The task seems so much heavier when it's been lugged around for 24 hours. And it weighs in on you, always on the back of your mind, always fretting over <i>when</i> it'll get done, <i>if</i> it'll get done.
