Ok, I just looked at my guest book and it is full, and I'm like OMG. 
<br />Hey you peoples, I never said anything about suicide people, hey, and I realize that you are probably at a slumber party or something, but dont feel sorry for me. Then I feel like a nerdy little wimp dude. OK people. I bet tony told you or maybe ryan, or probably melinda. These spying pricks, dont feel sorry for me please, ok? Ryan told me that like mental hospital people haul you in and lock you in if you say stuff about suicide so keep it low ok??? I don't want Mrs. Kerr feeling sorry for me. Now that would truly be sad, so peace out, and keep it low, Im undercover...
