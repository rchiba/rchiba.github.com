Today was one of those dismal days.<br /><br />The kind of day where one gets into a shower and tries to forget the day even happened. The kind of day where one feels like a worthless sack of old potatoes. <br /><br />I'm really feeling like a worthless sack of potatoes today. I've been working all day, for projects that aren't even worth all that many points. I've been studying for tests that never are there, yet when they do come up, I fail miserably on them. I'm trying to understand my math and chemistry, but all I can do in my horrible state of mind is haphazardly turn pages and stare at pages with glazed eyes. Tonight, breathing comes with a dull pain that I assume is from all of my pointless stress. I can't concentrate, but I'm having trouble sleeping because of my incessant paranoia of school. School means French and Chemistry. French and Chemistry mean feelings of shame, failure, and teenage anguish. School is every day of my life, even the weekends now. So, now my life is filled with miserable sensations of failure. <br /><br />And I continue wonder about how the end of a gun would taste, or how much 2 liters of blood really is, but I can't help it. <br /><br />Dismal, dismal, dismal. That's what life was, is, and will be.<br /><br />For now at least.
