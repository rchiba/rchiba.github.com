Driving home from the first "real" robotics meeting, all I could think was: "<span style="font-style: italic;">Damn. The radio is already playing jazz.</span>"<br /><br />Jazz means it's past 9pm. Past 9pm means that I better hurry and sleep.<br /><br />So, the robotics season has started. So will school. It's an overwhelming but justified venture, I think. Working as a team is hard. I feel socially retarded sometimes. With me, talking gets awkward fast.<br /><br />That's life. It's not Walgreens, that's for sure. But hey, with nothing else to complain about, I'm in good shape.<br /><br />This feeling. Being busy enough to not be able to stop and think about it all. Bad, good? Like I said, I can't even let myself stop and think about how bad or good it is.  Just, let it happen.
