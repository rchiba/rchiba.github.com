This is ryo again... 
<br />Anyways, Justin, if your reading this, I'm sorry. Truly am sir! Ok, let me explain,...I forgot because I had to go to the gym right after your email and I forgot when I came back. I REALLY don't want you to leave, but if you really want to, you can. It's no big deal. Just as long as you put a link to me and I'll put a link toward your site. It's your choice...

<br />Anyways, guess what?! 
<br />I did something very unexpected! I laid an egg,  just kidding. But... I did win 1st place at the speech meet. Woo hooo!!!! I actually did something. Ok, that's enough. Anyways, It is sunday, so I'll be expecting to veg out on the couch today. My legs don't respond because I went to the gym yesterday. I'll just be sitting this out...
