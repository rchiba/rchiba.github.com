My sister got me a "Mary Kate and Ashley" portable CD player today, and I'm excited. I've needed an old-skool CD player of my own for quite some time. It's great that I can finally listen to music without worrying about file corruption and battery drainage.<br /><br />Anyways, I spent much of my lunch period talking to this girl and how to deal with this supposed "lesbian" who sits behind us during band. This "lesbian" comes up to her and touches her.<br /><br />I suppose I've studied this "lesbian" and I can see that she is not really a "lesbian" at all. She just wants attention. She is as unintelligent as a dog, only caring about attention and social status. It's disgusting, but there are people like that. The girl I was talking to at lunch suggested that to solve this problem, she should make a scene and get angry. I suggested to politely ask this "lesbian" attention-sucker to move away. If this was not to work, I suggested to contact a teacher or administrator promptly. She stood her ground and said that getting angry would adequately solve her problem. This is wrong. Making a scene is precisely what that "lesbian" wants. She is probably being pressured by her peers to provoke other people. I reasoned, she is the enemy, so you do not want her to get what she wants. Therefore, my method would be the correct route to take. Again, she suggested that getting angry was the best way to go. Some people just can't see that anger solves nothing. <br /><br />Amanda and I were talking to lunch at school also (wow, I'm talking with many females. Does that make me persay, "cool?" I cringe when I hear that word.) and she told me rumors that were about me. Silly rumors. Silly rumors that made me laugh. Supposedly, in these silly rumors, I "frenched" (Whatever this means, I suppose it refers to "french kissing" which isn't actually French, so 'tis incorrect and therefore invalid) Amanda and that's how she got sick. Hilarious!<br /><br />Anyways, I'm heading out to South Carolina over the week. I won't be able to update, so chill for a week. I'll be back on Tuesday. Oh yes, kudos to Joe for taking care of the birds!
