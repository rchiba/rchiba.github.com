It bothers me how lay people are idealistic about hydrogen fuel.<br /><br />The hydrogen fuel economy will never work because of a simple law. No, not Mr. Thompson again, he's a simple lawyer. This law is actually the first law of thermodynamics. The conservation of energy. To create hydrogen to perpetuate such a future society, enormous ammounts of energy are needed to produce hydrogen via electrolysis. Yes, hydrogen powered vehicles are clean, only produce a byproduct of water, and are probably less smelly than conventional cars, but it'll take the same ammount of energy to run your car than before. It'll just be concentrated more heavily in certain areas. I believe coal power plants will churn out soot for many years to come. The huge hullabaloo over GM's and others' new hydrogen car prototypes does not demonstrate the manufacturer's ability to be clean. It demonstrates how they can manipulate the public into thinking this or that car manufacturer is cleaner. <br /><br />The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Association estimates that 25,000 people die of starvation every day. If we continue to spend so much effort on this "War On Terrorism" and continue to push more important priorities aside, I believe there is absolutely no chance that this kind of society can count on itself to have enough effort to generate a reliable alternative energy source. <br /><br />A terrorist kills 1,000 people in a spectacular train or plane crash every quarter of the year or so. The same thing happens 25 times every day. But, everyone in the industrialized world agrees. <em>We</em> are better than <em>them</em>. <em>We</em> must protect <em>our</em> things. <em>They</em> can deal with <em>their</em> problems. How can society tolerate starvation, but not Michael Jackson, a plane crash, or a dirty Earth? It's simple. We are better than them, or so <em>we</em> say.
