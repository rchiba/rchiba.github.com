Last night, it snowed a bit more.
<br />This is the Average Yo. Anyways, people at school are very hard to satisfy. They complain they complain and complain some more. During the first half of school, the kids complained about how the school wasn’t cancelled. Then when the superintendent did an early dismissal, the kids complained that 30 minuites early bus dismissal did nothing. These children should be educated in the ways of humbleness and continuity. These people really annoy me. I say that I want to go to school, and I am FORCED to give an explaination. I think that I should be able to want to go to school without being CONSTANTLY called weird. Let me let all my rage out: I want these people to suffer before being terminated and slowly roasted over searing coals then have their skin slowly peeled off with a cheese grater and have their eyes slowly drained and their appendages slowly removed. I want these people to burn, then freeze, then burn some more. I want them to know only pure pain. I want their nerves to be constantly full of electrical pain. I want their lives full of misery and sorrow for forever eternity and forever again. I want these people to sit there like vegetables as they suffer in a slow and agonizing pain and anguish. I want… many things, but most of all is for these people to understand.
<br />
<br />I try to help them by getting into the proper routine (doing homework, etc.) but this stimulus is NEVER accepted by these monkeys. My conclusion is that I am here to help no person ever accomplish anything. My goal now is to make these people’s lives miserable. 
<br />
<br />My thought on this whole going to school issue, is that if kids don’t want to go to school, they shouldn’t. Let them grow obese, and die. That means more college slots for me and more opportunities, and more influence. If these people stayed home like they want to, they would grow dumb and ignorant… and PERFECT for manipulation. People are already being manipulate, so how hard is it to manipulate a MIDDLE SCHOOL DROPOUT? I guess that if these people don’t accept the education they are endowed with, they should stay home and stay ignorant, and stay vegetables. I don’t really care if they RUIN their lives. My purpose now IS to ruin their lives so let them stay home and rot in an eternal pool of misery and torment. I wish for them to move to the LOWEST of the rungs of the corporate ladder and hope them an eternal life working at a fast food restaurant, factory, or in a shoe company.
<br />
<br />Alas, if only I had influence, things would be much different.
