I suppose all fares well today. 
<br />
<br />I got a free towel thing from Greg, my diving coach, today. I'm really glad about that. I guess that really brightened my day. Also, I used open-office today, which made me feel like a 1337 open-sourcer. That spruced up my day too.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I'm still griping about the fact that I don't get to build a computer, but I am glad that my dad got a DVD drive to put in my computer that will enable it to rip videos. That is, if I can install it correctly.
<br />
<br />According to some people who read this website (I didn't know people even cared about me), I have been too cynical of myself. Well, I have been quite cynical and pessimistic lately, but that's what makes my write interesting things. That's what this whole blog is about. It's about unvented rage, depression, and sometimes subtle feelings. 
<br />
<br />My classmates in the hallway walk extremely slow. It's like they are supposedly walking, but everything seems to crawl along. I can start to smell the sick, dastardly fumes from the perfume someone is wearing. I can't stand it. If people could just walk a bit faster, and a bit more focused, there wouldn't be a need for detentions and tardys. I hate slow walkers. It really gets to me. Maybe they can't help it, but just make a lane for slow walkers. Like a slow lane where anyone who wants to take it slow can go. It's just so annoying, and it clogs up the school.
<br />
<br />Also, in French, we had a birthday. That usually means sweets. The birthday girl brought this cake. It was neon pink colored and was supposedly "chocolate". I'm not saying the cake was bad or anything, but America is seriously obsessed with brightly colored, sugar-dense, highly processed foods, especially sweets. It bothers me that people put such a price on sugar and caffine. They are addicted, and they are puppets controlled by those who manufacture such drugs. That gets to me too. The french teacher said that the birthday-sweet giving would have to stop. She said she had a weight problem. The question is, why can't she just resist the urge to eat the sugar? Why couldn't she just not eat the food that is brought? Is this society so impulsive? So "I'm not going to blame myself for my problems"-ish? It disturbs me. There was this overweight child in the locker room after I was done diving. He said, "I wan't to go home and eat candy". Obviously, this child has some problems. With his weight, he shouldn't be eating unhealty foods, nonetheless candy! It's outrageous. He's probably going to get fatter if he doesn't do something about it. What a society this is. Sugar and Caffine power it, and Fats and Cholesterol destroy it. What a world.
