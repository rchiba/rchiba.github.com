I was complaining to Ryan at the pool today. Complaining about how I have to go to the State Fair tomorrow with the Robotics team, thus missing a day of school.<br /><br />When I do anything, I must visualize myself doing it first. Without visualizing it enough, I get frustrated, confused, and disoriented. I'm someone who likes for everything to follow a script. Even when I show even a hint of spontaneity, it's simulated. They are planned out somewhere in advance, in my head somewhere, even if I don't know it. I have to do familiar things.<br /><br />So, when Logan called me up and told me that I would be missing the school day tomorrow, I got a little frustrated. For me to get comfortably adjusted with missing a whole day of school would have taken a few days of visualization. A few days to accept the fact that I'll be doing something uncomfortable and unpleasant, making a sacrifice for something I am involved in. I mean, a whole day is a lot to me. Seven classes of work to make up when I get back. Seven individual classes, each with seven different families of possible handouts, projects, essays, tests, labs, you name it. And to have to familiarize myself with that in a matter of hours.<br /><br />It is, how do you say... difficult.<br /><br />People have been talking about challenges all day. How these classes will be challenging, how it isn't going to be like last year. Well, I guess juggling Robotics into my life will be one of those big challenges. I must like suffering. That's it.<br /><br />But, it's a program that I don't want to die. I feel like I'm sort of a big part of it now, and I don't want to contribute to its failure. I spent too much time last year on this thing for it to all fall apart this year. It's life changing. I'll take the responsibility and take the unpleasantness of missing a day of school, if only to help contribute to the secure future of Robotics at William Henry Harrison High School. And if it does end up falling apart, then so be it. I'll walk away with no guilt knowing that I tried my best. <br /><br />I'll be waking up nice and early tomorrow to go to Indianapolis. I'll be coming home nice and late tomorrow as well, at around sunset. It's a full day occasion, I'm assuming. <br /><br />And I guess it's a great way to start up a <i>challenging</i> school year.
