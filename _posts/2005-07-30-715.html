I hate it when I have to go into a topic that's actually being discussed and debated. A topic that, as of now, has no official answer, but a logical one. One that some people might disagree on. The subject pertains to violence and nudity in video games, and crackpot Miami attorney Jack Thompson. And don't forget about Hilary Clinton. <br /><br />Everyone who's even caught a glimpse of a news medium has seen it. People walking into game stores all over the nations have been horrified to find their favorite American past time to be missing from store shelves. Recalled all over the US, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas has been tagged as hazardous to our children. It's almost as absurd as Pope Benedict considering Harry Potter a possible threat to Christianity. <br /><br />And the absurdity of it all is the timing. <br /><br />The first game came out ages ago with carjacking, prostitutes, drugs, gang warfare, copicide, and other various articles of crime. Now, on the seventh GTA game, politicians and their evil little demons (lawyers) decide to go bonkers about some obscure sex scene that requires a code to unlock. The shots have been fired and here come the lawyers. Suing for pixelated sex scenes? What's next? The graphics are so poor anyways that you can't tell if the guy is just dancing or trying to do a backflip. Yes, if you have a nipple that consists of a pixel that's slightly darker than the pixels around it, then you know this isn't hi-res, youth-corrupting material. <br /><br />And the hullaballoo results in A RATING CHANGE! What, now you have to be 18 to buy the game? How old did you have to be to buy the game before? SEVENTEEN! That's a one year difference. I'm sure all of those 17 and a half year olds were mentally traumatized and forever scarred when they saw two poorly shaded and modeled collections of polygons rythmically moving back and forth. What kind of kid doesn't know what sex is by the age of 17?! The only person I can think of is Karl Rove. Michael Jackson is another story.<br /><br />So, after almost a decade of playing a game, let's finally ban it because of a few flesh colored pixels moving about! Yes, forget about the copicide and drugs. We politicians tolerate that nonsense. But, DON'T YOU REALIZE!? A SEX SCENE!<br /><br />Let's all go to Mr. Thompson's website, www.stopkill.com, and protest his retarded greedyness. Power to gamers!
