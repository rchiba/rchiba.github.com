Well, all week I concealed my mistake, so I guess that's an accomplishment. Charlene didn't come over, that's relieving as I am very tired, and I finally got around to figuring out my web site, which is also cool. I set up one with angelfire to host my stories and stuff, it's pretty interesting and I am SO liking my new story, 'To Love A Demon'. It's quite interesting. I think Ryo would like it because of the situations and stuff. If Ryo is reading this, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!!! I need to figure out some war techniques and stuff and I think you might know something I don't, and that is good, because I need cool battle moves and stuff. Anyway, besides that I am really tired. I had a really long day. School seemed dreadfully slow, especially choir. Anyway, g'day all!
