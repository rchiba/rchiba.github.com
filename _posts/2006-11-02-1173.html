The robotics meeting today was a personal failure for me. It was like <i>always</i>. <br /><br />The inefficient, unproductive meeting involved the sociable stupid people dragging everyone else down, software problems (which resulted in a total of 2 training-usable computers, and drab powerpoints. I was disappointed to find this meeting unimportant. I should have seen it coming. <br /><br />Or perhaps it was efficient and productive. It's just that I chose to stay out and model objects with my peers. <br /><br />I hate it when it's late, late at night. There are things to do, things that aren't really due, but personal affairs that need to be taken care of. No, not those personal affairs. Personal affairs like drawing a quick sketch of that beautiful cartoon panel, or writing a paragraph or two here and there. And it adds up, it eats up time.<br /><br />I should be getting to sleep. Fridays are always significant, right?
