Besides Second Lifing, adding more art to my gallery, and running errands, I discovered papercrafting.<br /><br />Papercrafting is when you take a piece of paper and print a template on it that you follow. Add glue and hours of meticulous paper folding, and you get a paper model. I think it's really neat. I suppose I think it's neat because it's free. The instructions told me to use cardstock, but I used normal paper and just barely managed to get the tank I was building to look like a tank. It looks rough around the edges and bent/deformed, but otherwise I think it looks like a tank. Well, even if this doesn't turn out to become a big hobby of mine, at least I found a use for my decorative high school license plate. Now I use it as a cutting board. It works quite well.<br /><br />What else happened today? Well, people started commenting on my art, randomly, today. This one guy even told me that my style was good. I was very excited about that comment. I don't know why insignificant comments like that make me so estatic. It's like I'm obsessed with how others think of me. What I really need is to refocus my priorities. I should be focused on the joy drawing brings me, not the comments that come from the images. It's idiotic to be obsessed with comments, when the joy of creation is at stake. I mean, what's the point of obsessing over what others think of you when everyone is just going to die? The important thing is contributing to society. Contribution is much more important than recognition. That's why the existance of celebrities is so depressing. All of them will be forgotten in a century, and if they are remembered, they will most likely be parodied or ridiculed. <br /><br />Contribute, so when you die you will not feel worthless. Existance is a privilege. Use it.
