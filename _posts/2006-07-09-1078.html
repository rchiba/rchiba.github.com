My computer keyboard feels slightly sticky from the sweat on my fingers. My hot, humid evenings (no air conditioner in my room) are dedicated to writing things at my desk. Three main things must be accomplished every night. Those things are typing posts on this u, writing and replying to emails (of the lengthy kind), and writing in my personal composition notebook. Two of those things require the keyboard. <br /><br />It's mindboggling to think of the data transmission that has gone through this keyboard. Words from my mind, converted into binary chunks of data, shown as text, sent to servers all over the world. To think, at the moment this keyboard is the only link I have between you and I. It is how I talk to you, convince you, perhaps insult you, and at times encourage you. These keys, how they have been pressed to produce sequences of letters to form words. These shapes, so abstract, but to the trained mind, they contain massive amounts of data. I'm fascinated by the fact that there was a time before the written word, and I'm even more fascinated by the fact that there <i>is</i> written word. And why I have five fingers, and how five plus five equals ten. And how ten is a two digit number. How petroleum was used to make this textured, black plastic that makes up my keyboard. How your mind is looking at these oddly shaped lines and taking meaning from them. And how you interpret this meaning.<br /><br />Text is difficult. Metaphors and similes, personification, simple wordplay. There is no "tone" or "pitch" to be analyzed in text. No facial expressions to accompany the "hey, wazzup"s and the "I love you"s. This is what makes text so difficult. To convey the meaning you intend, it takes extra effort not to confuse. But, always, there is means for misinterpretation. A critical failing point of the written word.<br /><br />So why keep typing? With so many flaws, why does text exist? <br /><br />Written word is easy to preserve. And although words may not be the most sincere, surefire way to communicate, it can be shared, kept, copied, created, modified, and analyzed as long as people know how to read and write. It's economical. It's intellectual. It's the past, present, and future.<br /><br />I'm waving back at the past while zooming into the future. And in my mind I wonder how I've come so far, and how far I'll go. How far I'll keep typing.<br /><br />An unfortunate thing it would be to have my hands destroyed. It would be as if I had no mouth anymore.
