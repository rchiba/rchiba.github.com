The place I volunteer at was hectic. I tell you, it's an act of superhuman multitasking to be able to volunteer there. <br /><br />The situation is relatively calm for the first two hours. Tasks are manageable. I'm given a stack of worksheets to grade, and I can grade at my own pace, occasionally helping someone with a math or reading problem. <br /><br />The last two hours are when things start to pick up steam. Older kids, with more homework, more problems, more issues, more complexity, and more attitude start to come in. At the same time, a large amount of very young children enter. These are the kids who you have to dedicate a lot of attention to, because they're learning to read and such. I figure, if you mess 'em up young, you mess 'em up forever. So, I try not to do anything stupid while interacting with the little ones. All the older kids (most of them) think I'm worthless, but they ask me questions anyways. During the last hour, a consistent stream of slackers who have three weeks worth of homework rush in and turn their folders in. This results in a pile of papers to grade, which coincides with the peak of traffic. <br /><br />Grading two stacks of papers, teaching a kid to say "fort" instead of "foat", reading and trying to find a series of equation possibilities for a hyperbola, ignoring a screaming/crying kid behind you, and timing all the exercises with a stopwatch, all at the same time. For an hour and a half. It's straight dope, it'll get in your head and tear you apart. I'm sure the tip of my red pen was hot by the end of the first hour. But, I suppose I'm slowly learning to cope with the difficulty of multitasking. <br /><br />My volunteer work is much more difficult than my paying job. Hoorah for situational irony.<br /><br />I finished my twenty volunteer hours to get my fancy diploma (which really isn't all that fancy) today, but I think I'll keep coming to the place until the end of this month. Why? Even I don't know. Maybe it's for the sake of routine, maybe it's because volunteering is my way of cutting myself, or maybe it's because I'm an egotistical jerk who wants to rack up volunteer hours to show off to peers. Either way, I'm in for another hectic four hours of "crazy children bonanza" this coming Thursday.
