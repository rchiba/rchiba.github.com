New Class Analysis: Very Easy
<br />
<br />I thought high school was hard. All we have to do is read some 4 page chapter, take some easy quiz, do it everyday, participate, and we get an A.
<br />
<br />Summer Gym 2 is like health. We get textbooks and learn about wellness. 
<br />
<br />Ok, we did physical testing today. When we got to my specialty, muscle endurance and strength, I got excited because this was where my 1 year of gym work would shine. First, Jon did push-ups. He was my partner. He did like 10 or something. Everyone else mostly dropped out at 20. Then it was my turn to do push-ups, and Jons turn to count. The CD monotonously went "up...down...up...down..." over and over and over. As usual, everyone dropped out at around 20. I kept going. When I got to 25, people were like, "woah" and "that kid is a freak!". At 30, I was shaking, but maintaining my compusure. I lost it at 34 and everyone probably felt inferior to me. Yay. I found out that I only weigh 118 lbs. Of course, the scales are probably extremely inaccurate. I didn't know they still used the manual weight scales. Those are obsolete beyond a doubt. I can't believe that doctors, schools, and other government agancies still use those crap scales. 
<br />
<br />Well, more Summer Gym 2 tomorow.
