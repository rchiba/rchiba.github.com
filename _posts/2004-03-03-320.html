Ungh.... hey blog-thing. Well, my last post was tramatizing. This one isn't bad i guess. I'm really angry at myself though I've been forgetting things far too easily. I forgot two asignments! TWO!
<br />Anyways, i just spent A LOT of time on an pciture. It's really, really cool looking. Its done in manga style. It shows everyone how i feel at the end of the day. Sorta. 
<br />Anyways, in school news.... there is none. 
<br />Anyway, cool thing of the day? I figured out a way to type/work and excercise at the same time. How? you might ask. Well, i dug out my sister's outdated laptop, figured out to convert my documents, and then rigged a platform on top of the tredmill and then, finally hooked up my laptop. I just turn them both on and walk and type. I got lots of work done today. Too tired to update anymore tonight, i haven't ben getting my sleep. Sorry. 
<br />~Amanda.
