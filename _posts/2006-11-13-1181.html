I look down at my watch, and all I can think to myself is,<br /><i>"It's still monday!?"</i><br /><br />I agree. I shouldn't expect time to move so fast, nor should I <i>want</i> time to move so fast. But, I can't help feeling rushed to jump through these hoops. Each day, there's some test, or other stressful item I'd rather get over with. During the day, most of my thoughts are directed toward the item in question. I focus and focus on this event that is insignificant in the whole scheme of things, and when I finally take the test, or turn in the paper, I'm presented with another project to think about. It's this complacent, obsessively <i>objective</i> lifestyle I'm living right now that is bothering me.<br /><br />It's as if I'm not alive, I'm just going through the motions so I can get through the day and move on to the next. I'll be doing that tomorrow because of the physics test, and the next day about my English paper, and then the next day a Chemistry lab. But, I don't want my life to be so chain-like. What can I do?<br /><br />It's my outlook. <i>That's it.</i> It's  how I'm viewing my assignments. I have to tell myself that I have to relax and be spontaneous. I must take the uncalculated risk, learn to accept failure, and figure out that it's alright to quit sometimes. Be smooth, <i>stop hitting yourself against the wall.</i> Be smooth.
