I enjoyed today. Or, I'm telling myself I enjoyed today so I won't regret this weekend.<br /><br />Even doing my physics homework was entertaining (to some extent). <br /><br />So now I'll go enjoy my life some more. I'll wake up tomorrow and enjoy my life. I'll do that for years and years until I die. And I'll die satisfied. Because, I got through it.
