Oppinions must be typed out. And I shall do that, later....
<br />Anyways, today was a buisy day with me going to speech practice and lego league and all. Our robot in lego league really is kinda dumb, but it works. In speech practice, I got a purple ribbon because I got 7 place out of 8, not bad, if I say so myself. Also, at the speech meet, Kelly and I made up a stupid poem that is hilarious, I dont know why.
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Jack Sprat laid on a cat
<br />The cat yowled and clawed his face off
<br />
<br />Jack Sprat fell in a vat
<br />And the cat left for Pittsburgh
<br />
<br />Jack sprat went into a chat....room
<br />and died of third deegree burns.
<br />The end!
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />Isn't that a hilarious poem? It's stupid, yet genius. Oh well, I need to start typing my oppinions up. Ok, well
<br />BYE;)
