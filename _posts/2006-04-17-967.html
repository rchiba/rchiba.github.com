There are little white strips of paper on my desk. <br /><br />On these rectangles are slightly faded lines, from an ink pen scribbling French words on them. They seem to be small note cards from long ago. And they sit there, perfectly in chaos. I don't know what makes it so visually pleasing, but I find their arrangement in harmony with my desk. The angles at which they stab each other, the way they hide under and over the other objects, the means by which they deploy themselves. Such a consummate placement.<br /><br />Next to the cards sits a few pens, three black ones, in fact. Markers, a cup full them in all sorts of vibrant colors, a pair of scissors, rulers, adhesive notes, tape. <br /><br />The tape seems so dejected. Forgotten. Although it does have purpose. I use it often, so I guess the tape can't feel so horrible. It has such a distinct aim, purpose for existence. I enjoy staring at that cheap plastic container with an opaque strip of adhesive. As pointless as its life appears, hidden under all of the pretty notecards, it has something so powerful and priceless. And I stare at the tape, and it makes me feel pointless all of a sudden. The tape is sitting on my desk so I can stick things to my wall. The tape didn't have spend its life training to become what it is, and the tape didn't have to make a decision about becoming tape. <br /><br />I stare at my desk often. It's just another of my inefficient habits, really. My desk reminds me of life. So diverse, and so mixed, and so... Apparently random, but not so underneath. The good times, the bad times. Memories of using the red ruler for making a Valentines card in elementary school. If you want to know, the card never reached its intended destination. A Rubiks cube that I never got to solve. Memories of disappointment, the realization that I lack comprehension in puzzles. The markers, they have such a friendly and inviting feel to them. I've used them so many times, the words on the side of the marker are starting to wear away. I have a little plastic plane that sits on a cheap plastic stand. The cheap stickers on it are starting to fade and crack. The aging plastic brings back memories of being far away in a foreign land. <br /><br />A spent "Hello Kitty" eraser sits on top of it all, like some gaudy reminder to get more erasers from the store. The little bunnies and flowers smile back at me. Fake smiles. Trying to improve my life by smiling at me, but in reality they mock me. The flowers, the bunnies, the kitty. They mock my complicated life. All they have to do is sit there on the plastic housing of the eraser, sit there and do nothing for an eternity. Eventually, they'll head to some obscure landfill to clog the Earth with more petroleum-based goods. So they can sit and smile a little farther from my desk, and a little closer to hell. <b>I never liked that eraser.</b><br /><br />The absurdity of it all. The absurdity of looking at my desk, at the random pile of my belongings sprawled out in chaos. Life, such a complicated thing, yet it can be compared to the simplest things. Or perhaps I'm looking too far into the bunches of inanimate objects that continue to multiply throughout my room. Multiply like the bunnies and flowers and Hello Kitties and other beings that constantly must ridicule me.
