Snow is in the forcast tomorow.;(
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />Anyways, tomorow is going to be frentic. It is going to be career day and that means skrewed up schedules and times. Also, I presented the "kingdom project" today. It went well and I am expecting an A. Most of the other groups were EXTREMELY unprepared and stupified with our and other groups great work. Anyways, if we have a 2 hour delay tomorow, that means that our whole schedule is skrewed up. This week is going to be confusing. 
<br />
<br />For band I have to memorize 12 scales. I memorized 3 then forgot. Stupid me, right? Well, I don't know if I can do it. I bet I can though. When I get my new in-line skates, I am going to go with my camera and go exporing new territory in Devin's neighboorhood. 
<br />
<br />I just successfully completed a wheel rotation on my dad's skates. Hopefully, the wheels will last longer now. I can't wait untill tomorow! Bye
