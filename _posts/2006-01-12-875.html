For the sake of me not going insane due to lack of sleep, I am going to post my speech. I know it's dishonorable to put up content on here that really isn't meant for such a personal medium, but I can hardly think of my French, nonetheless what to type up. Blah.<br /><br />My speech:<br />--------------------<br /><br /> Here begins the timeline of my life, Ryo Chiba. April 22, 1990 years after the birth of Christ. Date of death? Now, there's a question for you. Yes, one can surmise from the information given in the previous statement that my name is indeed Ryo Chiba, and that I am actually 15 years old today. But, is there anything more interesting to this faceless account of my sad, short existence? Well, for one thing, there is my computer.<br /><br /> From my activities at home, to a number of details that could be recorded as I traverse the world, one could even say that I detest human contact. Of course, this is not true. I just happen to prefer my sterile office chair in my tidy white room over “hanging out” as many call it. The origins of how I interpret “fun” and “comfort” are really just so obscure and unknown to recall. Thus, my interests mainly focus around activities that are meant for solitude. My natural habitat is in a chair in front of a computer. Now, hear me out. I am not a lazy person. Although appearances say otherwise, I find inactivity in any way utterly disgusting. I don't think I've turned on the television in my house in a few months.  I find no consolation in sitting around and doing nothing. Talking with me usually is useless because the conversation ends up being meaningless banter. Because I find inaction revolting, I find things to work on, such as homework and school-affiliated projects. I spend quite a bit of time mulling over various unfinished bits of paper that I sometimes pull from my binder. I spend such a considerable amount of time on homework that one could even call it a hobby of mine. I suppose that it's how I try to justify my obsession with work. I believe this says a lot about my character.<br /><br /> Everyone seems to want a funny story about me, but the truth is, I am a funny story. From my birth in Japan, to my childhood in Alabama, to this very introduction speech I am giving to you today in Indiana, my life has been scattered, to say the least. In addition to Alabama, I have traveled to countless cities in countless states. In geographic location of life, I have developed my own personality. If one was to judge “who” I was five years ago, it would be totally different than “who” I am now. I don't even know who I truly am. Thusly, I find it extremely important to record information that I deem significant, whether it be about myself, other people, or random ideas. I see analog methods of this dirty and physically tiring. Digital methods are tiring as well, but it's the only viable option available. In other words, I like to type. Ever since Monday, June 23, 2003, I have spent thirty minutes of mostly every day typing the information mentioned previously. To date, I have 860+ entries, numbering 500 pages of 10-point font, resting on a nice back-up floppy that I keep in my room. Amazingly, these thirty minutes a day have impacted my life greatly. In this time, I have improved my poor writing skills, increased my previously deficient vocabulary, and gained a certain amount of technical expertise. Although the previous statements sounded like a pitch by a drug representative, I have my defects. I still have trouble with simple math, due to my calculator dependency, and sometimes I can't annunciate words.<br /><br /> By peering into this large compilation of words, one could pry open my inner psyche, which I assume this is all about. The word, “me” crops up 134 times while the word “you” crops up 129 times. “Life” crops up 77 times while “death” and “suicide” crop up 20 times. From this pseudo-statistical analysis, one could speculate that I care about myself more than other people, and that I concentrate on life more than death. The true actuality of these statements is unknown, but it gives you an idea of who “I” seem to be.<br /><br /> Although this irksome summary of myself may not have left you in the proper mood, I hope that the speech was effective enough for some of you in the audience to begin to understand who I am. As for my date of death, that is information that I hope to never know.<br /><br /><br />Ta da.
