Yes, yes, yes...
<br />
<br />My mother has bought me a awesome briefcase that I shall cherish and be merry with. Tis a happy moment. Is it weird for a teenager to like briefcases?

<br />Anyways, Amanda gave me a pencil. A "happy easter" pencil. I can't believe she sacrificed a pencil for me. I'm truely grateful. It's a sincere gratefulness you can't deny. A "all hail the chosen one" kind of greatful. You know, you can't thank someone who you admire so much. I admire Amanda, and she gave me a pencil. Am I going insane, or is my world turning upside down?

<br />Anyways, I almost killed a swimmer at a practice on Friday. I jumped, and landed just centimeters from his neck. A potentially fatal blow was avioded by fate. I could have really paralyzed him, but luckily he has something important to do later in life. He was spared from my death blow by a variety of variables. If I had jumped just a hair differently, he would be terribly injured right now. I'm so very lucky, as he...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to sleep for tomorow. I have to cherish my easter bunny pencil. I have to fill my briefcase. I'll have to update you later.
<br />
<br />Goodnight.
