Today was another day of failure.<br /><br />After pestering Alex with questions on Gtalk for about three hours, I realized that it was hopeless, at least for today, to get my wiki to be accessed from the Internet. This morning, I had hope, as I configured Instiki to work, and for a time I was satisfied with what it could do. To my surprise, things worked. Computers on my network could access and edit the content. But, unfortunately, after rigorous testing, I figured out that it was not accessible from outside the network, which was a real bummer.<br /><br />So, like I mentioned above, Alex came to the rescue, but in the end, the wiki is still unavailable from the web.<br /><br />The URL is: http://192.168.0.102:2500/ , just for future reference, and so I can access it from my laptop upstairs. You won't be able to get to it.<br /><br />But, I did put lots of information in the wiki. Even if it isn't available from any computer in the world that's connected to the Internet, it's just as useful when it's only available on my network. Hopefully, the computer I'm hosting it on won't go kaboom, and will stay alive, just long enough so I can get tons of information in it, and back it up.<br /><br />Because of my lack of things to do, I also added 4 more pieces of "art" to my DeviantArt gallery, if you would like to check it out. *Note: The link as on the sidebar in the links menu. Hint, hint: "My Anthro Art".<br /><br />But, alas (I haven't said "alas" in a long while), a time for sleep is fast approaching, and I will have to bow down to the great powers of mortal limitations.<br /><br />In other words, I'm going to bed.
