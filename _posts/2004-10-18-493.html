Hey blogthing. Looks like yours truly, myself, gets to update more often now. Isn't that great? Sorry, I'm trying to be optimistic today. If you must know (or in other words, if I must tell...) I have been quite busy with soccer and my academics lately. I apologize first and foremost for not updating because of those reasons. But now that soccer season is over and I am out of commission, I get to update you on my life! Isn't that so much fun? ha, ha.
<br />Yes, I am bored out of my mind.
<br />Why, might you ask. Well, those particular Monday I was outvoted in my quest for going to school. I had to stay home. Why? Well, because I had a soccer tournament and almost every part of me is aching. We got second place, but at a price. Miss accident prone me tore either a ligament, a tendon, or a muscle. My friend's mom, who just so happens to be a doctor and was on hand, said it was probably one of those. Her claims are supported by my stepfather, Kurt. So, lucky me gets to be on crutches for a couple days, a week at most, and in recuperation for about two weeks. Yah...
<br />Excuse my lack of happiness, I'm hurting really bad right now. I can't believe how hard it is to live right now. I'm relying on people, and it annoys me that I'm not completely self-suficient anymore. I took for granted so many things... I feel so incompetent now. So callous and stupid with a capital S.
<br />But enough of my pity party. I'll try to update later with more news. Alright? Until then, wish me luck at school tomorrow! I really, REALLY hope I don't die...
<br />~Amanda
