Hello. The weekend has passed that is going to end all weekends. Or so to say, the "kingdom project". All has gone well and I think Devin, Karl, and I will do well.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />Anyways, after this week, I go to Savahna, Georgia. Very homely and warm place. Dang! I had like a billion ideas of what to write 5 MINUTES AGO, but I forgot! Ok, I have to try to remember them. While I'm thinking, I have to devise a way to store ideas quickly and efficiently and secretly (Pulling out my PDA in the middle of class isn't very secret, if you know what I mean). Oh well. Anyways, I have no idea of what to talk about, my head's blank, and I'm going to feel so stupid in a little bit because I am going to remember them. I can't. 
<br />
<br />My in-line skates are coming tomorow and I am challenging Devin to a race. I KNOW I can beat him. He thinks that a bike is faster than in-line skates, but I'll show him. Muhahahha, and if I lose, I'll just be a loser.  Who knows? He might win, I might win. The advantage of skates are that you get maximum instant accelleration while a bike takes a while to get to speed. A bike's advantage is that it's top speed is much higher.

<br />Anyways, school is soon so I should cut off now. I just HAVE to remember what I was supposed to talk about!
