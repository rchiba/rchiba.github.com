Tomorow is school.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />Anyways, I went to the mall yesterday to get new clothes. I was amazed at what I saw there. Everyone was obese and had rolls of fat. I can tell you, if I counted 10 random people at the mall, 9 of them would be overweight. It was pretty tough finding clothes that weren't size XXL. I mean, it was outrageous.
<br />
<br />Talking about XXL, I cleaned out my binder (or as they say in Indiana, Trapper Keeper) and the papers were monumental. Just exploding out. Crazy... I found some year old fruit snacks and shards of plastic, warped by my binder. My binder is finally in it's final resting place. In my desk. I might call it to attention someday. But other than that. The news is still school is tomorow.
