Fads are all around us. Remember that Numa Numa dance? So mainstream, and it faded away so fast. No one even cares to remember it anymore. But, one of my favorite fads are the Tamagotchi things. I absolutely love them. Personally, I've spent hours and hours feeding, playing, scolding, and talking to be Tamagotchi, until I lost it. It was a very sad day for me.<br /><br />The word "Tamagotchi" comes from the word, for egg in Japanese (tamago), and a ploy on the English word, "watch" pronounced in a Japanese accent (watchi). The "Tamagotchi" units were first introduced in 1996 and were a huge fad for a short time. 40 million were sold in less than a year. Because of their immense popularity, many schools banned the usage of Tamagotchis. <br /><br />There are three stage for Tamagotchis. Egg, child, teenager, and adult. You must feed, clean, dicipline, and play with your Tamagotchi.<br /><br />The different kinds of Tamagotchi in chronological order are: Tamagotchi Generation One, Tamagotchi Generation Two (American Release), Digimon Tamagotchi, Tamagotchi Angel, Mesutchi and Osutchi (Mating Tamagotchi), Tamagotchi Garden, Tamagotchi Water, Tamaotchi, Tamagotchi Devil, Easy Tamagotchi, Santaclautch (Santa Themed Tamagotchi, Genjinchi (Caveman Tamagotchi), Mothra Tamagotch (Mothra-Themed Tamagotchi, if you don't know who Mothra is, why don't you watch Godzilla?), Tamagotchi Plus, Tamagotchi ConneXtion (No, that's not a typo.)<br /><br />Picture Time! <br /><br /><img SRC="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Tamogotchi.jpg">
