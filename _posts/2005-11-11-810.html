Things to do this weekend:<br /><br />1. Worry.<br /><br />2. Be paranoid about chemistry class.<br /><br />3. Overcome my paranoia by living my Second Life.<br /><br />4. Feel guilty from being on the computer for so long.<br /><br />5. Try to overcome guilt by drawing.<br /><br />6. Feel disappointed from my crappy art.<br /><br />7. Think about chemistry class again.<br /><br />8. Worry.
