Newspaper class is an adventure. Journalism is the art of retelling a story using as few words as possible. To be concise, accurate, and easy to read. It makes sense. With all the millions of individual sheets of newspaper being printed on every day, every extra word is amplified to a problem. No one likes to waste ink. Dumb readers will get confused, newspaper businessmen lose money, and the editor has to work a little more. But, it's hard for me to think this way.<br /><br />There are things that must be explained, but the laws of journalism won't let them be. Concepts and ideas must be simplified to the bare roots, and then some more. Quotes have to get thrown away and details are lost in the constant battle to ballast another word or two. Right now, the idea of adhering to these restrictions is overwhelming. Sure, I type here every day, but that doesn't mean I'm a journalist. My sentences drag on, they're awkward. I focus on the details and lose the big picture sometimes. I screw up the sentence structures, put commas in inappropriate places, try to add emotion to what I write.<br /><br />But, journalism isn't about that. It's about strangling the emotion from a story until all that's left is a pale, unmoving carcass to paste on another bland newspaper layout. It's about collecting and compiling information from the environment. It's about para-para-paraphrasing. <br /><br />I can't see how I'll enjoy writing for the newspaper and I don't see how I was naive and stupid enough to ever believe that I would see newspaper class in a positive light. <br /><br />I guess it's just another challenge to take to the bank.<br /><br />The sun is setting and I'm done with my homework, so I'm happy with the progress. I don't want to admit it, but when I got stuck in something in my homework, I turned on my radio and started hitting my pillow with a book. I hit my head on my desk a few times, then went back to work. I'd have to say that it didn't help. <br /><br />I've got to find a way to disperse my stress. Who knows if it's eustress or distress? Really, where is the distinction made?!  Whatever the case, it's keeping me from doing things efficiently. Keeping me from living how I want to live. Sometimes writing just isn't enough.
