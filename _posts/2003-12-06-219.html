Today was the band feast/festival. It went terribly wrong, and I realised the truth. That many, many people are primitive minded. Woefully, I observed people's brains fizz out as their social escapades overloaded the truth. They, don't know how to shut up because they are just teenagers. Chemicals in their brains corrupting their systems. It is happening to me as I speak. I wish I was not cursed with these horomones, but of course, this is biologically the most efficient way to get the incentive to produce offspring. That is, of course, because the whole point of all of our existance it to make more of ourselves, and then die. All that job stuff, and the arts, are extracirricular. That's our role, and I accept the truth...
<br />
<br />Anyways, at the festival thingie, I had to wait tables. I waited 3 times as many tables as everyone else. I hope I networked correctly. Anyways, my feet are aching, and that is why I am sitting here pushing buttons on a keypad, like some mind-altered zombie. When I look at the computer screen, I feel dizzy, like i'm floating, or rolling out of control. It is a very odd feeling. I hope I don't get a seizure...
<br />
<br />Anyways, all the snow is dying and so are my feet.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have read amanda's post and it feels so, advantageous. I could bend the ways of proportion like a straw. It is just that I am stuck in semi-popularity. I must delve deeper into the cataclysmic tombs of the outcasts. I MUST. I cannot figure a way how though. I am being mean, of course. But, this is partialy because the chemicals in my brain are bending how my neurons work. I understand now, I understand. And yet, I try to share the information I am blessed with. No one seems to accept it. They will die, I will die, I care, they don't. They are oblivious to the impending fact of life. They seem as though they are meant for co-existance. They waste their time as idle manekins sitting in front of the Telivision. They ARE idle manekins. This is the time of their life, that many cherish the most, and they WASTE it on a BOX WITH LIGHTS? They could at least use it like I am. Letting my words ring free... even though no one will listen to me. 
<br />
<br />Well, tomorow I have to wait tables again. Yay.
