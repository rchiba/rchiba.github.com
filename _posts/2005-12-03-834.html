I suppose one could call it guilt.<br /><br />But guilt is more of a word than a feeling. I didn't go to a QuizBowl meet today because I was in no condition to answer random trivia. Although I know for a fact that me going to this meet would have caused more chaos than good, I still feel guilty. A bad, dark feeling of shame. That I failed my comrades that trudged out to the killing fields to bring back a trophy. I failed Zach especially. He spent every day this last week eagerly asking me if I was ready. I always responded to his pestering, but innocent questioning with an enthusiastic "yes". But, now that I think back to it all, all those times I replied to him with an enthusiastic cry of team spirit, I failed. The exuberance of the moments I've come in contact with my QuizBowl teammates, are now wasted away. Because of this stupid virus I have.<br /><br />The stupid virus that makes me wheeze, cough up mucus, and take medications to force me into a drug-induced stupor.<br /><br />It's infuriating to be guilty of something you couldn't have controlled. But, in reality I could have controlled it. Hygene, and viral vigilance could have been emphasized more last week, but it wasn't. And here I am, feeling miserable from my cold, and even more miserable from the undeniable guilt of not fulfilling an obligation to the things, and people I hold dear to me.<br /><br />This is what happens when one is not careful enough.
