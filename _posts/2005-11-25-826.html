Gee willikers...<br /><br />Today was a fun-work day. This means Black Friday shopping mania, going over to do a movie project, and making things in Blender.<br /><br />Well if you don't know about Blender already, I'll probably add a button link as soon as I get some sleep.<br /><br />I feel guilty, but I'm going to not write anymore on the basis that I'm sleep deprived.<br /><br />Deal with it.
