I know I should be studying for finals.<br /><br />But, it's so easy to procrastinate. So, very difficult to break out of this vegetativeness.<br /><br />You know what? I like it when I don't have anything to write here. Because it means that there isn't any drama in my life. Short paragraphs, meaningless posts, it means that I'm living life like I want to and that I'm feeling fine. It means I have nothing to get angry about, nothing to get sad about. And who wants to write when you're happy? You start to realize all those things you <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> have been doing while moping around.<br /><br />I think Mr. Chen, my guidance counselor, still thinks I'm suicidal. English teacher must have sent down some more of my essays or something. He looked genuinely worried.<br /><br />Too bad I'm not sad. I guess Mr. Chen won't have anything to find in me!
