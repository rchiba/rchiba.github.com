Hey blog-thing, surprise, surprise! Mom is drunk as heck again. I can feel my patience stretching, tearing, waiting for me to let go or break. I don't know how much more of this I can take. My sister went off the deep end again, on Monday she had the choice of going to jail or a hospital because she was insane. She's been in a hospital for a week and now she'd going to have to do drug rehab. Wanna know what she did? She went berserk, tore up Don's house, and stuck two butcher knives in the mantal. If Don had walked in she would have killed him. Oh, and, she cut herself. Don called the cops on her and they took her away in a handcuffs. Before that episode she tried to run away.... She can get marijuana anytime she wants from either Jenny or Don. And do people do anything about it? No. 
<br />Why is my life such a gosh darn mess? I know that answer-it has to be someone. Can I help still feeling trapped? That whole family, whose name I sadly and regretfully bear upon my shoulders, are like mobsters, or even a family drug ring! So many things, so many interesting stories, and I doubt anybody that can do away with it will listen. Lies, scandals...Oh the world I used to live in and am still struggling o completely break free of. But how can I do such a thing when Angela is suffering, and when even the smallest things remind me of that horrible time there?
