My life is tiring, even if I get home early because I don't have extracurricular activities.<br /><br />Today was a day like that. I didn't have any extracurricular activities. Wednesday is the only day off I really have. The weekends are reserved for English class projects and misc. homework studying and test review. All other days have an extracurricular activity and lots of homework. Wednesday is no exception for the ammount of homework I have, but I get back home two hours earlier than usual, which is fantastic. <br /><br />Fantastic until I realize how many things I have to do. Basically, I walk off of the bus, open the door to my house, eat a very early dinner, take a very early shower, trudge up the stairs, dragging my enormous, green backpack up with me, shut the door to my room, turn up the music in my room, do homework, and study. After schoolwork is done, I write my daily quota for NaNoWriMo and draw something. By the time I finish my drawing, it's usually 8:30PM and I'm ready to type up a post for this blog. I take a half hour doing that, and I sleep. <br /><br />Rinse and repeat for 365 days.<br /><br />And it continues, and I know it's going to get even tougher in the future. Like I mentioned earlier, yesterday or something, things will have to be sacrificed.<br /><br />I think that's really sad because I like doing everything I do (save the English class homework and projects) and I don't want to sacrifice anything, but I suppose that's how life is. Dreams will be shattered and protective walls will be knocked down. <br /><br />I'm exposed on all flanks as is, and what am I supposed to do? Stop writing and drawing? What would be the point in living if I did that? Stop all of my schoolwork? I can't do that, because then I'll end up being an second-class non-citizen. Stop my extracurriculars? Well, what will I put on my resume? Actually, it's not like I have a resume to put all of these things on. I'm not a citizen, so I can't work, so it's hopeless.<br /><br />Life without hope isn't life at all. So, I suppose the above statement, when I said, "it's hopeless" is false. <br /><br />At least, I hope it is.
