Hey blog-thing. This afternoon was horrible. And when I say horrible, I mean probably the worst thing I've ever documented on this site.
<br />This afternoon had had to see the Ping Woman...*pauses enough to scream die at a stick figure* And Don. It didn't go well. I went in there and well here;
<br />I remembering getting into he car, joking around a bit with mom and stuff but when we got to the clinic my heart and stomach were competing for victory in my throat. I was scared and angry and so.. well, it's hard to explain. Anyways, that annoying Ping woman came out all happy with her hair looking stupid, as if she had haphazardly crimped it when she was half asleep and before I knew it we were headed towards. The Room.
<br />Anyways, I had had a bad day so I guess I was projecting some pretty nasty vibes because I sat down and began drawing. Of course my nervous stystem had had enough this week and I started shaking right off the bat and I felt so horrible, like the world was spinning around and around and I was on top, suffering the worst of it. Anyways, we started off as usual, a calm question of the day and I snapped, said I was 'fine'. Ping woman when silent and then asked Don. Then the usual bull happened, except it was more intese. Before I knew it I was flooded with such emotion and I couldn't hold it back. The inevitable happened:I screamed.
<br />No, of course it wasn't a LOUD scream, it was more just some "I hate you"s and "burn in hell"s. The usual rot and all. Anyways, I felt so weak that I began to cry I couldn't stop! Couldn't stop crying or shaking,and it got to a point where, since I wouldn't act how they wanted I guess, they got too pissed and began saying stuff like 'its not working out' and 'I'll see you in court' crap. But then something hit m, and I'm afraid they could hold my mother in contempt! But, the thing is, they're the crackpots that called it off! They're the ones who upset me, and I didn't call it off, they did. And now, some time next week I'm gonna have to talk to a judge and go back to court. How bothersome >_<
<br />Anyways, i stormed out once the door was open and slammed the door on that Ping Woman and waited for my mom to coem back.
<br />Of cours,e then i lost it. I guess i had a small nervous breakdown and i began to say 'I'm sorry' over and pver again. And that is pretty much the gist of how the little 'Angel' of 8-year-old took over. Then, when i realized it was that side, immediatly i mixed a bit of the "Demon" and the "Halfling" and fortified my walls. Now I guess I'm ok. As long as i push it away for Sunny to help me get through later.
<br />However, it's hard, but I'm trying. I really am. *sigh* I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders, like Atals. I guess in many ways my three mental beings inside of me is true and that my life is just about as dramatic as a soap opera. Oh joy.
