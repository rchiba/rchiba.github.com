Its a great day, breezy,no clouds, and beutiful sunshine. I am going over to Joe's, and were gonna' have a great time! I cant wait. Its awesome weather for swimming and I guess the timing was just right. It is going to be sooooooooo awesome! YAY! 
<br />I havn't eaten breakfast and I am hungry. I just made a new webpage that is at tripod. I am still deciding which homepage I should keep and which to destroy. Or on the other hand, I could keep both. Oh well, decisions, decisions...
