I look at the watch and it's 8:30pm. So I dwaddle around on the computer for what seems like fifteen more minutes. I look down at my watch again. It's 11pm. <br /><br />As school approaches, it seems time, life, everything is speeding up. The tasks of future school workload, as well as the extracurricular workload, stare back at me from the farthest reaches of my mind.<br /><br />One may wonder why these thoughts are in the farthest reaches. Well, the sad truth is that I don't like school, or the work associated with it. Might as well run away and see how far I could make it. I mean, sometimes, I look out the window, wherever I am, and think of just abandoning everything I have and roughing it out in the wilderness. Or if you play runescape (you batty twits!), the wildy.<br /><br />Yes, it's irrational. But the thought keeps creeping up. And I've read stories about people who do just what I'm thinking of, so I know I'm not alone. What's life if there aren't any surprises? Why not just abandon the future and run for what exists right then and now? I can't make any definitive statements anymore. This whole "discovering who I am" thing is really tough. Finding out "who to be" in the future is just as hard. Career choices as well as lifestyle choices.<br /><br />They tell you to ask yourself, "What do you enjoy doing?"<br /><br />But to me, it sounds like, "Calculate the profit vs. enjoyment ratio of every career field in existance and compute the job that offers the highest possibly probability of success."<br /><br />This choice involves my life, and lots of people have set paths that they follow. I have a path, but I don't know where it points.<br /><br />The clock ticks, and with a loud buzz, my radio starts conking out again. This promptly ends the above discussion with myself. As I turn the knob to adjust frequencies, I ask myself the real question I've been meaning to ask myself this whole time,<br /><br />"Why am I here?"
