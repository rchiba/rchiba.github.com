Finals, finals, finals!<br /><br />It's zero hour, and everything is in a frenzied pace. The fated cram time has arrived! Students and teachers pace rooms all the same. Clocks spin, pencils slip, essays are hammered out. Cries of glee and annihilation. Complete annihilation.<br /><br />Odd that in a matter of days, it'll all be over. I'll be free to sleep without having to remember Eudora-what's-her-face and how to calculate enthalpy of reactions. Oh, won't it be splendid then...<br /><br />But, the thing is, it's not <span style="font-style:italic;">then</span> yet. It's now. And right now, I've got five finals.
