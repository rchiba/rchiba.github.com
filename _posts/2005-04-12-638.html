The ink in my precious pen is running out. It makes me not so happy. Without the pen ink, I won't be able to illustrate my light pencils, therefore rendering the contrasting emotions useless. A new pen will be needed, and soon.<br /><br />Guess what I spent an hour on tonight? I spent an hour drawing a 50's-esque drawing. Hehehe. I'm so productive, like I said before. <br /><br />Kaiser Andrew said that my animal-esque furry characters are obsolete compared to his human creations. And people reading my blog, I have not webcomic nor are planning to release one (Like anyone cares anyways). The flickr pictures were just experimental image hosting... experiments. Also, I suspect that Amanda read my blog. I also suspect that my sister could be possibly read my blog. I'll have to block my sister and become more censorship oriented, I guess.. Or not.<br /><br />Well, on to learn more about drawing!
