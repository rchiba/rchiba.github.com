Today was one of those days where one gets mad for no apparent reason at an innocent person. <br /><br />And so, I feel bad. I was very rash in what I said to this person, and I shouldn't have said what I did. I acted like an all-American firebrand. For my personal ego-boosting, I said what was in my mind at the time, and that was a horrible mistake. I sit here and smack my hand with my fist because I feel like such a terrible person. I've been what I've hated for the longest time, an elitist, egotistical, irrational jerk. And, the longer I think about it, the more I start to want to jump off of a high place.<br /><br />But, guess where I live. In an area that is very flat. The tallest thing I could probably get access to would most likely be my window. The fall would at the very most sprain my ankle. It's a jump from a second story window onto concrete. Even if I jumped head first, surviving would still be a possibilty. And sometimes, when I'm in class I think of running to the roof (3rd story) and jumping, just to freak out the kids in the social studies classes in the front of the school. These classes have big windows that show the whole front of the school, and I think it would be pretty darned hilarious if the class witnessed a body impacting the ground with a damp thud. The school corporation would have to go all out with the trauma counselors and everything. The media would have a party, and think of all of the messed up kids, thirty or so, maybe sixty if someone jumped right between two classes. Am I the only one who finds humor in this?<br /><br />Truthfully, I'm not suicidal, but I do find humor in morbidness. I figure it's either the desensitization from all of the gory images in medical journals or it's genetic, or perhaps a combination of the two. <br /><br />Back to the guilt trip I was taking earlier, but attempted to ignore because I'm such an narcissistic jerk. <br /><br />So I was riding in the car, and I was being hotheaded. I said things, perhaps not directly hostile, but in a manner that conveyed the anger that was not supposed to be expressed. And it continued for fifteen minutes. I drop the person off, still angry at some undefined object, and I go home.<br /><br />Later, I get to a restaurant and the server gives me a kid's menu. My rage from earlier is just growing. I look at the kid's menu.<br /><br />"Ages 10 and Under"<br /><br />And I think to myself, "What the fuck, I'm fifteen and these imbeciles give me a kid's menu?" <br /><br />For a few minutes, I use my creative imagination to not-so-tastefully envisage a scene in which I beat the server to a bloody pulp over and over again with some blunt object.<br /><br />It helps a bit.<br /><br />And I calm down after getting bored of imagining the server's massive head trauma.<br /><br />I pick up the glass of water and drink the whole thing, and get dizzy.<br /><br />It helps even more.<br /><br />But, I'm so inherently evil. Even now, I know I'm storing trace ammounts of that anger, and I know it's going to find one way or another to come back. <br /><br />This bothers me.
