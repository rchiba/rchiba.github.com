I don't have much time to escape from reality today since I took a last minute Target Superstore escapade. My mother and sister were looking at paper products, while I mingled with fat, fanboys and game-addict smokers in the electronics section. I naturally gravitated toward the cheap acessories aisle. I found some cheap headphones I wanted and seriously considered buying them. I factored in the value, use, and portability variables, and it made sense to buy them, but I pride myself on being paranoid on spending money. In the end, I didn't purchase anything. <br />Otherwise, I just grabbed a couple (couple meaning seven) AOL CD's and made my escape. <br /><br />Upon returning home, I grabbed the phone called Ryan, and afterwards started reading "Chicken Noodle Soup for the Teenage Soul II" that my sister rented from the library. I have no idea why my 10 year old sister is reading teenage sap stories, but isn't mystery the spice of life? Or is mystery more like the e. coli of life?<br /><br />I read through it and scanned through the boring sap stories. They usually have some sort of conflict between being "cool" and being a "dork." In the end, the main characters end up becoming "cool" or learning a lesson by living as a "dork."<br /><br />These books are misleading to the nth degree! Life isn't a handy-dandy snappy puzzle. It's like a random number generator. The laws of probability? Give me a break. The only law applicable in supposed "teenage" life is Murphy's.<br /><br />I hate it how everyone in this "Chicken Noodle" book has a happy ending. The writer for the book came to school once to give an inspirational speech. Many people kill themselves and never learn any lesson whether they are a "dork" or "cool" teenager. There are intelligent, caring popular people and dorks who are dumb jerks. I turn my nose up at such rubbishy stories. I find hope in life, not from these silly stories about how your problems will be solved by trudging through them, but from the inevitability of death. Why bother with these silly problems when you can just ignore them? No time to bother with problems.<br /><br />Silly stories. Someday I'll publish a book called, "Arsenic Soup for Sappy Teenagers."
