I was recently delighted to communicate to my old friend Kiran again. It was nice remembering childhood experiences and discussing how stupid our peers were. I hope we can talk again sometime.<br /><br />Anyways, tomorow is the field trip to a seminar and I can't wait. Also, I want to know if my Biology article will be acceptable to do my essay on. I'm not sure that it will be, and if it isn't I'll have to toil away trying to find more articles. At least I don't have diving. Good grief!
