Hello, the Journal and Courier got my email and called my mom. I wonder if they will publish, but that is unlikely considering that my mom told them that I am in middle school. If only I was a year older, in high school. That would greatly enhance my ability to be heard. I hope they don't publish my address for I know activists and people who really could sick their dogs on me. Anyways, they probably won't for it is too idealistic for them. They probably think I'm some conservative hippie that doesn't drink milk, but what do they know, media pigs. Today, I had a chat with ***coughalexicough*** Anyways, she is defending herself against my accusations of her tyranny. Oh well, I wonder who told her about my website. Probably those spying pricks in communications class. I guess I have to be more careful from spying pricks. They anger me so, but in a way, they calm me for now I know that there are alot more pricks in the world than I thought. I guess I just have to be a bit more paranoid. Paranoia is always settling, yes it is. For some reason, I like that show called "Gary the Rat". It's funny and I love how he is drawn. So sly, cunning, and surprisingly funny in a dull sort of way. Lol "My shotgun is literaly in the next room" Lol I love that quote. HAHAHA. Ok enough of that. Maybe I should put a link to Amanda's site of relentless souls. I'll do that. Ok, I think that is all. And people on my site, Vote On My Poll!
