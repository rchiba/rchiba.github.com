I am increasingly intimidated by my peers in QuizBowl. They are obviously more superiour to me. The "cut" will be initiated soon, and I know I will be one of the unfortunate that will be kicked out of the team. Maybe I'll be able to salvage relations at the Buffalo Wild Wings meeting on the West side of town. Hopefully, that will quell their urgency to kick me. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I studied studiously for my science test last night, and today I wasn't able to finish the test. All of my peers were able to, but not me. I feel alienated. Anyways, that was a very unfortunate turn of events, because I really want to get a good score on the test (who doesn't?) 
<br />
<br />I got Devin's advice and got some radiohead CD's, yay! I'm also looking in to purchase some ear plugs so I can block sound out of my head at certain times where it will be crucial to do so (Yard Work, ISTEPS, etc.) Anyways, I've been researching about that lately, but I don't have the time to do so. I've got 10 minutes to finish my research, try to memorize a ton of math postulates, and post this rant.
<br />
<br />Ok, I don't have time. I will maybe bring my camera in tomorow to take pictures, but that's if the weather is good. I heard Greenville, ALA took the brunt of the storm. I hope my pals there are still alive. I'll call them sometime. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I'm running low on time (aren't I always?) so I have to part with you. Now I only have 5 minutes to study my math. Just great. I better stop ranting and say good night. GOOD NIGHT.
