Updates galore, and the webmastas happy...
<br />No updates at all, and the webmastas gonna torch anyone in sight...
<br />Anyways, Yesterday night, I put a bunch of leaves in my pumpkin, and lit them. It was very cool. Now my pumpkin is a charred mess on the inside, but on the other hand, the pumpkin looks the same on the outside. I think everyone should try it. I mean, It's going to rot anyways, so why not use it as a fire pit??? 
<br />            Anyways, ( I CANT STOP SAYING ANYWAYS!) the idiotic morons , (nothing personally, im just describing your inner thought and reason system in your brain,) in gym class are very unnerving... but I have a very nice way to prove them wrong.... I shall not tell you because..... THAT WOULD GIVE IT AWAY, IDIOT!!!!!!!!! Also, I have started doing my hair a different way. Now my hair goes back, kinda like elvis. I didn't want to waste time going to get a hair cut so I just combed it all back, and it stayed that way, nifty huh.... 
<br />            Anyways, (Sorry again....) I am going to a band festival thingie and I have a tie and all that stuff on that makes me look professional. I remember that one time in 6th grade that I wore fancy clothes to school... and everyone made fun of me. I think that is more civilized than wearing pants that go up to who knows where  and having your disgusting belly button showing all the time. I think these children should understand that they arent going to be hired by anyone with that kind of idealistic view of clothing....unless they work at limited too or something. I mean, PRACTICALLY EVERY GIRL I SEE IS BREAKING THE DRESS CODE. Just wear something over that skin!!! My eyes burn and mutate at the sight of that stuff. It's just plain disgusting. I makes me want to barf. I don't know about you, but I don't want that happening at our school...
<br />           O man, that paragraph was sooo  meant to be in the opinions page, oh well... Anyays, did anyone notice that the sign on top of the opinions page is misspelled? lol
<br />             Well, that's my life.....
<br />how's yours?....
<br />Bye....
