Zip codes? Who cares about those? You write them down in countless government forms and surveys at school. A zip code for about every piece of "on the record" material. State tests, and other nonsense always require a zip code.<br /><br />ZIP stands for "Zoning Improvement Plan" and this code was devised by the USPS (United States Postal Service, for those people like me who are dumb idiots and can't derive United States Postal Service from USPS) in the early 60's. Those crazed, psychedelic postal workers.<br /><br />Actually postal codes for large cities started appearing in 1943, but they weren't the five digit codes we have all grown to know and love.<br /><br />The "father" of ZIP codes was this dude called Robert Moon (No relation to Dr. Moon, that corrupt doctor of Redding, CA.) He came up with the first three digits of the zip code. The last two numbers are actually the old "postal codes" of 43'.<br /><br />In 67', they were required on second and third class bulk mailings, and slowly the ZIP code became standard for all mail. Then, the ZIP codes of the United States started devising a plan to take over the government with a military coup and turn the US we love into a totalitarian state, with ZIP codes at the head of power. Fortunately, it didn't happen quite like that.<br /><br />ZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of U.S. states, the second and third digits together representing a region in that group (or perhaps a large city), and the fourth and fifth digits representing more specific areas, such as small towns or regions of that city.<br /><br />The lowest ZIP codes are in the New England region, just in case if you have a contest with a friend to see if you can count your ZIP codes by region and you're betting your new bubble gun that you can count ZIP codes. You know, it could happen.<br /><br />Oh yes, we can't forget Mr. ZIP, the ZIP code mascot! He's a 60's/70's character (Psychedelic postal workers can sometimes come up with great ideas, remember that.)<br /><br /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/Mr_Zip.gif">
