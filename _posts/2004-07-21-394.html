Ok, there's this girl at summer gym.
<br />
<br />She was nervous/complaining/agonizing about how she was going to fail the test that we had to take today. By the way, these tests are just 15 multiple-choice questions. She just ranted on about how she was going to fail. After getting kind of annoyed, I inquired to why she was going to fail. She said that she didn't read the chapter. I was thinking to myself, "She didn't read the chapter... Well, even though the chapters are small and you would be stupid not to read them, there has to be a justifying reason to why she didn't read them". I asked, "WHY didn't you read the chapter". Her response? She said, "It was boring". Then it hit me. Wow... If people refuse to even read a crappy baby-easy chapter to study for a even-a-moron-can-do multiple-choice test, then what will our future be like? Will social structures collapse and will people just sit there wondering what to do? "Hey Joe, it looks like the world's destroyed. Wanna rebuild it?" "No way, too boring".
<br />
<br />This is seriously disturbing me. How is the world going to continue if these people are so lazy, spoiled, and just... so challenged at such easy tasks. Think about it, these people might be tomorow's dentist, lawyer, or taxi driver. Do you want YOUR dentist to sit around doing nothing because YOUR teeth are too boring? Maybe it's time to buy a bomb shelter....
