The dance came. The dance went. It was over and a flash. I don't know what to say. It was great. Wasn't perfect, but it was great. I feel guilty for not revealing more of my thoughts in this post. <br /><br />Now I'm in an engineering building at Purdue. It's absurd how these computers I drive 20 minutes to use fail to open up my 3d files I worked on at home. It's frustrating. Frustrating. Nothing ever gets done in these computer labs because the computers are too slow and the people are too talkative.<br /><br />I should have stayed home and done my homework so I could have gotten sleep before 10pm tonight.<br /><br />Being disappointed from robotics is a recurring theme in my life.
