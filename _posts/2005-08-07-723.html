When you combine a gasoline powered blade and dry grass, you create grass dust. That's what I learned today as I mowed my lawn today. Because of the lack of any rain and additional dried grass clumps from a week ago, the grass dust was quite a problem today. As I tediously cut the grass, meter by meter, I started to become enveloped and coated in a flying cloud of grass dust. It got into my hair, my eyes, my clothes, and my throat. I could feel the grass start to clump onto the fabric while I tried to shield my eyes from the cloud of sheer cellulose terror. Just to let you know, it didn't help. By the end of the half hour of coughing and wheezing, I was expecting hazard pay. It didn't happen. What did happen was that I coughed up little grass and soot particles. It wasn't pretty. The lesson for today is, "Haz-Mat suit required when cutting dry grass."<br /><br />I still feel like a tree.
