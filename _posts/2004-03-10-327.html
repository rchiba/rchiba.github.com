Hey blog-thing.... rough night. I've cried (oh my goodness, YES, but I had a reason) so many tears. I don't like to cry, I really don't. It's all because of my sister and now my eyes are burning like hell. 
<br />I wonder, have any of you actually had a family member go off the edge? No? I didn't think so. Her arms, they haunt my vision. I want to puke, it was horrid. And her eyes, her face, so unlike her. How she spoke, it was vile and disgusting like a slithering, wretched snake. She spoke like someone else. She spies on us for Don, and breaks my heart into pieces. She doesn't believe me, she thinks we hare her, and I may never see her again. If I do, it may for her to kill me or break what I can gather of my broken heart.
<br />To push it away I played pool and worked out. A lot. Already I am feeling my muscles. I hope they hurt tomorrow. It will edge away tonight. 
<br />I feel horrid. I can't stand it. It is like someone has broken my arm and is moving the broken ends back and forth on each other, laughing in my face. Or maybe they have thrown sand in my eyes and are now slowly burning me alive.
<br />Morbid, yes? But it is how I feel. I feel so hurt. 
<br />To tired to continue.
<br />~Amanda
