>After an hour of reading my chemistry textbook, I momentarily forgot what life was like before the rigors of high school drama, standardized testing, and weeks of limited sleep.<br /><br />Alabama. Elementary school. The sky wasn't always blue, but it was blue enough for me. Afternoons were spent doing stunts in my pool or eating snacks while watching cartoons. My next-door-neighbor friend would ring the doorbell. I'd mosey along and open it, and we'd play racing games on the computer for hours. Side by side on the keyboard, we traded off on who got the arrow keys and who got the a, s, d, and w. Windy days yielded much kite flying, and much disappointment as the kites often attached themselves to the nearby pines. I got that kite at a convenience store across the street from the beach.  My dog was a puppy then. She would be walked around the neighborhood and she'd be as crazy as the rest of the dogs. Evenings were cool, always they were the right conditions to admire a very generous and inviting atmosphere. It was different being a kid. Of course it was different.<br /><br />So, back to the real world. I'm feeling nostalgic after digging through the many costumes in a rarely explored closet. Who would have known that closet would have had that old train set that's missing a few pieces, or a scrapbook I made in third grade, or my black ballet slippers? So I passed a quick glance through the inventory to find usable material. I forgot how fun "dress-up" is. With all the sorts of suits and capes and hats, the possibilities are aplenty. I shouldn't be spending a wednesday night doing this though. There are better times for reminiscing.<br /><br />Good night.
