Today was mainly a covert operations day with me using standard procedures to take pictures of my surroundings. 
<br />Which means, I was really bored!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to go to the gym today. I found out that I have really grown. It's extremely weird. One day, I'm as short as a pancake, and now I am as tall as everyone. It happens just like this : *! 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have nothing to write about except that I am accepting blog teamers!
<br />E-mail me at averageyo@mostlysunny.com to get me to accept you onto the blog team. I need good writers who update regularly, and can express their opinions clearly. Please don't be shy! Join Now!
