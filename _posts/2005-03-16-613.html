In today's news... (elipsis?)<br /><br />I got a "Dance Dance Revolution" bundle pack for my $15 PS1! W00t! I'm going to aspire to become a DDR lunatic! Thank you Ryan.<br /><br />Anyways, the pet peeve of today is... People who talk about anything about or related to video games.<br /><br />Video games conjure up bad memories for me. Yes, they are fun for the moment, but when you look around and you realize that you've been playing all night non-stop, that you need to go to the bathroom and puke, that your eyes are burning from the evil screen, that you've lost feeling in your leg, and that in this whole process, didn't accomplish one thing... It's a bit "traumatic", don't you think? Why would anyone sacrifice such valuable time for something as trivial as a "video game"? Well, the answer is simple. People are dumb. I am dumb. Everyone (Except those privilaged "special" children) has played a video game one time or another. The problem is that video games accomplish nothing. You finish a game... but did that affect reality? Did that make you more financially secure. Did finishing Final Fantasy make you more intelligent? No.<br /><br />The sad thing is that some people don't understand it until they are 42, and they're starting to suffer from a wasted life of video games. All of those famed "gamers" are nothing more than rubbish. They accomplish nothing, yet they are idols.<br /><br />Now, moving on to people who talk about video games. People who talk about video games are usually biased, irrational, and unintelligent pricks. <br /><br />Me: "So, what do you think about <insert game here>?"<br /><br />Stupid idiot: "Well, it's like cool. Like, man, it rocks."<br /><br />Me: "Umm... What's that supposed to mean?"<br /><br />Me (Inside Head): "Stupid idiot... Why am I even talking to this moron? I suppose that's the price I have to pay for being one of the only rational people at school. I would be so much happier if I were a dumb idiot too... I disgust myself..."<br /><br />Stupid idiot: "Dude, it's like fun!"<br /><br />Me: "So, how does this game contribute to your life?"<br /><br />Stupid idiot: "It, like, helps my thingie. I mean my eye... eye... huh... hah..."<br /><br />Me: "You mean, 'eye-hand coordination'?"<br /><br />Stupid idiot: "Stop using big words!"<br /><br />------------<br />Obviously, this whole incident occurrs almost everyday. It infuriates me.
