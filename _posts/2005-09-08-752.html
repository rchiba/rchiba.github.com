Bah.<br /><br />I feel like melting into my seat, into a puddle of liquid flesh. <br /><br />I don't feel like complaining about how much homework I have today because whenever I complain about how much homework I have, the whole complaining schpeel always seems to become more pointless. Plus, you probably have lots of homework too, so what's there to complain about?<br /><br />Well, I gave my English paper to Erin to look at. She laughed at it, in a positive way. <br /><br />You don't know how much making someone laugh means to me. I mean, if it's a joke, a cheap chuckle is happy doody, but entertaining someone with written words, well, it's just so fulfilling. It makes my whole life worth living to see someone else take pleasure in reading what I have to say. Erin may not have thought her action to be so deep, but it really is. I've felt good all day because of that tiny, little, inconceivably minute action. It's driven me into a state of euphoria. Well, perhaps not euphoria, but it sure has brightened up my day. I have purpose.<br /><br />So, I suppose the lesson for today is, do a little something and get a lot back. Humanity repeats itself, and to be included in the ring of fulfillment you must do your share. Be nice to someone because it means so much.
