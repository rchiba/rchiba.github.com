Today was yet again a Sunday full of a flurrie of activities. I had to serve tables again. Also, I put a link to the history of amanda, the true story. It's a bit graphic, so be ready. It is not fiction, it is real life.
<br />
<br />Boring was today, I have to go to the gym soon so I have to hurry up. Well, most of the snow is melted and things are looking dreary for tomorow. I have not practiced any for the talent show, and the printer at CVS has been broken for the 5th consecutive time now. I have to go to the gym so Bye...
