The worth of someone at any given moment is impossible to determine, but today I felt very worthless. Or rather, unproductive.<br /><br />I consider the terms interchangeable. After all, the quantification of production of someone is equal to their worth. Unless you attach sentiment to the person, upon which they become valuable no matter how productive they are. Human attachment to things or people that serve no use is both a hindrance and a strength. I am not exempt from this observation. <br /><br />In my room is a small clay pot that I keep on my top desk shelf. On occasion, I take the pot from the shelf, examine it in my hands, and remember things about those times back in the day. The pot itself has no purpose. It can't hold more than a spoonful of water, it isn't suitable for holding food items, and it's not particularly attractive. Even though the ugly purple and white pot has no viable function, I continue to keep it in my room because I'm attached to it. <br /><br />I consider the trinkets in my room to be of significant value to me. I rely on them when I'm in need of emotional support. Thinking of better times is easier when there's a connection between the present and the past. The little things that I am able to capture every day are what makes my life whole. A few pictures here, a post there, my life. <br /><br />So back to talking about why I felt worthless.<br /><br />Walking into the health classroom, I find all of the seats empty as always. The teacher walks in and starts mindlessly shuffling papers. I am reminded why I would never enjoy the work associated with being a teacher. The stacks of papers, folders, and papers in folders dot the desk and surrounding area like little rectangular plateaus rising up above a sea of beige walls and grey carpet. The room absorbs background chatter from the hallways as students rush through the hallways, pulsing through the veins of this mundane establishment. Finally, more students start to filter into the room. By now, I've cleared my desk of everything except my pencil.<br /><br />The bell rings and all of my classmates are in the room, although not in their seats. I was ready two minutes ago. Everyone around me is talking, walking around, making noises, listening to music. I decide to sleep. So I do. For the next twenty minutes, I sleep. When I wake up, the class is mostly settled, and the teacher finally has some sort of control over the volume of the class. The din settles, and the teacher begins to hand out the final. Someone in the back says an obscene word, pressuring peers around him to do the same. Peer pressure works. Soon, there are obscenities traveling through the air from one side to the other in quick succession. The teacher does nothing to stop it. I think she's given up. I wouldn't be surprised if she killed herself right then and there. I would have done so too if I was in that spot. But, the expletives don't annoy me. It's actually a little bit entertaining to hear random swearing in the middle of taking the final. I finish the final in about 20 minutes. I have an hour and a half of extra time. <br /><br />I'm faced with a decision. I can either study for my upcoming Math, English, French, Chemistry, and Speech finals, or sleep. I chose sleep. It was my choice, so feeling worthless is justified, because I am. Hopefully, my lethargy won't carry into the weekend. I would hate to be unprepared.<br /><br />Life continues, and even my little clay pot can't rescue me from my disgraceful self-hate.
