Hello,
<br />You wont believe this. Its pretty funny. This stupid company called Nationals Inc. sent a letter to me. You all know that I am a boy, but this letter was pretty sad. It was a letter to my parents if I wanted to be in a pageant for girls. Obviously, they considered me a girl. Now, since im not a girl, I decided to call their hotline. I said, "Uhhh... Im entered for this pageant things for girls, and umm.. I'm a boy". It was hilarious. I still have the letter. It'll be useful for a laugh someday. Its sad how companies send junkmail these days. Just sad. HAHAHAHAHHAHHAHa...
