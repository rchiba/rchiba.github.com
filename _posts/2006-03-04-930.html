The world says that thinking about feelings is feminine. I don't know the validity of this statement, but I know that I must contradict it. <br /><br />Today, I went to a QuizBowl invitational far away at some military academy (1.5hrs south). The bus ride was routine, but pleasurable. Human contact, intelligent human contact I should say, is so wonderful. Small talk, random music listening, gossip, debate, etc. The whole act is every bit as exciting as it was in the beginning. The beginning of the realization that there is more to my life than myself. So as the droll, but comforting, countryside scrolled across the dusty bus windows, I felt happy. I shouldn't use the word "happy". There was more to the emotion than that. An intangible sense of belonging. Belonging as friends talked about the intricacies of public education society, as people shoved headphones into my ears and played classical music, as the sun slowly rose, warming the freezing metal box with wheels. <br /><br />I'm moving up, Maslow. <br /><br />The bus arrives at the destination. The occupants of the bus direct themselves to the nearest entrance. The doors open to the occupants. The sky is pleasingly blue, the air is crisp, and the kids are awake. Fantastic day for an academic competition.<br /><br />The rounds proceed as you would imagine they would. We win some, lose some, I answer some questions, I don't answer some questions, the world moves on. But, what was so vivaciously stunning about today was the post-competition socialization.<br /><br />The passing of paper notes as the championship round droned on in the front of the room was an exciting activity in which I felt... it can't be described in words. Something so primitive as feelings, but too complicated to be communicated in simple words. Belonging. But something more? A connection. Something.<br /><br />And as I sit here in my silent, cold, and dark room, I feel as if it were all a dream. <br /><br />Was it?
