I'm back from the depths of Washington D.C.<br /><br />As usual, I'm much too tired to describe the trip in detail at the moment. I'm trying to collect my thoughts so I can move on with life, which includes going to summer school tomorrow.<br /><br />The trip was wonderful. Top-notch friends, a united mission, and hours of bus-riding contributed equally to the quality of the trip. Now that I look back at it, life on the road was so much more enjoyable than it is now, in my humid room with no one to talk to but myself. Same old angsty stuff, parents don't understand me, my sister is stupid, friends live far away, etc. I'm looking forward to summer school. Looking forward to having objectives to complete, looking forward to sitting in a classroom with other people.<br /><br />Personally, I look forward better than I look back. I look back and see scattered images, not a string of events. My past always seems like a dream. The future is easier to think of because I can't be wrong about it. One can't be wrong about something that hasn't happened.<br /><br />Well, let's look back to the past. <br /><br />The first day. I remember getting my picture taken in front of the school's stone engraving. I looked particularly suave with my matching red overshirt and black undershirt, or so I tell myself to justify the thirty minutes I took to prepare for the fateful picture. Although, being tricked into running around the school did mar my originally relaxed complexion. The taking of the QuizBowl picture is so significant to me because last year's picture seems to be put up in the hallways everywhere. In that picture, I looked very bad. Everything about it was bad. Posture, hair, clothing, facial expression, lighting conditions, etc. I figured that I might as well put the extra effort in making myself look good in this year's picture. <br /><br />Then the bus ride. A wonderful 9+ hour bus ride to somewhere between Washington D.C. and Lafayette, Indiana. We stay at a hotel. I notice that they upgraded from last year. The walls and carpet seem more ornate, and less smelly. The beds are particularly comfortable. We arrive late at night so I don't have time to do anything besides drag myself to the bed and collapse. I room with friends, the night fades away as we all watch Adult Swim on the television.<br /><br />The next day is an ordinary day of travel. We arrive in the afternoon, play a few matches. We lose one and win one. I don't play because I'm not a starter. I'm grateful.<br /><br />Then everything fades away. Actually, nothing fades away. I'm just fearful that I'm staying up too late to type, and that if I stay up any later I won't be able to function correctly tomorrow.<br /><br />So, games are played, the JV team loses the rest of the games, Varsity makes it to finals, then loses. While the games are being played, my friends and I explore the Smithsonian buildings, have dinner on a rooftop restaurant. In the purple light of the sunset, I watch two snipers patrol the top of the White House. Andrew and I order soup. While the other side of the table is exploding in the noise of chatter, my side remains relatively quiet. Tiffany gets cold and I feel guilty for not doing anything. We both feel bad, wishing the sun would hurry up and rise for the next day.<br /><br />Of course, the sun does rise. Keenan convinces me to go to the pool with him. Then we drag Gero and Tif to the pool as well. We have a grand old time floating on brightly colored foam noodles and splashing each other. I realize that I don't have a towel, so I dry myself off with paper towels from the locker room. I manage to get dry enough to make it to my room.<br /><br />The time comes to go home. The bus ride. Arduous. Forever continuing. But, sitting next to Tif is nice. The bus gets lost near the Pentagon. I manage to make it back to the hotel somewhere between Lafayette, Indiana and Washington D.C. <br /><br />That night, the whole team invades the pool. One of the freshmen convince me to jump in without feeling the water. Upon impact, the frigid liquid stings my skin. Minutes pass, and after a game of "Marco Polo", I end up walking around the pool, shivering and half-delirious. Someone hands me a towel and I warm up a little bit. Being the stupid idiot I am, I jump back in.<br /><br />I learn my lesson and manage to trudge back to the shower. Wonderful. There's a difference between a hot shower and a <b><i>hot</i></b> shower, let me tell you.<br /><br />After the shower, my roommates somehow secure a deck of cards and a game is initiated. Tif and Gero show me how to play. Andrew looks over my shoulder to give me advice. Later, Andrew is in bed with Rachel, just laying and talking, and the rest of us are cross-legged on the floor playing cards. When the card game dies out, we watch low-quality anime. As the room basks in the artificial light from the television, the world seems to be in perfect harmony. <br /><br />I somehow manage to get to sleep. The next day, today, we all get on the busses and go to the local Cracker Barrel establishment. The JV coach, Mike, complains about how he doesn't like the restaurant. A few hours later, he ends up buying a Cracker Barrel shirt. Hours pass, and the countryside rolls by while I sleep. I occasionally wake up to talk. Phones start to ring, and by the time I know it we're all in front of the school, waiting for transportation to arrive. <br /><br />Dazed in the parking lot, pulling baggage from the back of the bus, something feels different. Another QuizBowl season is over, and there's something sad. Time is passing, our lives are being lived. Another chapter in the great book is over. New things must be written. <br /><br />And so here I am, 11:30PM, waiting to fall asleep. And tomorrow is that new chapter. I'll write it myself.
