Today was a day of grief and sorrow, but mostly guilt. <br /><br />Grief and sorrow is pointless, but guilt, well, there's justice in guilt. The knowing that you did something completely wrong, screwed up someone elses life because of your actions. Guilt makes you feel bad, and that's nature's way of doling out punishments, and I'm always at the end of the whip.<br /><br />It all began in Algebra II, when I asked Rus for his calculator. I had time to spare in that class, which was amazing in itself, but stupid ol' me decided to mess with Rus's calculator. I didn't want to hurt it or anything. All I wanted to do was a simple data transfer between his calculator and my calculator. I wanted to see what a program called "EasyData" did, because whenever I ran it, it prompted me to connect another calculator. I connected the cables, turned on the calculators, and tested the program. Apparently, it did nothing. No surprise, software is always over my head, especially in such a non-GUI operating system.<br /><br />Then came my stupid idea to try to link the calculators and play a game. I went to the game menu, started up both games on both calculators, and clicked the fateful enter key. I started to think that time stopped. In reality, the two calculators had just froze. No button pushing, or screaming, or cursing, or shaking would get these two calculators from responding. I responded by pulling out the batteries and rebooting. Rus responded the same way. The only problem was, he had valuable data on his calculator, and I didn't. See, taking the batteries out of the calculator deleted his information. The codes he had scripted for so long, the tedious hours spent laboriously typing out scripts on his calculator, only to have one of his peers destroy everything that was dear and precious to him. He got upset, and inside, I was deeply troubled. Troubled from the fact that my stupid, unnecessary idea caused such turmoil in another one's life. As I type, it's hard to bear such shame, such infamy.<br /><br />My low grades in French that were revealed just a tad bit earlier did not help. I suppose this, and a culmination of other unfortunate events fueled my internal conflict to a point of delirium. I can't bear it! And I haven't truely, formally apologized yet. I feel absolutely terrible, and I feel absolutely terrible writing about how terrible I feel, because I know that I'm just trying to force myself to feel better, when the cold, hard facts say that I am to blame. <br /><br />My today was just a series of unfortunate events, I suppose. But, unlike the overrated, nationally syndicated childrens' novel by the same name, I am at fault.
