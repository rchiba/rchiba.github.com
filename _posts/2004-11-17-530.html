For the past few hours, I have been trying to configure the DVD/CD drive from hell. Obviously, it won't get set up without a fight, so I've practically blown 3 hours out of my life trying to get it configured. It still doesn't work. There is fresh hope though, even though the warranty for the new computer is now void. I'm trying to forget that. Anyways, the computer freezes and I have to figure out why. I'll probably end up taking the CD drive out since the new DVD/CD drive makes it obsolete. Obviously, I need time, and I don't have time. It stinks. I am probably going to come home late tomorow since I'm going to a diving meet with Ryan, and it all comes down to this...

<br />Time used to mean nothing to me. I used to have hours of time I could just blow off. now I don't have any time. People around me still have time, loads of it on their hands. That's why they make video games you know... Anyways, sooner or later, they'll have to learn to wager their time. I'm already learning. It's already time for me to go to sleep, and I'm typing this out in a last ditch effort to get some blogging time in before I collapse from exhaustion. Good night DVD/CD drive from hell...
