<i><b><font face="'Times New Roman',Times,serif" size="6">Special "End of Spring Break" Edition Post</font><br /></b></i><br /><br /><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/2246/p4022920small4ei.jpg" title="A Picture of Me" border="0"><br /><br /><i>Let's celebrate with a <strike>droll</strike> exciting interview with yours truly! Hooray.</i><br /><br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>So, let's start here. Why are you wearing that silly hat nonsense?</b></li></ul><br />Well, for one thing, this is my simply spectacular (My alliteration pwns all) lawn mowing garb. And let me tell you, it's not just for show. Each piece of clothing actually has a purpose for being attached to my body. <br /><br /><b><ul><li>Mowing the lawn, eh? When did you last do that?</li></ul></b><br />I'm wearing this right now, so when do you think I last mowed the lawn, punk? I actually was just mowing the lawn five minutes ago. <br /><br /><b><ul><li>Wait, so you actually wear that?</li></ul></b><br />Yes. I do. I think most of my neighboors have gotten used to it by now, I think, maybe.<br /><br /><b><ul><li>So what kinds of things do you do when you mow the lawn?</li></ul></b><br />Listen to music, move the steering wheel a bit, sometime change speeds, then go back to listening to music. Wash, rinse, repeat. Personally, I think it's a theraputic process. The whole simple pattern of it all. Mowing the lawn is a very brainless task, something that even a droid could do, and this is both a good thing and a bad thing. The bad thing about it is that if one is not careful about one's mental health, then one may become violent. However, the good thing about it is that it is such a mindless task that it enables thought to wander gracefully from idea to idea. The constant loud sound does the exact opposite of what one would expect it to do. For me, the noise cancels out bothersome negative thinkings.<br /><br /><b><ul><li>"Bothersome negative thinkings"? Are you one drugs or something, kid?</li></ul></b><br />Are you?<br /><br /><b><ul><li>Uhh... Moving on. What kinds of things do you think about exactly?</li></ul></b><br />I think about a lot of things. Actually, many of the ideas that spring up on this website come from mowing the lawn. Granted, I only mow the lawn about once a week, so when I said "many", I actually meant a bit less than 1/7th of the ideas. But, the concepts I cover in a 45 minute mow include political, local, social, and personal topics. What I said before was much to broad, so let me narrow things down. I think of ideas for my creative pursuits (webcomics, drawing, 3d, etc.), my tasks at hand (the next <strike>absurd</strike> English project ahead of me), friends (and people whom I wish I were more than such with), and the feasibility of certain socio-economic structures. Of course I never finish such thoughts, so I do so in my room.<br /><br /><b><ul><li>I remember mowing the lawn being much too long for my tastes, so how do you finish so quickly?</li></ul></b><br />Actually, most of the time I start mowing the lawn I don't check the gas. And as such, I usually run out of gas in the middle of mowing the lawn. When this happens, I have to push the darned thing back to the garage (which is a monumental task in itself) and wait for more fuel. I imagine it is quite humorous watching someone like me push a lawn mower for hours to no avail. That's why I think of it as a service to my community to suffer, I'm entertainment! Or, at least that's what I tell myself so I don't jump off...<br /><br /><b><ul><li>Jump off what?</li></ul></b><br /><i>*nervous laugh*</i> umm... the lawn mower of course! We're talking about mowing the lawn aren't we?<br /><br /><b><ul><li>This is where I stop the tape and walk away.</li></ul></b><br />No! Wait, I still haven't told you why I wear these absurd hats!<br /><br /><b><ul><li>*runs away*</li></ul></b><br /><br /><br />
