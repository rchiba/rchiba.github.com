My head is all crooked and fuzzy.<br/><br/>And I don't know what to do anymore, and I don't know what to do anymore.<br/><br/>My nose is running and the world is spinning.<br/><br/>And I don't know what to do anymore, and I don't know what to do anymore.<br/><br/>And I ask myself, "How am I going to get myself out of this illness?"<br/><br/>The answer is to wait. Wait for it to die on its own, to live out its lifespan, to wait and hope that there will be a day in the future when I'm not sick, when I do feel enthusiastic about waking up in the morning. Hoping, with a simple kind of hope that is like an old pair of shoes. The same hope that I've been using for years and years. The hope that resides in my mind. It pushes, it moves mountains. An ethereal being that lives on through repeated beatings. Repeated failures. Repeated circumstances, and repeated self-hate. It is a gem that refuses to be cut, to conform to my feelings. This hope resides safely, protected by itself, by its very nature to be present in all mankind. Hope.<br/><br/>And waiting. Lots of waiting for the cold to die away and leave me be. To let me live the rest of my life without a headache. Let the pressures in my head come from other things, not a trivial physical malady. To push on with the hope, and to wait patiently with the power to overcome stronger than the urge to give up.<br/><br/>Moving forward. Sick. Physics tests. Glass doors. Blue plastic lunch tray. Got to get through. Got to get through. Chemistry book. A wrong answer. Embarrassment. Got to persist. Must move forward. Test. Minutes pass. Questions unanswered. Failure. Must get through. Push, push, push. No looking back, there is no past that can be rewritten. Move now, comply to the standards of time and existence. <br/><br/>I got home. And that's all I needed to do for today. One foot in front of the other.Â
