Devin asked me a question that has come up recently. Why do I hate Xanga? Well, I hate Xanga because... It's a bit like comparing apples and oranges. I find the whole Xanga thing totally absurd because the whole thing is just an extentended and elongated version of IM'ing. The Xanga templates make me want to puke, and about 95% of all people using Xanga are usually literally and socially challenged individuals who are neither articulate nor accurate. With Xanga names like, "IRISHPRANCER81" and "Cold_As_Ice2k" who is going to take anything you say seriously? First of all, all caps just demonstrates that you're an insensitive moron. Numbers also signal that you are not creative to come up with an original name. Blech... <br /><br />Devin commented that the advantage of Xangas is that your supposed "friends" can comment on them. I find this absolutely horrid. Xangas seem to me like an easy way to lose friends and start a social battle with completely illogical and inarticulate brutes who prefer to write without proper punctuation and style. I don't want people to comment on what I say. If I didn't care, why wouldn't I just ramble on about this nonsense at school? What would be point of this whole blogging escapade!? This kind of media enables me to communicate with control and finesse. Xangas seem dirty, unengaging, absurd, wrong, and too social for me. I would rather sit here and talk to myself and a few other close friends than jump into a violent, turbulent social scene full of higher-ups and uneducated peons. Xangas don't appeal to me. Don't talk about Xangas near me. Don't let me hear the word Xanga. Disgust fills my soul.<br /><br />Time to study for finals!
