There is grit in my hair from riding in the back of a truck. I was riding in the back of the truck on the way home from the robotics competition. As I sat in the truck and as the green blades of grass zipped past me, the sand sitting on the floor of the truck was pulled up to the sky, the dynamics of air and sand being demonstrated by nature. The sand flies up, pelts my face, and the wind dies down. The graveyards, old motel billboards, and shiny new minivans with anxious little children in them, all zip around me like a blur. A giant blur. The truck ride is a painfully fun tradition. I will be doing it again early tomorrow morning. <br /><br />The giant blur of my life.<br /><br />It sort of makes you think of one's perception of speed, and the speed of time. It doesn't make sense to say "speed of time", but everyone knows the feeling. The feeling that something passed by too quickly, or a period of time feels much too slow for comfort. This afternoon felt slow. I'm not a very integral part of the robotics team, so I was there for the sake of being there. Something good did come out of the competition though. I got to meet a very good character animator from another team. He's older than me, so I don't have to feel too envious (although, he is much more knowledgeable in the subject that I am, and so I do feel envious at times). I should feel lucky, from him I'm sure I can learn plenty.<br /><br />But, other than that, the day was pretty sleepy. I have to work the morning shift tomorrow, so I need rest. Something that has changed thanks to the magic or robotics.
