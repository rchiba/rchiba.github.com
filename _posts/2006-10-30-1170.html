I'm back.<br /><br />Coming back from a frigid Canadian city, I have realized how warm Indiana is. My stay in Montreal was cold, wet, and very French.<br /><br />I'm tired. You know the feeling. The "I just got home from a hours long drive and cramped airplane seat travel, and now I've got to study for chemistry, hoorah (with snappy sarcasm)" tiredness.
