I'm not facing the computer. Maybe if I don't face the computer, I'll think better. Looking at the small 800x600 screen is so very restricting. It's so restricting in fact, that sometimes I have great difficulty in finding topics to expand upon, words to throw out into the fray. I turn around to look at the computer screen for typographic errors. None so far, but I shouldn't look back. All I have to do is trust myself.  Trust myself to do the right thing, and to type the right words. I really enjoy the lighting of my room. I've come to appreciate darkness, as well as light. I have one fluorescent lamp that casts a grayish light throughout my room. The glaring brightness of my studio light is too gaudy for the current mood. I guess it's only appealing during the winter, when I need the light to make up for the sunlight that never seems to reach me through the dreary winter clouds.<br /><br />I got paid today. It's quite a feeling to finally be reimbursed for the hours I spent risking my skin to the sun, and the rest of my body to the muriatic acid I put in the pool. The payment came in the form of a little beige check. I suppose I'll cash it tomorrow, to exchange it for cash money. But, when the bank worker hands me the money from the register, what is it worth it to her? Hundreds of thousands of bills pass through her hands, and how does my measly hundred or two affect her? They're just green rags with numbers on them. A modern quantification of the time and energy spent working.<br /><br />And these slips of paper do nothing but sit in front of me, taunting me. They urge me to spend them, but I know I cannot. My post-purchase guilt is hard to bear. And the money does not bring me happiness, or even self-satisfaction. When I make a 10-second club animation, it brings me satisfaction. When I draw another picture, it brings me satisfaction. When I type an entry, it brings be satisfaction. Green rags don't bring me satisfaction. They are so important though. But, why? I hope to someday live a simpler life and make a lesser role of these decrepit slips.<br /><br />I plan to wake up an hour earlier tomorrow. My hypothesis is that if I wake up earlier, I'll be less groggy during summer school. I hope to prove myself right in a little more than seven hours.
