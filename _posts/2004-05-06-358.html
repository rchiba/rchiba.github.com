I've been working on my Kow Studios website. That's why I've been so busy.
<br />Also, the fact that I was practicing insanely for the band playing test. We have to memorize 12 scales each consisting of 15 notes and  playing them in order.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />For this band test, many are getting bad grades. I think you can only blame them, because some didn't even try, or even practice at all. I think Lora Corterbien is the only person I can relate to in band because I think we are one of the very few who actually do their homework early and manage time. I am ridiculed from time to time about how I do my homework when I get home, or how I do it exceedingly more efficiently than many of my classmates. I really don't like it how people ridicule me. Anyways, alot of people got bad scores, but the percussion are going to get good scores.

<br />In other news, I've found my Super Smash Brothers Nintendo Orchestral CD in a drawer near the computer. I immediately burned it onto the hard drive on the computer and I am listening to it right now. I am also downloading a ton of techno to use in the various Kow Studios productions. I hope Devin can show up for our Saturday screening because if we don't, I don't think this opperation will succeed. Thus Devin is crucial to the project. Anyways, my mom wants to get a new digital camera because the one I have is not that great (2 Mega Pixel).
