Hullo, blog-thing. It's me again. They're drunk as usual. If you don't know by now, they're my parents. I don't care. I hope they leave me alone this time. I can't wait to get the lock on my door. I can't wait to move out. Angela's mad at me. I'm sad. I'm happy. I'm confused. I wish life were easier sometimes. Of course, now I contradict what I told my mom earlier, but I don't mind. But does that make me a hypocrite? If it does, I'm sorry. And if it doesn't? I'm sorry too. I guess saying sorry is a hard habit to break. Sorry, sorry, sorry. My life is full of sorries and broken things. Look at all the little pieces dear blog, look at them all. Sometimes I feel so broken. No one is helping me aside from sunny. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. Sorry, probably my fault. Something has to me. My fault so many years ago for being so innocent and naive. Stupid me who was afraid of storms. And stupid me who thought she could trust. Stupid, stupid, stupid. People have been telling me it's not my fault, that he's a sick man. But I feel horrible. Dirty. I want it to go away. But it doesn't, does it? It never does, it never will. I will have to remember someone else on me. I will have to always see that night so vividly in my mind, I will always, ALWAYS remember it. 
<br />And I don't suppose it is fair. 
<br />My life? A war. A waging world war three and four. Three with the divorce when my sister and I were the weapons of mass destruction, and now world war four, my sister and I pivoted against each other by a cruel hand of fate. How monotonous, how droll, how unfair and cruel. So much of this war. Is that all I will ever know?
<br />I suppose many must think me sweet and innocent, incapable of committing such heinous crimes against others. But I'll tell you I was a greedy little child, blog-thing. I wanted things like all children do. I will never forget my lies, and the heavy prices my sister and I paid for them. The rivers of tears, the screams, the fits. 
<br />Am I going insane dear-blog? Am I going off? I hope not. I think not. So why does everyone stare at me so gosh darn sad?! What s it that concerns them? My eating habits? My scars? My ever ad and despondent eyes so empty of youth and shine?! Or could it be the fact that my childhood was robbed from me? I will ask sunny. She can tell me. She can help me when no one else can.
<br />Oh this horrid thoughts in me. I have half the mind not to publish this. But who cares?! I'm already made fun of! I already can't go outside without Evans laughed at? So why do I care? Oh people who know me or don't know me and read this. I ask not for your pity, so don't give it. All you have read is a plea for help from a  child to one's parents, who are too far into their own problems to help. 
<br />Yes, don't give me any pity for I will only throw it back at you and smile, smile, smile. I will keep on going,a and I will not crack. 
<br />For when no one will help me, do you know what I've got? I've got a drop of sunshine in my pocket. A honey colored stone that reminds me of the sunlight that so warms me. 
<br />~Amanda.
<br />P.S. I failed my math test by the way.
