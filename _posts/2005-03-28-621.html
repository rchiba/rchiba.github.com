I'm a bit addicted to a game called "psychobabble" on popcap.com. I know, it's sad that I'm once again being manipulated by corporate giants, but it has to be done, for the sake of the capitalistic economy, or not. <br /><br />Anyways, painting, painting, and more painting will commence tomorrow. Also, darn. I lost my train of thought. Train... Train... choo choo train! w00t. Ok, sleep is needed, if you can't tell. Uh... can't remember, but I'm going to put shinny stuff in the paint tomorrow. Did you know that my feet are turning purple? I think it's my eyes...<br /><br />Oh yes, now I remember. I'm sporting a nifty "wolverine" hairstyle. It's a hairstyle where my gigantisimo sideburns stick out of my head at a 90 degree angle while my bangs are formed into two pointly little prongs that stick out of my head. I think it enables the hair to dry faster. Nedd sleep. I'm gettinga drwosyh. SSSSGodnihgt.
