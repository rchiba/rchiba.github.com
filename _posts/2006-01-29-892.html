Note: Weekend project (Public Transportation) for this weekend has been completed. Check the "my Art" link to see it.<br /><br />On a positive note, I'm updating for the first time in a long time before 9PM. This is a big step for me, to get my biological clock closer to normal. <br /><br />The new hard drive I installed a bit ago is working flawlessly. Right now, I'm voraciously putting multimedia content on it as I type.<br /><br />Other than that, today was mostly a work-day. Working on random Robotics things, working on homework, working on my weekend project, working on resetting my biological clock, working on my schedule for next year, work, work, work.<br /><br />And to think, not "real" work. Not one of my friends is going to do summer school classes. Many are not because they are going to get jobs. I kind of feel left out, but I guess that my first job is school. I'm sure some place would hire me, but I guess I'm too good for them. That and me not being a citizen and all. Yeah, that thing.<br /><br />I'm going to draw something now.
