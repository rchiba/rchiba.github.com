It is afternoon right now and my dad will be back soon. That means that I have to go to the gym. It is a weird feeling when I go to the gym. I feel that I dread the gym and I also feel that I really want to go too. This is a very stressful feeling and I am feeling it right now. I just ate lunch and I ate nemo. Well, in my sushi, I ate fish eggs. Like Nemo. Fish eggs arent bad. Their taste isnt strong and is very mild. It is great with avacado. It may seem gross to you but it really doesnt taste bad when you dont think about it. Well, thats it for now... I guess. ;)
