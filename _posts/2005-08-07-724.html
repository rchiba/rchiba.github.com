After <a href="http://www.vgcats.com/jack.php/">this</a> incident, I decided to send Jacko (a.k.a. Jack Thompson) an email. His email is at "jackpeace@comcast.net"<br /><br />This is the email I sent to Mr. LawyerPig (a.k.a. Jack Thompson)<br />------------<br />From: billforcet@gmail.com<br />To: jackpeace@comcast.net  <br />Reply | Reply to all | Forward | Print | Trash this message | Show original <br />Stop bullying Scott. He's my role model. I feel offended when greedy,<br />capitalistic pigs like you take such a stance on mere games for the<br />sake of your own fiscal gain. You truely define the word "greedy,<br />lawyer pig." Every night, the world laughs and mocks you, yet you<br />continue on your false crusade. Don't bother Scott, because we have<br />every right to bother you, you sick pig.<br /><br />-Bill Forcet<br />------------<br /><br />And the amazing thing is that he replied to little old me.<br /><br />This is his reply email.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />From: Jack Thompson <jackpeace@comcast.net><br />To: Bill Forcet <billforcet@gmail.com>  <br />Reply | Reply to all | Forward | Print | Trash this message | Show original <br />I'm not bullying him.  I pointed out that Killer 7 is not about hidden or<br />embedded violence.  I was a critic of GTA for the patent violence for years.<br />Scott wasn't paying attention.  he needs to stop sending me emails.  it's<br />harassment. same with you, bucko<br />-----------<br /><br />Obviously this nonsense lawyer pig thinks he can get away with harassing <em>the</em> Scott Ramsoomair. Not the case. He also thinks he can get away with bad grammar. Well, that's not the case either, since he is sure sounding like he has autism or some other mental disease. Well, you heard me. I bothered him, so why don't you? Maybe he'll threaten you with his lawyer pig fat. Stupid pig.
