What does it mean when two people from different parts of your social network say the same thing at the same time?

Hypotheses:
<ul>
	<li>People are more similar than different.</li>
	<li>There is a limited vocabulary in English for expressing post-birthday gratitude.</li>
	<li>Facebook is just noise.</li>
</ul>
