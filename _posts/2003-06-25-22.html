Hello, Its me again
<br />It is bright new day with no clouds again. I wish it would rain at least 1 day or 2 this month. I like variety. I am very tired because I stayed up last night. Or maybe its because I worked out last night. I dunno. It's very weird sitting down in a hard chair and looking at some pretty colors in a box in front of me pushing buttons. It is very weird indeed. Anyways, my friend is coming over today and I am happy. The only social contact I have made to any one this week has been through the internet. The desk I'm typing at is very cluttered and I am very angry at all the things that clutter it. It is not a normal anger, it just feels different. I want to see all of that stuff out of there and cleared off of my desk. I want to see clear open space where I can see the desk, not a un seeable desk under a calculator, digital camera, junk mail, CD's, and various pens and other writing utensils. Well thats my opinion on my desk and I hope u enjoyed it. Well thats it for now...
