I just found out why my life is so boring in Indiana and why I seclude myself from things.  The reason is because I want to go back to my old house in Minnesota, back to my old friends.  I had a real life there, but here, I do nothing to get to know my environment and surroundings.  I've tied to forget about my grief but it will never leave my mind, not until I make my grief happy by going back but that will undoubtedly never happen.  I knew where everything was where I used to live but here in Indiana, I only know how to get to two places, school and Meijer.  I cannot wait to grow up so I can forefill my grief with happiness by going back to see my friends again.  I don't even know if my friends back there remember me anymore.  I probably never find too.  I am glad i have found out why I seclude myself from things and other peoples and I am aalso glad I have found out how to fix my grief.
