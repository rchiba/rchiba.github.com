I love it when there's so many things to do.<br /><br />Everything swirls around and comes together in the end as a coherent framework. A list of tasks becomes a mesh of activity, a long sequence of work and play. And it doesn't matter what it pertains to. Robotics, school, personal income. It's all good, it's all productive. Keeping me from vegetating in front of digg.com or CNN Headline News. It's a good thing to be active. Keeps my mind distracted and happy. <br /><br />Today was my last day of working at the pool. The last day was a cheery one. A cloudy sky resulted in an empty pool. I like it when nobody comes to the pool, I feel free to act like myself, instead of some mindless pool-droid intent on collecting guest fees and keeping kids under 14 out of the spa. And when it's cloudy, the air is cool. Perfect weather to sit in the hot tub and wantonly flick water into the air. It's the best when it rains.<br /><br />But, here I am. Pool job is over. Another sign that the seasons are changing. I like fall though. I like the lowering of the temperature. It makes my life much more comfortable. In the fall, my room is no longer an oven.
