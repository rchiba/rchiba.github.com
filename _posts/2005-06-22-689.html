Bad things come out of war, but war inadvertently leads to mass technological advancements for the winning country. If I was to name one major technological advancement of the 20th century that developed from a war, that technology would be duct tape.<br /><br />Duct tape, or duck tape (marketed by Duck Products), was created during WWII, specifically 1942. It was originally designed to hold shell casings together. It was produced by Permacel (A subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson)and was built to repel water. The soldiers called it "duck tape" since the originally cotton backing or the tape repelled water like the back of a duck. They used it to patch just about anything.<br /><br />After the war, the housing market and population boomed which led many uses for the new tape. To speed up the production of housing, builders often used the tape to seal ducts, which led to the name "duct tape." Professionals are now restricted from using duct tape since building codes have deemed them ineffective.<br /><br />NASA was in a dire situation when the carbon dioxide filters failed on a Apollo 13 mission in 1970. If they couldn't fix these filters, all three astronauts would be soon dead. Ironically, NASA resorted to duct tape to fix the filters. Duct tape has saved astronauts. Three to be exact.<br /><br />Now, don't you want to see a pretty picture of duck/duct tape in good use? Here you go.<br /><br /><img SRC="http://www.galleryone.com/images/bullas/bullas%20-%20duck%20tape.jpg">
