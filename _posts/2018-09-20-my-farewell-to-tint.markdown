If you're connected to me or anyone else at TINT, you might know that we've been looking for someone to take the keys to our company for quite some time. Our search over the past year has been fraught with so many ups and downs that it deserves its own series of posts, but the big news is that we signed a deal to sell TINT to [Filestack](https://www.filestack.com/). The press release will cover what both organizations want the world to know: This deal is a winning union between two successful companies, combining forces to strategically take on more of the user generated content market.

I wholeheartedly believe this is true. But, this post isn't about that. It's about what the deal means for me, in a way that could never be represented in a merger agreement or capitalization table.

## Company Timeline

To catch you up on what we've been up to for the past 7 years:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3aXQd_desG8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**2011**: Hypemarks starts as Tim's [business school class project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H11xFW_NeS-fXoY9HVcVr73RJOAQF53N7aORd6F8Mj8/edit?usp=sharing). In his homework, he describes the concept: _"HypeMarks.com is a social bookmarking site that allows consumers to search the trending sites of today based on a specific category, store (bookmark) their favorite ones, and share the new-found sites with their friends."_

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dNEPaWFhAzw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**2012**: Through a lot of hustle and luck, Tim builds the initial team, and Hypemarks goes from a university basement student project to a seed funded startup.

![Tent](https://draftin.com:443/images/61188?token=jzbmySOysI0nesZAWP2u1gHKsbhQwbKZldCK893oXzOWYUeGqKceqd3ClOcBxUXnPhhaidmw2ZmilXJGISF7W30) 

**2013**: Founders move to SF, pivot from Hypemarks to TINT, almost run out of money, and at the last minute achieve ramen profitability. Tim and I shared a studio together, and I slept on an air mattress in a tent.

![Rohith's First Day](https://draftin.com:443/images/62403?token=9Ds8RNHxU37lzt2fZBXxkGJDXfqoJ6BsyjZa8FxHR8puE6yGZfTxodD-uEBlhlH5JaIkfpBsRI00NqqovHB5VHc) 

**2014**: Ramen profitability turns to sustainable business growth and we hire the first employees. Pictured above are Zen and Ro on Ro's first day.

![New Office](http://staging.tintup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ryochiba.hackpad.com_W9y0E5gwF4h_p.419835_1463964569744_2501bryant.jpg)

**2015**: Growth continues quickly, with impressive customers signing on, and TINT expands rapidly. 19 to 37 full-time employees. Moving from a 3,000 to 10,000 sqft office. Expanding sales globally with reps in UK, Dubai, and Brazil.

![TINT revenue vs expenses](https://draftin.com:443/images/62407?token=RVvllCxnMn__Tc5PGfy8DchdikXcSzHZzK9i2JgDiddMkPUxAstjnG0Yi5GKDQh4KUeg3vPcZ3LYQ_VukNwWnwQ) 

**2016**: Revenue growth plateaus while expenses climb due to rapid growth, so we have our [first layoffs](http://ryochiba.com/2016/06/08/tough-times-dont-last-but-tough-startups-do.html) to stabilize the business, and work to reduce churn and increase contract value.

![16110496_1258214344258005_2669742978179792896_n.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/62432?token=CcNpqBWjKK90yExLjWFW9ZjNfTVJmLFJH9xxKnnpkgtLKiO3s5c3pC35OcBdwHixddhAuWuvtdLzXHQ2MvF11L8) 

**2017**: Revenue still hasn't grown so we continue pushing hard as a team, offering an unlimited plan for enterprises, and later in the year we hire experienced senior directors of sales and marketing.

![Packing up](https://draftin.com:443/images/62431?token=xpV50NEIkOR33DIVopt1ef8un0jDL7O6ao_CkIfnyiWS0MVuM-YbGCrmNVnWXQ18_lEF4b3j1G5byfAmIhi72sM) 

**2018**: The investments we made in 2017 did not result in growth, so we make big cuts in sales and marketing and focus on profitability instead of growth. We move out of our office in the Mission and into a coworking space. Tim works full time on an exit.

## Looking Back

Looking back on the timeline, it's actually shocking to me how long I was able to last on the emotional rollercoaster. The innocence of the early years, the exuberance of early growth, the shock of hitting the plateau, the determination in the face of continuous challenge, and the grind of a slow retraction.

My worldview has changed thanks to all of the madness that comes with operating a small business. Tim has handled more of it than anyone else, but me, Nik, and others on the team have faced it at one point or another. There's a lot of crazy stuff behind the scenes that no-one talks about. Patent trolls. Ex-employee going rogue and stealing customers. Surprise illegal office zoning. Surprise Instagram API changes that break the product. Getting customers (temporarily) blacklisted by Google for mining bitcoin. Layoffs. Lost friends. Burnout.

And TINT was able to find a way to handle each of those situations. As time has passed, the sharp pain of these situations has mellowed into experience. And the experience is what I joined this team, so ultimately I am grateful for the opportunity.

There are also many good memories that I hope to keep forever. Hackathons where we built some really cool stuff. Getting lunch with the engineering team in the south park every day. Retreats in grand mountain houses. Rallying together in times of company crisis. Meeting customers who love our product. Meeting random people who have used our product. Seeing the product randomly out there in the world.

And the relationships. To think that TINT helped create friendships and professional connections that people will take with them into the future, that is rewarding to think about. 

So yeah, it's been a wild ride. And there's a lot to be grateful for, even the bad stuff.

The ride has exceeded my expectations. Because I had no idea that this is how TINT would turn out when I met Tim, and there have been so many serendipitous twists and turns along the way. And to describe how much this TINT experience has exceeded my expectations, I will now indulge myself in writing a brief description of my life as it relates to this company:

## Humble Beginnings

![First Computer](https://draftin.com:443/images/62404?token=omgAdTjDSFkAy26shB3E8BjEDl5kQ_G5ov7LOfvSkX5-9vN1cZjNjVSZmHWzi7t4A320jBFaTIGdZOJXFYdOWng) 

Sometime in the mid 90's our family got our first computer (the photo above is the model our family got, a Power Mac 7100). I remember learning about the Internet, loading a webpage for the first time, and being **amazed** that anyone in the world would see the same page if they typed the same thing into the address bar. And not only that, but anyone could create pages for whatever they wanted, even me! But unfortunately after asking my parents to help me set up a web page, they said that it costs money and even if they were to pay money to let their 8-year old dabble in web things, they wouldn't know how to do it.

![Screenshot of Angelfire page](https://draftin.com:443/images/62433?token=SPEM3O4fbK_ZmdQF6KI-Wod61twRdmmwYMHZqSRgwBXzw8DKyibsK4MrcruDgEqZVPTcIzqXeP7lZrGPiHOf9m4) 

So, I aged through my regular milestones, and later on I learned basic HTML/CSS by customizing my Neopets shopfront, setting up an Angelfire page of strange pre-adolescent musings, and modifying my Blogger template. My dream job in middle school was working for Flickr as "PHP Engineer", but it was seemingly totally unattainable. I saw some PHP when I clicked on the wrong button on Wordpress and it was intimidating and gibberish-like.

![Screenshot of Robotics Homepage](https://draftin.com:443/images/62405?token=BRNXdoovsKwVwCSPfqkuxJZ3gZQy0k7EyGYnGBmtp6hG5aMybIjv30WXhD72-0W_CY-UoB2gG0nN2ZpKZ-3-bt8) 

In high school I was part of the robotics team, but I didn't do any robot programming. I was embarrassed to try when there were already other kids who knew how to do "real programming" so I worked on the Public Relations team where we focused on putting together marketing material to promote robotics. Brochures, essays, an animation, and a website (screenshot above).

When it came time to choose a major for college, I took my dad's advice: "If you aren't talented at anything, you should be a doctor because you get paid a lot and all you have to do is memorize things." So, I entered college as a Pre-med student in biomedical engineering. I tacked on a minor in Computer Science because I still had hope of working at Flickr. Who knows? I kept my expectations low. Especially with so many other kids with AP-CS classes.

Junior year, I started to have second thoughts about going into medicine. My doubts stemmed mainly from how stark the difference was between the attitude of students in CS vs Pre-med. I remembered my first Pre-med "study session", and being surprised that it ended up being a "copy session" where most of the students were looking for another student's homework to copy. Afterward, I had the crappy feeling of being used. Another negative experience that comes to mind is how effed up I felt about the Pre-med honors society really just being a o-chem test-bank society.

The experience on the CS side was different. We worked on team projects where people genuinely worked together. So I figured, if these are the kind of people I'm going to work with for the rest of my life, I'll take the chill ones. I dropped Pre-med and switched majors to focus on CS full-time.

After switching majors, that's when I started reading Hacker News more and learning more about the startup scene.

## The Start of Something

When I met Tim, it was through my ex-girlfriend Pauline, who went up to him to ask about planting more trees on campus. Tim was in Student Government, part of the Environmental Committee. Tim couldn't do anything to help, but asked her if she knew anyone in the engineering school who could help him with his idea. She did, and that's how my relationship with Tim began.

![Screenshot of email with Tim](https://draftin.com:443/images/61154?token=PrfC2bSTFKBaXY1FB1Gcn-mWQlco5mnLlMfW7Oi7j1ujn-h7ohd89JBblLdN3ZOnZxVLej0OEF51tJBzmp-tcmo) 

We worked out of a student apartment, meeting after class and staying late into the night. This is embarrassing to admit but imagine the most wantrapreneur college students hunched over our laptops listening to The Social Network soundtrack on repeat. That was us. Listening to that soundtrack still brings me back to those uncertain days.

That summer, I managed to get an internship at real tech company, Yahoo! Out of the [30 companies I applied to](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eoeuBg-9F_jn2kT2zGWdA-zSdXxX2yjQY_3DrG8cS14/edit?usp=sharing&authkey=CIf-tPQH), I got accepted to 2. And was the 7th pick at the one I joined. I learned enough web development at that internship to be able to come back senior year and actually contribute to Tim's Hypemarks project.

All of this life-history summary is to say that I never expected to be able to have the skills and knowledge to go off and help create a product and organization as substantial as TINT. Even though 2016-2018 were hard years where we weren't able to grow the business, I am still incredibly lucky to have chanced into the opportunity to achieve my wildest dreams.

I am really lucky.

## Gratitude

There is just too much gratitude to express.

![IMG_1532 (1).JPG](https://draftin.com:443/images/62435?token=DSVtYl2rIVhaAwYSdV-_HBHJfaoRdBoUYjg63XnTKFdp92HwCvnLRRX4QlhIVOqjNJojLtMgO6QMvDE2hlDQ5xM) 

**Tim** - I hope you are able to take the break you need after TINT because you deserve it. People say shit rolls downhill but I've found that it rolls equally uphill. When all the easy decisions have been made by others, the hardest ones are the ones you had to face. You have unfailingly looked out for the best interest of the team and company and that's the most anyone can ask for in a leader. "It's not about the idea, it's about the team." That's what you said to me when I was on the fence about joining you after graduating. I'm lucky to have trusted you.

**Nik** - It's hard to believe that we met in a library basement in college, and have been working together almost daily up until today. What a pleasure it has been to work with such an ambitious and hard working person like you. Someday I will search google for "sean parker of india" and see your name as the first result. Thank you for having my back, and also being outrageously photogenic and letting me take countless pictures of you throughout our TINT journey.

**The TINT Team** - I've been lucky enough to work with more than 60 teammates while at this company. Each brought their unique skills to the table to help us advance the company to this exit. I'm going to miss being surrounded and inspired by such a talented team. I've absorbed so much in the experience of working together, and I have also set wildly higher bars for performance in every degree, whether that's programming, design, sales, or support. Can they code as well as Dan? Sell as well as Kelly? Or organize as well as Jess? These are questions I'll be asking myself in my future roles. The journey has been tumultuous, but I hope that y'all were able to grow from the experience too. For the continuing team, the gratitude extends into the future. The brand that we've worked so hard to create now rests with you.

**Our Customers** - Where would this venture be without our customers? I have my personal favorites. Greg from Mambo Media, thank you for being willing to Gchat late at night and give us product feedback in our early days. Nasdaq for putting TINT on the Times Square jumbotron on our team trip to New York. The Sakura of America team for the free boxes of Pigma Microns that powered all of my analog writing at TINT. Kayla at Blue Apron for always being down for a product feedback call. Purdue University, I never thought the university I grew up next to would end up being a customer! And Bob Harrington and the Orange Department at Specialty Produce for being our biggest customer champions.

**Monica** - Thanks for being the behind the scenes "Director of HR" when it came to the plethora of people challenges I faced at TINT. You always have a thoughtful perspective that reflects your ability to consider everyone's needs and wants. I am very lucky to have met such a smart peach.

![Pic of Team TINT in front of Idealab](https://draftin.com:443/images/61195?token=2VXKJJV4awtuuYTo_ZVcuSQODbF1-8mLN9X7j2RTcSUq40EFYRNioVOzpzUxtnzjLVu2HLFdtMPzbvlIquS3pH8) 

**Idealab/StartEngine** - Thank you for believing in us from the very beginning. We really didn't know what we were doing back then, but you helped us get off the ground and we wouldn't be here without you.

![Picture of Zen](https://draftin.com:443/images/61192?token=uEQAX2fTmQGwplg51_8hPBeAaPV-bg5RuVNd0XLgmpv9Olh0JyZI2E8fEhi-uT6wgsJf1kq-3QP56NeRtw6CjwU) 

**Zen** - You deserve a special shoutout for being our very first employee and for the inspiration you brought to our team. I still follow your mantra of "motion inspires emotion", and attribute our initial success to your insistence that we switch all of our passwords to "100kMRR". I don't know why we stopped doing that.

![Gokce and Prannay at Yahoo](https://draftin.com:443/images/61191?token=FSnwgr2fST1vGJfo2i2qGSvxqdljKx8wC1yNLiVuNvCTXD_NQl26Ceuat4MkDM5TcKRQFzYPkV8jdYMW1pUNOwI) 

**Gokce and Prannay** - Thanks for being my mentors during my Yahoo! internship, and teaching me that "There is no company, only a team". The technical skills I learned from you guys were what gave me the confidence to start my own thing. I even got to work on an improvement to Flickr at a hackathon! That was a great summer.

![Screenshot of Daily Brink](https://draftin.com:443/images/61193?token=RsWTBm2Lqs7vWtRzy_wVyVRwWIwtXBW4tZe0VRjLJpYHk3E7P1abVGmfeLZTnVoR8xjO1PKa4EMRKFX2WfPOv7s) 

**Gary, Jeremy, Dani** - Thanks for bringing me on as a "webmaster" for my first technical project of any merit. Daily Brink was the project that got the attention of my eventual manager at Yahoo!. Looking back, it's pretty impressive how much content we put together. 

# What's Next?

There are a couple of mantras I've followed through the TINT journey that I plan on applying after the 90 day transition period:

* **"Keep doors open"** - I believe that my optimal path to achieving success is to create opportunities and see what happens rather than picking an end goal and rushing to it.
* **"Everything happens for no reason"** - The funny thing is that Tim has an arm tattoo that has the exact opposite of this mantra. I don't bring this up in front of him because I don't want to invalidate his world view, but I find it awesome that regardless we've always worked well together. Back to the mantra, I think that serendipity plays a far larger factor in life than is commonly acknowledged.
* **"Do your best"** - I've always felt that doing your best is the easiest way to avoid regret. The concept is interesting to me because it doesn't necessitate that you do "the best", just "your best", and begs the question "what is my best?" which leads to the definition of personal best, which is how growth is catalyzed. I'll be doing my best to take the energy that was being focused on the company, and focus on myself and finding what's next.

I am working full-time on transitioning the company until the middle of November, but after that, I would love to find another team of people trying to build a SaaS company from scratch and give it another go, so I'll be looking around for people who would be interested. If you know anyone who's looking to collaborate on a project that would benefit from a growth hacker / front-end developer, let me know!

With \#tintlove,

- Ryo
