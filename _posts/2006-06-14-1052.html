I was standing in my shower when I felt like I wasn't really there. The water, the sensation of water hitting my skin, something didn't seem right. The water was warm, but there was something inside that kept me from feeling the heat. It wasn't that I was unaware of the world around me, but I somehow felt detached. Is this really me? Where have I come from and where will I go? I came from being a stupid immature kid, to a very confused teenager. Cliche, but it isn't a lie. But, sometimes I think about how there are so many people in the world, and how I'm here with them all. But, all of us know the important people, the people who have done great deeds or misdeeds, proven their worth whether through charisma or strength. <br /><br />What were they thinking when they were staring at their shower wall? Who did they think they were, and did they intend to be so great from the beginning? I mean, what would it feel like to be Hitler, just after failing sixth grade? He must have stared at his shower wall and thought to himself just as we all do. But, what did he think of himself? <br /><br />There are people who try to answer these questions, the people who probe into the internal mechanisms within the human brain. The discovery of these intricate processes will eventually yield many great things for human kind, but until then we'll just have to wonder what and how other people think. Electrical impulses jumping from cell to cell can be recorded, but translate that into thought and emotion. Things get hectic. And if we find out how everything about how we think, we will become predictable, and part of being human is having this unpredictable "free will". <br /><br />May the world never discover these elements that define our humanity. <br /><br />The sun will come up tomorrow and I'll live another day up. If this keeps on happening, I don't know where I'll be. And I find that scary. I find not knowing what to do scary. Not knowing what to do, what to study, where to go, how to act when things inevitably turn sour. The destination is not set, I'm not working toward anything long-term. There isn't a mission, so I'm sort of drifting. I figure, drifting isn't safe, especially in the aggressive waters of today, so there is something to fear in the deviation from a long-term goal that doesn't even exist.<br /><br />
