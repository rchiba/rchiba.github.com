I don't like my keyboard. I don't think it types too well. The keyboards at school feel more responsive. Softer and more refined. The one I'm using is an old keyboard that came from a budget '02 Dell system. It feels like I'm hacking away words with rough and sticky clicks.<br /><br />Anyways, there are horrible days, decent days, and very good days. Today was a very good day. It's one of those days I always wish for, I dream for. I'm so grateful that as I think back on my day, I don't remember a single thing that went wrong. Classes trotted by at a pleasurable speed. Not too fast, not too slow. I was in a positive mood, didn't have any social crises. Interviewed two people, which was great. I finally have material to build from. I don't feel helpless anymore. I also found four of the books I've been missing. This is a very amazing thing.<br /><br />After school, Ryan and I were finishing our French homework when his dad suggested that we go to the football game. Not being much of a sports person, I brushed the idea off. But, after a few minutes I realized something. By six, we were off to pick Tiffany up.<br /><br />Her eyes, her voice, her smile. As Ryan was driving Tiffany and me to the football game, I felt much too lucky to be relaxed. It took us all a while to get around town. She lives on the other side of town, but was it worth it. When she holds my hand and looks at me that way, I want to flash freeze that moment and keep it forever. They have no price, these are the moments that I will treasure in the future as memories. Going to the football game was worth it. I think I'm almost fully adjusted to being completely open to the status of our relationship. At first, it was awkward to talk about how we're dating. Now, I've come to know that embracing the fact is easier than it seems. It's how it happened. I can't control love. I sure am glad how everything turned out though.<br /><br />I look in my backpack and realize that I'm missing two books. The loss don't seem so unpleasant after all the positive things that happened today. I'm worried yes, but I'll solve my own problems. After all, what are books but dead trees?
