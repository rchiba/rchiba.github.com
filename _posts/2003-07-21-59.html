Good morning folks.
<br />Today is a cloudy day and it seems like it has rained last night.  I went to walk my dog and my sandals got wet and when I walked into the garage, I slipped. My legs still hurt. I am covered in mosqito bites everywhere because it is summer. I wish the mosqitos would not eat blood.
