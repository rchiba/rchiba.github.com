I don't wish to die, so why do I think about it? Why do I blame everything on myself? Why does this rage tremble within me? I can't stand it. I can't stand it at all. I feel so alone, and yet only a few minutes ago I was happy as a lark, drawing on a drawing board on the internet. I just don't understand. I guess it's because I am thinking. I feel as thought he is overstepping his boundaries. I don't want a dad. I don't want a dad yet. I can't stand it. My wounds are still too fresh. Yes, I know he care,s I'm sick, but I don't need someone to feed me medicine like a stupid little baby who can't take care of itself. I don't like it. It's freaking me out. I know he care,s but I'm freaked out. 
<br />I'm also sick of the drinking. Charlene doesn't like it either, at least they're downstairs and they leave me alone. As long as they do that I'm fine. Just make them leave me alone, and I'm fine. I hate this. I'm shaking. WHY?! Why the sod am I shaking? I have done nothing or looked upon nothing to make me shake. My hands are cold, yes, maybe that is it. Maybe this is coldness. I don't know. I'm so confused. I'm so very confused. I don't want a dad. I don't. I don't. I'm not ready. No one hears that, I'm not ready!!!!!!!!!! 
<br />I know, I'm overdoing it. I just, it's, I feel so inaudible. So silent, so like a tiny insect. I don't matter.
<br />I guess everything is catching up. I don't want it to. I need Sunny. I need to talk to her. She always helps make it go away.
<br />Mom was talking. She's going to set up an appointment for me to see Him again. I don't want to. I don't want everything to go to the surface. I want to be like everyone else, perfect happy. But that's never happened. I'll never be happy. I'm so confused. Why is there nothing here? Is this my soul? Nothing? emptiness? An echoing shadow of my life, full of pain, suffering, misery???!!! What more is there? What else can I offer to anything. What... What...What?1 is there anything. No. No, there is nothing. nothing nothing nothing. I'm just nobody, it is who I want to be right now. 
<br />I fear Contessa hates me. She never talks to me, doesn't care. But in her position, I wouldn't either. She may be able to feel her emotions unlike myself, but her family's problems are far more escalated than mine.
<br />I wonder what mom would say if I told her of my plans of moving out whenever possible. I wonder if she;d react the same way when I told her I didn't like being touched? Or maybe when I told her I hated being around her when she drank? I wonder if I would react the same way. Would I finally die or at least make myself bleed? Would I survive? Will I end up like Angela, the one I am constantly compared to?
<br />I dislike that, almost everyone compares me to my perfect big sister. She's always perfect. Always. Always. Always. 
<br />Except now. Now she is struggling.
<br />Like me?
<br />Am I struggling too? Am I too far gone to save? I'm not sure. I'm just sick of receiving long suffering looks when I don't eat. I'm not hungry. 
<br />Angela was.
<br />That's the difference. So sod off.

<br />I spent 81 minutes on it. I like it. an animated inner me.
<br />Where did I go off subject?
<br />I'm so confused. I will go to bed confused.
