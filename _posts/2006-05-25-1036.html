Day 1, The Lethargy Has Only Just Begun<br /><br />That's what I would name today, if every day had a title.<br /><br />At this point in time, life seems to be at a standstill. If I were to compare the chronicles of my life now to ones of a week ago, the past would seem so much more dynamic than the past. And, for the most part, this is true. As a new season has blanketed this great cornfield, a new lifestyle has as well (for me at least). A lifestyle of despair, a lifestyle of chronic tiredness. A lifestyle that's dim enough to be annoying. I sleep late, wake up late, and even then I must take a mid-day nap. School was so great because there were so many things that <i>went on</i> that simply do not happen now. However much I try, I maintain  approximately zero true interpersonal conversations, while intrapersonal communications seem to be declining as well, proportional to my decrease in mental ability.<br /><br />Haze. A dark haze of confusion. It is as if I've been running for hours without a drink of water. That kind of dizzy, jumbled haze that covers the mind with a sort of thick pudding. I don't know what to blame. It could be just me adjusting to isolation, or it could be that the humidity is up. It could be a combination of the two, or rather the thousands of variables involved in determining one's mood at any given time.<br /><br />For the first time in a long time, I watched a movie all the way through. It's amazing to me how I managed to focus on doing absolutely nothing for more than an hour without feeling worthless. Even when I have nothing to do, I have to read something, or tape things to my wall, anything to keep things around me moving. I don't want my life to be static.<br /><br />Although, it seems like static is all I can manage to receive from my sleep-saturated mind.
