Six miles of bicycled road, two graphic novels, and one muffin later I'm sitting here.<br /><br />Ryan commented on how I draw well, but I'm still traumatized. Traumatized from when I simply, and constructively criticized someone's artwork. <br /><br />It all started with lunch. The day was just like any other one, which means starvation, obsessing over homework, and trying to keep Tiffany from being bored. Of course, I can understand why she's always like this. Not a single sane sophomore soul has been assigned to "Lunch A" besides us two. It's really quite a situation. But anyways, there are a handful of insane sophomores that sit with Tiffany and I. So, "Lori" takes out some really pretty anime drawing she inked and pencil-shaded. It looks nice, but the proportions are a tad off. <br /><br />She states, "Something's wrong with this drawing, but I'm not quite sure what."<br /><br />A discussion between Lori and a few other chit-chatty girls ensues. Tiffany joins in, and I feel out of place. Of course, this can be expected. I'm the only male at the table, and thus, I'm the oddball. Jokes about males and gossip are the usual staples at my lunch table microcosm. I just get caught in the fray, while I try to keep a low profile and retain my reputation.<br /><br />But, for some absurd reason, I decide to chime in this time. Not out of curiosity, and not out of an urge to talk, but out of the urge to constructively criticize some artwork.<br /><br />I've been obsessing over proportions for quite some time. A year perhaps. I browse a great variety of art forums, and there are always a nonstop supply of artists wanting help on proportions of bodies, weapons, armor, animals, etc. I read these every day and try to learn from the mistakes these other people make. I've gotten to the point where I can somewhat efficiently identify most errors in most proportionally incorrect drawings.<br /><br />So, I chip in and say, "The subject's hips are too wide, the elbow is below her hip, which is obviously not correct, and her ear is attached to the subject's cheek."<br /><br />Terrible mistake. Apparently, my two cents ends up being an explosive bash on Lori's art skills. I get whacked down by a purse or two, slapped, and otherwise assaulted. Unable to do anything about it, I admit defeat and get back to work reading my book. I swear, the lunch table microcosm that I inhabit is that of a brutal dictatorship. I, the common man, am being oppressed by tyranical feminazis. A few slanderous jokes and fifteen minutes later, the lunch period is over. <br /><br />Why do people become insane hermits? High school, that's why.
