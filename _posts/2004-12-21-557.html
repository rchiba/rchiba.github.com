I got a high grade on my biology final today, a 98.2%. Unfortunately, Andrew got a 102%, because of the curve. I am now officially a "failure", according to the quizbowl team. Everyone has over 100% in every class (which is supposed to be impossible, you know, kind of because 100% is 100%) and I don't. I only have a measly 97%. Yup, I'm a real failure.
<br />
<br />Anyways, Zach asked me a good question today. He said, "If you had to kill one person right now, who would you kill?" My obvious answer was no one, but I had to kill someone. I would probably sacrifice myself. If I killed someone else, that would just make me a failure, in a socialistic sense. I would be a detriment to humankind. It would result in anger, vengeance, sad desperation. Why let anyone else suffer? You know, that's why you don't want to be a hitman, sniper, soldier, or assasin. You are forced to kill people. That's what you're life revolves around. Better to be a con than a killer.

<br />Tomorow is band finals, which means easy bliss for most of the day. I have to get my hair cut tomorow. Getting haircuts always makes me look like an elementary school kid. It really does. People at school think I'm one of those uber-smart 6th graders from a middle school. I hate that.
<br />
<br />I searched for "hate" on my blog today and found that I hate alot of things. Maybe I should be less self-concious. Maybe I should give in to... them. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, my next door neighboor's little sister (1st grade) was pressuring my sister to go to her house so they could play. The only problem is that the kid next door has chickenpox and a skin infection. Guess what she used as an incentive... Popularity. That kid is a degraded mind dubbed TV propagandaized child. Popularity. She doesn't even care about my sister. She's so full of herself. She doesn't care if my sister gets chickenpox and suffers. She doesn't care about the concequences. She doesn't understand that there's something else in the world BESIDES HER. She should relize that before she starts to mature. Absurd and demented kids... sheesh.
