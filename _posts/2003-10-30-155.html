Um....Heh...I'm part of the team! Yay! Let us all be happy!
<br />.....
<br />Fine.
<br />Right. 'bout me. The semi-quiet artist of ETMS!
<br />.....
<br />o.k.! So I'm loud most of the time! sue me here peoples....
<br />O.k. um. To report, my Halloween costume is finished! Let us all cheer....Yeah. My Mom got pretty agitated and scary.
<br />More bad news. (jeez, I'm not so happy now O.O;) I tried biking a mile or at LEAST half a mile like I used to, but I just can't surpass the pain in my legs. My Mom says we really need to get them looked at, but I don't really look forward to it.
<br />Why?
<br />Doctors are evil.
<br />don't look at me like that, lol. They are! evil, evil, EEEEVVVIIIIL!
<br />O.k., my rant is over, and I have joined the team. I will update at least once a week as long as I don't have a mental breakdown and someone ELSE important to me doesn't die. 
<br />yeah.
<br />Um... *gets in news anchor voice* This has been Amanda reporting, now signing off... Um... g'night everybody!
