I must be crazy.<br /><br />After a few grueling hours of typing up a chemistry paper, I sit here refreshed. I shouldn't be. I should be sitting here, complaining about how tiring and absurd the paper was, but it's not like that today. The page I wrote about radiation sickness must have gotten to my head because now, I have the incessant urge to write papers. I mean, thinking about it, it's not all that bad. The research, flipping through pages in a textbook, the ambient noise of classical music, jotting down notes, typing up thoughts. Still tedious, but so naturual. Writing makes life flow as if it were one cohesive liquid with no distinct shape, but still attached to the rigors of school and regulations. <br /><br />The paper writing was good. At least, perhaps, I'm trying to tell myself this to make my life seem happier. It works sometimes, but sometimes I catch on to myself, finding my attempts at brainwashing stupid. Sometimes, I can't stand myself.<br /><br />Especially when I work on homework. You see, whenever I speak to my peers, their homework is finished. You know why? Because I am inferior. I am not as efficient as "everyone else" and thus, I am a failure. I take longer to do the same quality of work. I'm like some outdated machine, stripped of dignity and pride, chained down my time and the appearance of those who are better suited for work. I sit here, obsolete, those who are close to me, all are superior, and I'm this sick, disgusting pile of flesh, trying to compete with those I idol, never reaching the near-perfection that they achieve. It's truely a sad, sad story.<br /><br />My homework shouldn't trouble me, but it does. There are many things that I "shouldn't" be or "shouldn't" think, but I do. I "shouldn't", but the better word should be "can't". I "can't" do my homework efficiently, I "can't" communicate to those around me well, I "can't" make strides in life, only clumsy hobbles. <br /><br />You know, I tried to make myself feel better, but it just didn't work out, did it? Well, back to the gulag, and back to feeling hopeless.
