I am sorry I'm not updating.
<br />
<br />It's just that diving and homework consumes me. My own leisure activities also consume me. I know, this is supposed to be my leisure, but I'm starting to drift around. Everything is consuming me and all I can do is drift!? What am I to do?!
<br />
<br />Anyways, once diving is over, my life will become it's peaceful, angry self. Upon which I will update this blog regularly again. Don't expect me to post much in the next week because this and next week are diving weeks. Everything after that should procede roughly to plan. Hopefully...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I will post when I can, but don't check like every 30 minutes (like anyone does anyways. I mean, I'm such a mediocre writer....)
<br />
<br />Well, I have to sleep and dream about a world without diving.
