Hey, Justin thanx for the update!
<br />Anyways, I have found out what I really want. (dramatic music plays) ..... A tape recorder! This way, I can keep track of my thoughts so I can put them in this blog ( I always seem to forget my ideas) and make documentaries of popular people. I can just immagine recording every bad thing that the popular people say and turning them into the school. That would be sooooo great. The satisfaction I would feel... I have become a "Not Milk" activist. You should visit the not milk site on my links part of the site. Your life will be changed forever...
