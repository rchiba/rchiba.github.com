I only have 5 minutes to type, like a lot of days this week.
<br />
<br />Today I have written a very long story, with the help of Adam Atter. I think I shall post it just for your enjoyment. Here it is:
<br />
<br />Plink...plink...plink
<br />	This was the by-product of a company party come to an end. Half empty glasses containing cheap wine, crusted with a sheath of white and red from lipstick and a tablecloth that was only half on the table. Only a few hours ago full of fervor and excitement, now the room was only the ashes and embers of the party. The clock slowly ticked to the inevitable strike of midnight, my dismissal. The room was empty, dim, and messy. It was now my time to start working.
<br />	Here I was, in this godforsaken party, wondering why I was here in the first place. Some might think I live to clean, wash, and dry. Others consider me the scum of the earth. Unable to succeed in my own art, I did the next best thing. This thing was to become the head janitor in the most famous museum in France. Yes, I have to clean after those who hate me, but it is all worth it because I get to look at the art. This is the incentive to work the night shift every day. 
<br />	I noticed a glass, tipped over on the table. Its contents dripped into the nearby trash bin. Leaning over to inspect the mess, I noticed a crumpled ball in the corner of my eye. It seemed to be a ball of paper. Upon unfolding it, I found a neatly cut newspaper article. Its headline you ask? 
<br />
<br />"Government Slashes Funding. Transit and Museums Hit Hard"
<br />
<br />	Odd... I quickly put it into my large cart full of trash. Next, I folded the sheets of tablecloth and put them aside, along with the haphazard scattering of glasses. As I tried to make order of this mess, the curator, monsieur Pierre, came in. He strutted along, in a slow gliding fashion, as if he were on oiled skis. He is dressed in a fine overcoat, the buttons, ornate in every way. He strutted up to me.
<br />"Janitor, you are dismissed. It is far too late for you to be cleaning!" monsieur Pierre says.
<br />"But sir, there is more to be do..."
<br />"You have done enough. You are dismissed." the Pierre interrupts.
<br />He walked away, assuming that my orders will be executed. He says for me to go home, so I shall. As I walked home that night I thought of how I am just a peon to him... just a lowly janitor.
<br />The next morning, I wake to the sound of a motorcycle. It is cherry red, with a package on the back. The driver I assumed was a courier. As she took off her helmet, her flaming red hair shows off its luster. As she dropped off her package I got a glimpse of her face. It was familiar, but I know that I do not know her, for I didn't know any couriers. It was a new day and I got ready for work. 
<br />As I walked down the age-old streets, I admired the rustic neighborhood I live in, Renaissance Lane. Houses fit for DaVinci lined the streets. One house caught my eye. Obviously abandoned and outdated, it suffered from degeneration. I could still make out the ornate carvings on the walls, the gargoyles silently calling for a restoration. The plaque reading 1512 Renaissance Lane still hung from one peg, slightly slanted. I wondered why it was abandoned, as it was a beautiful building.
<br />	I finally made it to the museum. I saw the curator arrive in his flashy convertible just as I reach the marble columns that support the museum. Obviously, he has spent more money than usual on his car. As I observed him, I saw him hand something to a courier. A tip perhaps? 
<br />I entered the museum, I notice there were not a lot of people. I slowly made my way up to the supply closet where I gathered my supplies. I then took the utility cart and progressed with my cleaning. By the time I was finished, it was evening. I was on my last leg of my cleaning journey. I made it to the second floor. As I was buffing the floor, I decide to take a quick break. Cleaning is exhausting, but I almost got to my favorite part of the day. As I looked down below at the sporadic groups weaving in and out of the exhibits, I started wondering what they are thinking. I see a thick-framed man with blonde hair like a movie star. I could tell that he was American because of his ripped jeans and his gelatinous hair. I also saw a small child. Excitedly running to each exhibit, the child stopped occasionally to glance at a work of art. Too small to understand the meaning of the paintings, he jumped up and down, impatiently waiting for his parents to catch up. Then I turned my head and glanced at the next visitor. This time it was a group of three. I notice one was the curator, the other was a red haired teenager, and the other is, from the looks of it, a wealthy old man. I assumed that the curator is giving a personal tour. It is something he does to guests he has a liking to. He occasionally, he pointed up to a painting and looked to the teenager. She nodded yes or no. I wondered why.
<br />		I got back on the job, buffing and scrubbing the floors.  A monotonous job to say the least but while doing it I get to examine and admire the various exhibits.  Those days it seems like the paintings just don’t have their certain allure anymore.  I assumed that it’s just because I’ve was looking at them every day, but it still seemed peculiar that masterpieces I once treasured now do no feel as close to me.
<br />	As I walked home that night I noticed that the package the flame-haired courier had dropped off was no longer sitting in the alley it was before.  In its place was an old briefcase.  There was one thing askew in this picture though.  The old briefcase, instead of having old rusty clasps, had brand new locks.  Although this was puzzling, I did not let a trivial matter like that trouble me.  It was probably a drug-drop; there have been many drug busts by the judicial police, the FJPD, in the past few months.  I often wonder what this once charming city is becoming.
<br />	The next day at the museum things droned on as usual until about midmorning when I noticed monsieur Pierre  hovering about a closed wing of the museum.  That wasn’t odd: it happens every day in a different wing so the great works can be checked for degeneration.  What infuriated me was that monsieur Pierre was taking pictures of the art.  That was strictly forbidden even to the highest ranked officials because the flash increased the process of aging.  I went over to confront him and he nearly took my head off with his response.
<br />“Monsieur Pierre what are you doing?  You know better than anyone that no photos are allowed here in the museum!" I said.
<br />“I do not need to be corrected by the likes of you, janitor! I know perfectly well of the rules in this establishment.  Now get back to your toilet scrubbing or whatever it is you should be doing at the moment!” said monsieur Pierre
<br />“Yes sir,” I replied,”please excuse me.”
<br />I did not report monsieur Pierre because no one would believe me.  Yes, there are countless security cameras in the museum, but none of them are actually functioning.  That would be much too costly and too much of a hassle to man each monitor.  The focus these days was to keep thieves in, not out.  If a certain amount of pressure is applied to any work in the museum gargantuan gates slam down and trap the criminal in that particular wing.  The only person who can bypass these gates is the curator himself with a special key he keeps in his back pocket.
<br />	Later that day I went back and was amazed that monsieur Pierre was again doing something to damage the art. He was taking even more pictures of the art.   All but one of the works were very minor pieces, very few people appreciated these works.  A few small statues and a couple paintings were all.  The piece I was surprised monsieur Pierre even dared take a picture of was “Madonna of the Rocks”, one of the most famous DaVinci’s ever, rivaled only by “The Mona Lisa” herself.
<br />	As I was staring at “Madonna of the Rocks” to try to figure out what he was photographing, I noticed something terribly wrong.  There was a hair stuck in the painting, actually half covered in the dried paste. This was a very strange occurrence. Many of the impressionists would not even think of working in an environment where a thing as simple as a hair could destroy their soon-to-be masterpiece.  As if to prove me right, the hair stuck in the painting was a brilliant red color, not the brown-blonde color historians and art specialists believed DaVinci to have. I rushed to immediately notify monsieur Pierre.
<br />	I soon arrived to Pierre's office. Hesitating for a moment to decide if I should continue, I remember that the art is the first priority. Slowly opening the door, mostly expecting to be yelled at some more, I entered. Unfortunately, monsieur Pierre was not present at his office. Being a poorly funded museum, you would expect the offices to be cheap as well. That was not the case for Pierre's office. Ornate carvings on a large marble desk sat in the corner while large brushed metal columns towered over my head, as if they were trying to deter me from going any further. After I admired his room I noticed something on the floor. It was a letter. Of course, it was nothing new. Occasionally, the office personnel drop miscellaneous letters. I am instructed to return them to Pierre's desk for them to be given back to their original owners. But as I was walking to Pierre's desk to lay the letter down, I noticed something very peculiar. The return address was marked: 1512 Reassurance Lane. 
<br />	There must have been a mistake. This address was of the building near mine. Surely there wouldn't have been occupants inside of there, or have there? I looked inside of the envelope to find a letter reading:
<br />	"Thank you for your business with me. I am very pleased with your products. The transactions are complete with the fee you requested below." 
<br />	Below the letter was a check for 500,000 euros. What product does the museum sell, and why is this product 500,000 euros? The gift store has nothing over 100 euros, and certainly nothing costing 500,000 euros. What is going on here? Just then, Pierre storms in.
<br />	"What are you doing in my office?! Why have you that letter!?" Pierre barked.
<br />	"Monsieur Pierre, I was just cleani"
<br />	"Janitor, what have you read. What have you found out?" Pierre interrupted.
<br />	Just then, my brain screeched to a halt. The synapses in my head no longer fired on and off. Complete astonishment and surprise filled my mind as all of the clues came together, fitting together in my mind like an intricate puzzle. The government budget cuts, extravagant parties, the courier, the abandoned house, Pierre's new car, the hair in the painting, all came together to form one big story.
<br />	"I cannot let you escape. Thank you for your service as a janitor." Pierre solemnly spoke.
<br />	I knew then that I had to escape the museum and notify authorities, before I became a clue myself. I lunged for the door, Pierre grabbing me. Only able to grab my coat and rip it off, he immediately sets off the alarm system, therefore closing the walls and trapping me, like a rat in a maze.
<br />	Barreling through the hallways, I manage to reach my utility closet. I immediately locked the door and looked at my options. As I frantically try to find something to defend myself with, I noticed a glimmer. A minute twinkle of light entered my eye. It was utility key. Under the disinfectant, and resting on top of the soap bucket, the utility key stuck out. The utility key was a key that the museum personnel use to open a back door to disable the alarm, in case of a false alarm. I grabbed it and realized my only hope for escape was a back door on the other side of the museum. My heart was a timpani playing fortissimo as I slowly turned the knob to open the door. When I opened the door I noticed that Pierre was staring me in the face as I trembled in terror. He held a crow bar.
<br />	"Sorry, but you cannot leave." Pierre muttered.
<br />	I knew I had to get out so I tackled Pierre and shot through the hallways like a ricocheting bullet. As I ran into walls and grabbed wall corners to stabilize myself, Pierre chased me with the same wall to wall frenzy. I finally made it to the back door. With Pierre only a few seconds behind me, I frantically stuck the key into the slot, opened the door, got out, shut the door, and locked it up. As I was turning the key to lock him inside, Pierre slammed into the door, cursing and shouting. 
<br />	Since Pierre was taken care of, I my next mission was to get to the police station. In the parking lot in front of me, I noticed the same cherry red motorbike I noticed before, with the same courier. Was the courier part of this mess? I decided to confront her.
<br />	"Tell me the truth, why have you been involved in this crime?"
<br />	"I have to earn a living somehow." she calmly said.
<br />	She then took her helmet off, and I was astounded by her age. She was only about 16, barely old enough to drive the motorbike, nonetheless able to participate in such fraudulent activities. 
<br />	"If you drive me to the police station now, I will not tell them about your participation in this crime," I offered.
<br />	"How can I trust you?" she asked.
<br />	"Just trust me."
<br />	She then drove me to the police station upon which I reported monsieur Pierre's fraudulent activities and showed the police my letter. Then, I left the police station. As I walked into the parking lot, the cherry red motorbike and its passenger were absent from the myriad of parked cars. 
<br />	Later, Pierre was arrested for art smuggling and attempted murder. Another curator was hired and the museum got back its art. The purchasers of the art were also arrested and put in prison. As for the courier, there have been reports of similar crimes elsewhere in Europe, and to this day, she is still missing.
