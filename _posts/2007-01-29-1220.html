I read in a book somewhere that you can improve your level of <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">happiness</span> if you take the time to think of three things that you are grateful for each day.  But, I'll wait until I'm <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">desperate</span>. I need to save up my happiness energy. Right now, I'm in that "<span style="font-style: italic;">I don't care, blah, blah, blah</span>" attitude that appears to invade the life of everyone nowadays. Just floating along, not really anchored to a goal or a task or a mission.<br /><br />I felt jealous today. I felt dark today. I felt worried. But, I also felt lucky. And I felt satisfied.<br /><br />It's just a mix, you know? And you can really pull anything from it, besides the idea that all of this really doesn't matter. Next week, it'll be the same deal.
