What would happen if all life on Earth suddenly vanished and the only thing left would be the unaltered remains of our civilization? What would an alien race think of our civilization?<br /><br />They would probably see large banks, guarding a yellowish metal and green rags, they would think that this civilization had some kind of cult fetish about metals and rags. They would see our unoperational electronics, built to run on energy that would eventually run out, and they would criticize our shortsightedness. They would see our lavish cars and pointless lawn decorations, and would point and wonder why someone would create something so useless. They would see our giant warehouses full of unused goods and make fun of our wastefulness. They would see our dilapidated ghettos and ritzy mansions and look down on our social divisions. They would look at our sophisticated books and technology, and then glance back at the poor living conditions and the poor conditions of many ecological habitats and realize that we had skewed priorities. Flaws can be seen better without the people who created them. We only hear what we want to hear. A cure-all pill? We buy it for three easy payments of $19.99, even though we realize that it will not work. A new car that runs on hydrogen? We support it and hype it up, even though anyone with a logical brain can figure out that we'll still have to conjure up massive electricity to convert water into hydrogen. That electricity will come from primarily coal and oil plants. A new wireless router that goes a trazillion bits per second? We buy it, but at the same time realize that our computer ports will not be able to utilize such idealistic protocols. <br /><br />It's a time to realize that there is no cure-all pill. It's time to realize that making a faster router and wireless adapter won't make your work any more efficient if you fake that sick day. It's time to realize that hydrogen energy will never work. Let's all realize that it only takes living in North Korea for a year to get you back into those high school jeans. As everyone starves themselves to reach idealistic, but pointless and vain goals for their body, I sit here and ponder, is there really logic to this madness?
