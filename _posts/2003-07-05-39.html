Hello, this is ryo chiba again. I just watched Gangs Of New York and it was very bloody. It was a pretty good movie though. It is getting dark outside and I hate the thought of being a day closer to school. S-C-H-O-O-L. NOT GOOD.HOMEWORK.NOT GOOD. Oh well... at school I will have social interaction with other human beings. That is always nice. ohhhhhhhhhhhh. I look outside the window and i see pink. So beautiful. Like a National Geographic picture or something. Beautiful.
