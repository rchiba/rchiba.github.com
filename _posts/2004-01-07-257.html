It really stinks because Amanda has moved 2 seats behind me.
<br />I know that's pretty close, but we can't talk as much. I'm afraid to download AOL (after the horrid, antisocial things it did to me) and that's what amanda has. The only form of casual communication now is MSN Messenger. AMANDA IF YOU ARE READING THIS, PLEASE TURN ON MSN MESSENGER WHEN YOU GO ON THE INTERNET, THANK YOU. Anyways, I talked to this girl (I guess she's a bit cute, I'm going to regret that...) at lunch and she informed me that she looks on my website. Maybe I should censor this site, but maybe not. An artist must express themselves however possible. Anyways, the new poll is up so vote on it.
<br />
<br />My palmIIIxe phase is working well. Not to many people are going the way I have expected, which is good. I expected the exaggerated nonsense of shoulting and proclamations that I have a palm pilot. This result would in-turn get attention to my palm pilot consequently causing a teacher to take it away. Since that has not happened, I am grateful that everyone has actually matured. Also, there is distraction on the bus because the Islamic kid beside me is always being teased unfairly about his religeon and his music prefrences. Because of this, attention is directed toward him and I can peacefully study the periodic table on my Palm. I have devised a code system so far...
<br />Code Blue: Attention/Publicity threat, keep your heads low and brace yourselves...
<br />Code Red:... I can't remember
<br />Code Green: I hate the person beside me, someone help
<br />Code Purple: Teacher in the vacinity, use caution when using vulgar words
<br />Code Orange:....Who knows?....
<br /> I can't remember some of the stuff I think of at school because I study all this stuff and the extra info pushes the extra knowledge out of my cranium. I hope I can talk to Amanda soon. Bye everyone....;)
