Hello everybody. 
<br />It is about an hour before school starts and I officially step upon the bus. Tick Tick Tick. The time keeps ticking as I speak. I am pretty nervous. I had all these bad dreams last night, about school. School is getting close... closer... closest...  
<br />
<br />That is all.
<br />And oh yea, best wishes to all that go to East Tipp Middle School! Good Luck, and try to stay alive;)
