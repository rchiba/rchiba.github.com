Going nuts over chemistry isn't going to help me live longer, that's for sure, but it's just so hard to be so fearless in the face of such a dangerous subject.<br /><br />Chemistry itself isn't dangerous, but the homework issued and grading structure is a minefield of lethal risks and perils. Any false step will result in a large chunk of my grade being exploded into nothingness. Any forgetful mistake will land me in mental shame and agony. Any wrong choices, and I'm done for.<br /><br />So, what's the fuss? I mean, it's high school. How hard could it be? <br /><br />Well, that's just it. It's not really all that hard, but I just make it seem like such a hazard that I spend hours glaring at my book, pulling my hair out, turning the music up louder, trying to make the words on the page vibrate away. But, they never do, and I always end up having sleepless nights of fear. Not the kind of fear that's just an adrenaline spike in your blood. Not that kind of quick, energetic fear. This is the kind of fear that's more of a elongated, expanded sort of worry. The kind of fear that dwells deep inside of one's gut, slowly expanding to eventually constrict the abdomen, and then the throat. The dark, slow pain. Dull pain.<br /><br />And so, tonight will be just like all of the rest. Another semi-sleepless night. Kudos to you, Chemistry. <br /><br />You've done your job beautifully.
