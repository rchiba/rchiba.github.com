I felt particularly mystical today.<br /><br />Well, I only felt mystical for the last few hours of today. <br /><br />As I returned home from yet another ego-shattering QuizBowl meet, I felt frustrated. Anger was welling up inside of me, and I was considering buying a one-way airplane ticket to Japan. There, I could be a homeless biker, exploring and adventuring along the mountain roads with a scrapped bicycle. I could be whoever I wanted, go wherever I feel, meet who I want, learn from experience. I could climb mountains, scavenge in junkyards, and experience new things. The fresh air, the blue sky, the grass swaying to and fro in the country fields of soybeans. The lethargic scent that penetrates the humid, muggy air on a sweltering Japanese summer could finally envelop me in its comforting mass. My incessant romanticism of Japan is soon ended when I plop back into home base. My office chair, an old laptop, a stereo, and piles of homework. <br /><br />After rummaging through my poorly organized binder, I find that I forgot my Algebra II homework in my locker. Panic, mindless running in circles, and general chaos ensues. I decide to email all of my buddies asking for the problem numbers. <br /><br />Too bad the cable connection conked out. By now, I'm a furious mess. Ryan calls, I get frustrated and throw the phone at my couch. Feeling slightly guilty, I call him back, making the excuse that his service must have been interrupted. My seething rage is quelled a bit, but as soon as I put the phone down and realize that my homework is still not completed, I'm back to my pessimistic, crazed self. Pacing, I try to figure out a solution. <br /><br />I tell myself to calm down. I tell myself that anger is irrational. I brainwash myself into drowning my emotions, killing them off, and I do. Soon, I'm as automated as a robot in a car factory, churning out homework. Tedious still, but I just keep chugging along, until I look up. It's pitch black outside, very dark. Thunderstorms that I didn't notice earlier are now above my head, looming over me like a deathly illness. The lightning and thunder occasionally rattle me, and I try to quell my strung up nerves. <br /><br />Well, like I said, I was feeling a bit mystical today. I should attribute this to a book I am reading in my English class. It's some hispanic mystical realism novel. We're over-analyzing it as usual, and I find it to be a complete bore. But, somewhere deep inside, I was influenced by this novel. I felt like doing something orphic and random. I thought about lighting candles in my room and chanting incantations, but I decided against it, since I have a primal fear of smoke. I decided to go biking.<br /><br />The rain pittered and pattered as I pushed the button to open my garage. As the cold night air started to seep into my lungs, I was further compelled to start my adventure. I grabbed by bike, and set off into the darkness.<br /><br />Making my way down the hill, I was instantly thrilled and comforted. I sliced through the cold air and water  like a knife, cutting in and out. The water, seeping into my skin, entering my lungs, the coldness hugging my body, the wind, so vibrant, the thunder, so reassuring. I kept riding through the black abyss. <br /><br />I start to think, perhaps this is true bliss. Pure freedom of one's self. Finding one's center in the darkness. There is no sense of direction or speed, but the feeling is exhilarating. My money, social status, homework, and future don't matter here in the black of night. Nothing really matters, except your spirit. There was no physical body, no entity to be worried about, just the soul speeding through the depths of darkness. Speeding down another hill, I start to feel cleansed. Cleansed by the clean water from the sky, cleansed by the pure, night air.<br /><br />I'm drenched as I start to cruise home. I feel enriched, somehow feeling oddly optimistic and happy. The cold did not hinder my joy, as I pedaled along the smooth waterlogged road.<br /><br />Perhaps what I learned today is this. Life isn't about accomplishing “goals” set by your peers or your mother or your father. Life is about you, and you choose where to go. There is no failure in life, but only the failure to enjoy it.
