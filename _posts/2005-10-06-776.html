It's really funny...<br /><br />You know...<br /><br />How I'm chained to my room, for hours and hours, doing homework. Mindless things really. The kind of homework that one should just brush through.<br /><br />And it's truely funny how it's all my fault. The time I spend doing mundane things like trying to understand my chemistry is mindboggling. I can't attribute my inability to do my homework efficiently to politics, pesticides, or violent video games, so what else is there to blame besides me? <br /><br />Another thing that's funny is that people think I'm "smart". It's silly how deceiving my extended vocabulary is. I see people around me getting all of their homework done in a matter of thirty minutes, and get comparable grades. So, when I get home and take three hours to do a worksheet that should have taken me fifteen minutes, it's frustrating. Sitting there, feeling inferior.<br /><br />Not just feeling inferior. More like knowing that I'm inferior, because how else can you explain or justify my inability to accomplish mental tasks, such as understanding abstract concepts? It's unacceptable, my failure to be as fast as everyone else, and yet I continue to live, accepting the unacceptable. Trying to hate myself, and succeeding, all the while knowing that my hate just slows me down even more. It's a self perpetuated hate-fest. A life full of blame and stupid self-esteem issues. <br /><br />One cannot achieve things by constantly bickering with one's self. <br /><br />And that's the kind of stuff I tell myself to get me to focus. It used to work, but it's getting harder. Perhaps it's like conditioning the mind to reject the rational, intellectual thoughts that try to manifest the mind. The only thing that saturates my mind these days is homework and rage. <br /><br />But of course, I go to school every day, somehow manage to make the impression that I'm intelligent, go home and struggle for hours on worksheets, throw my calculator at the wall, and quickly fall asleep. <br /><br />It doesn't make any sense. I'm sure there are lots more people than me that lead much more difficult lives. It's completely irrational, like I said. <br /><br />But of course, reason is never as powerful as rage.<br /><br />And that's the funny part.
