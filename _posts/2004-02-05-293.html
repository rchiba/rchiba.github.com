Average Yo reporting in
<br />Anyways, I had a nervous breakdown in Communications class. It was a very nervous breakdown indeed. Let me explain the scenario. Anyways, the teacher was passing out our test scores on our "ancient greek myth" tests. I got the highest grade in the whole 8th grade (which is pretty surprising, considering that it was about myths and all). Anyways, I was glad, untill Morgan found out about it. I was just basking in my little pool of sunshine (which is pretty amazing since I haven't experienced sunshine in a long time) and then Morgan started rolling her eyes and literally screaming out my test score and making me look terrible. Making me feel terrible. It made me feel like a truly bad person, just because I got a good grade on a test. It made me so unbearably terrible (I have no idea why I was so unbearabley terrible). Everyone was looking at me with their menacing glances. Inside, I felt as though I was a murderer or I commited some horrific crime. Of course, the crime was getting a good score on my test. Morgan just kept telling and telling, then I decided to take action. I screamed to her to shut up and then I started crying. I cried with a smiling face to make everyone think I was phsychotic (I have  no idea why I would want other people to think that). And I just silently cried while smiling intensely. Then this girl (a very mean/annoying girl, by the way) kept asking me if I wanted to trade her seats (which is illegal) . She had the stupidity/persistance to ask this while I was menacingly crying and smiling. Obviously, I looked very purturbed and I was not to be a person to be messed with. She kept asking. Like she was some moron who didn't understand that I was having a mental breakdown. SHE JUST WOULDN"T STOP ASKING. Then I just exclaimed, "WHAT DO YOU THINK?, NO!". It seemed to have a negative effect because she got all angry and Morgan got all angry. I was hated by the whole class just because I refused something against the rules and because I got a good grade on a test. I followed all standard protocols and procedures, but these people just hated me. They might as well throw knives at me. Well, that's Communications class for today.
<br />
<br />Also, I went to after school mathcounts. Of course, me being the dumbest, we took a team round. 4 of the best nerds against 4 of the worst nerds. I was in the worst nerds group. By some strange chance, we won by a MILE. Now my confidence is reassured, but tomorow is a different game. Tomorow brings new challenges, new hazards, new death threats, new saddness...
<br />
<br />I really question my mental status. It seems like everyone hates me for doing good things. Maybe if I died, people would be happy. Maybe, but we'll never find out, because I'll just keep living, no matter how hard life gets.
