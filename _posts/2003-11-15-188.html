Sorry I haven't been updating. The wedding went great, except for one thing.
<br />On Friday morning i woke up sicker than a dog. It was horrible with a capitol H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E!! I'm STILL sick and miserable. I have a really bad case of tonsillitis. I know this because I have spots on my tonsols (my mom checks them a lot -_-) 
<br />I wonder if this is how a de-tonsilised person with a high fever feels. At least my temperature hasn't skyrocketed to 102 again, that was a miserable time period. 
<br />Anyways, I got to miss school, I guess that is good. Too bad I had to be sick on my mom's wedding! >.< I was coughing during the ceremony...grr.
<br />Well, that is my update, bye!
<br />~Amanda
