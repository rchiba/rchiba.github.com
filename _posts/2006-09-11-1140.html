I go to sleep early. I wake up by myself twenty minutes earlier than I do with my alarm clock. Then the rest of my day turns out to be more comfortable than usual. Work doesn't <i>seem</i> as hard. Problems don't <i>feel</i> so hard to solve. The school just <i>looks</i> plain friendlier. There are still frustrating points, yes, but overall things <i>flowed</i> well today. But, it always seems when I'm having a positive experience, everyone else is angry, hurt, or some other mystifying emotion that I can't seem to understand (yes, the last emotion is a reference to you, Andrew Pfaff). <br /><br />My way, I took the day and did it my way. Not the way that just happens, but <i>my way.</i> I threshed and molded and seized the day. I didn't get anything significant done, I made a stupid error in math, I forgot <i>E=mc^2</i>, but hey, all those things don't matter. Nothing matters, and that's the kind of day I like. When I look at all the little conflicts in my life and crumple them up. Throw them away. Just to realize that these problems are insignificant... It takes a lot of pressure off. I like it.<br /><br />Twitched. I twitched when my French teacher mentioned the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers. Because I knew that she would start talking about how we <i>felt</i> on that day, and the days afterward. One-by-one, my peers answered with their stories of how they were afraid, how they felt angry, how they locked themselves in their rooms and cried, etc. I didn't say anything. Didn't say anything because I would probably offend someone. People are always angry when others don't think like them. I've accepted that and become quieter when public discussion of such emotionally volatile subjects are discussed.<br /><br />That week after those towers fell down, then the months afterward, I just wondered, "<i>Why is it still on television, why are still hearing about all of this, and why are those terrorist attack victims suddenly heroes?</i>". They happened to be in a bad place at a bad time. Hundreds of people die from car accidents because they were at the wrong place at the wrong time. None of <i>them</i> are heroes. Circumstance. The people who performed acts of courage in times of dire need were brave, courageous. But, enough to be called a hero? What is a hero anyways? If I die by chance in some one-of-a-kind terrorist extravaganza, then am I a hero? <br /><br />Before lunch, there was a special announcement on the school televisions to remind us of the WTC attacks. After watching the poorly made slideshow of the buildings exploding, there was a long awkward silence with a sans-serif font message on the television. No sound. Nothing but text on the screen. The whole class is staring up at the television, time seems to drag on. The words on the screen read something like, "<i>Remember September 11, 2001.</i>"<br /><br />Absurd. I was about to explode in laughter from the absurdity of it all. I was biting through my lip, I'm sure I looked very inappropriate in a room full of somber, remorseful students. But, it's so absurd to me. Those who died being "honored" with a cheezy, poorly-made slideshow and awkward silence? I could have made that television presentation in five minutes with Windows Movie Maker. And if I died in those attacks, I sure wouldn't want my name to be honored with a seemingly endless silence. I felt like that was <i>the</i> stupidest, most pathetic excuse for a video memorial. <br /><br />Just hours earlier, my peers were describing to me how they went to their rooms to cry after those attacks. Look at us now, all we're doing to honor those victims are creating bland slideshows. <br /><br />Well, I bet there's logic to this. I just haven't got it yet. I don't understand a lot of things.
