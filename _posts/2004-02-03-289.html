Average Yo here,
<br />Anyways, I forgot to go to Mathcounts afterschool today. I feel stupid and guilty at the same time. I am so stupid. I really need to remember things. I went to Harrison High School today and I was overwhelmed. We had to plan our whole next year. I'm taking alot of things, but my ultimite goal is to get an Acedemic Honors Diploma. I hope I don't get one, but if I don't that's ok. I have all these honors courses I have to take and I hope I don't burn out. My dad said High School is for retards, so I shouldn't worry. 
<br />
<br />Well, we went on the field trip and got to High School. It was pretty freaky, I mean the auditorium was large, the cafeteria totally revamped, and the whole school vast, expanding past the horizons. I'm going to have to RUN to get from class to class. I had various panics today. I still can't believe that Shishir and Devin are going to West Lafayette High School. Oh well...
<br />
<br />I have to study for some tests, so after I do this, I should study. Also, I have to write an essay to update my opinions page. Devin is competing with me with his infamous AIM program. I hate that darned program. It has no purpose of existing. I hate it with all my heart. Anyways, today was scary, and people around me were even scarier. Also, I talked with Oliver, who is a pretty reasonable character and we share the same points on society. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, the clock is ticking and life is getting shorter. I forgot what I was going to talk about. Oh yea, Communications class is starting to become disturbing. People are always getting mad at me. They should just get their own room and hug a pillow or something. They say I am annoying, and of course, the oposite is true. Theres this girl who keeps mentioning my website and its deplorative aspects. I think that she should just be quiet. If she doesn't want to go to my website, that's her problem, not mine. She doesn't have to go to my website. Also, I have discovered that MANY more people know about my site than I intentionally wanted. They are spreading it to the teachers. Consequently, I am not safe writing things down. But I shall go on. If I write something bad on this site, I can disown it, but of course I cannot disown my own creation...My precious...
<br />
<br />I am reading the "Hobbit" in advanced english. I enjoy it, but we are going to have to do this huge project on our own "fantasy" world. We have to make up names and do a presentation. This is going to take creative skill, and that is what I don't have. I decided to take this class in high school called journalism. I hope I like it. Journal=recording=blog=my love. 
<br />
<br />I really hate myself sometimes. Maybe I have a mental disorder. I can't let anyone suspect anything though.
