It seems to me that I have spawned some advocates for this site. How surprising. I mean, this ia a wastebasket of misery, and some kid thinks that it's awesome. He wants mention, and now. But... am I going to give it to him? Is he really worth mention on my wastebasket of misery? Who deserves choice mentions? Well, first of all, all of the people I dislike go into that category. Second of all, people who are my close, close, friends go into that category. Zach Hallberg is... kind of in the middle. Oh, I gave him a name mention, well, can't do anything now. It's already written in stone...

<br />Anyways, everything is collapsing. A cascade of concrete and syrup. Enveloping me and everything I have. I feel like I sink everytime I'm walking. Sinking into the ground. The sky is falling, the ground is melting, and the big boys at the big MS are messing themselves up for the upcoming release of Longhorn. What could make my life any better? Anything really...

<br />What is art? You look at art as a sign of "culture" in a society. I can see the correlation (Not many art museums in Ethiopia, if you know what I mean), but is art the pinnacle of society? I think art signifies that a society has enough spare time to make a completely dysfunctional, inanimate piece of nothing. Art, a painting on a wall. Art, a colorful collage. Art, art, art, art, art... You look at a painting. It's really just pigments on a media, like canvas. The pigments are interpretted by your brain. Your brain gives these specifically sequenced pigments a life. You see a face on a painting, you see objects, symbolism. And in the end, when you make sense of it all, you try to figure out what it means. Most of the time it means nothing, but you find a symbol or a reason for it to exist. Art, the creation of life. Art, the wasteful bigotry of a rich society. Art, an extreme of "cultured" society. Art.

<br />Think about it, man.
