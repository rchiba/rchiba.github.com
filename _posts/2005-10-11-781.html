To tell you the truth, I thought about what would happen if I jumped off the railing of my second floor today.<br /><br />After thinking for about five seconds, I figured that death would be unlikely unless I got the jump and impact perfectly parallel with the ground. Otherwise, I would just break my neck and become paralyzed. Plus, the first floor is carpeted and that would dampen the impact. The height from jump point to impact point isn't that great either. The short distance would cause not such a quick death. So, I figured that it wouldn't be such a great idea. I know there are some books out there all about this. I've read some of them, sort of because I think it's neat. What I mean to say is, I would rather read a book about killing one's self than some symbolistic artsy-fartsy novel. I would rather flip through a medical book with gory pictures of blood and torn flesh than flip through a book of fine French art. It's not like I'm going to follow through with the recommendations in these suicide books. That's like saying that reading a book about serial killers (I think that's neat too) will cause one to become a serial killer. It's just one of those neat taboos with a neat background and history.<br /><br />What I just said above is a good example of what I should write more often.<br /><br />If I had any sense in the world, if I actually took the rational, socially acceptable, "not to freak people out", approach in writing these posts, I probably wouldn't have written the above statement. The reasoning behind this is that the above statement will, as a given, alarm people, and also as a given, cause people to pay attention to me.<br /><br />But, who cares if people are alarmed and people pay attention to me? What really matters is that what I log down isn't censored by the "socially-acceptability filter". If all the real things are filtered out, then the posts aren't accurate. It's like writing a book by only using numbers. <br /><br />I hate trying to limit myself by reminding myself that there are people who actually read the nonsense that I write. But, who's to say that there are limits? <br /><br />People can think what they want, and I'm going to attempt to not care.
