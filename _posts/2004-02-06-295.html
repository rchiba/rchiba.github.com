Average Yo here,
<br />anyways, it is late so I cannot write alot today. I have spent all of today trying to understand some mathcounts concepts. Luckily, I learned some things today. Also, I finished most of my homework so I don't have to do it later. It is late and I am going to have to wake up EARLY tomorow. I better stop soon. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, the mathcounts thing is going to be a bit embarassing for me because I stink at math, but at least I try. I really doubt East Tipp will win, but miracles can happen. Plus, alot of other people are working hard too so I hope we can all do our best. Another thing to do on my agenda is to memorize my speech. It is a bit wordy right now. It'll take some real concentration to really memorize my speech.
<br />
<br />Anyways, with the limited time today, I cannot talk any longer.
<br />Good NIGHT ;)
