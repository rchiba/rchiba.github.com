<span style="font-size:180%;">Top Four Reasons Why I Dislike French Class</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The teacher quickly and ruthlessly isolates those who perform well and those who don't</span>, and makes sure the rest of the class knows your status. For low-performing students (like me), a look of disgust and a quick flick of the wrist are all you get for that 20pt worksheet. For others, she lifts her hand to her mouth and makes bothersome noises to celebrate that person's achievement. Although this was cute for the first week, now it just makes me feel isolated, alone, hopeless, and stupid. <span style="font-style: italic;">I believe she finds great pleasure in causing pain</span> in those who are not as skilled in languages.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. She picks favorites.</span> From how she picks certain students to have conversations with, to who she uses as the "ideal student" example, it is obvious that she has a heavy bias for/against certain people in class. Ass-kissers are often showered with bubbles and confetti (I'm not kidding here.) Personally, I have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">strong resentment</span> against such ass-kissers. How come the teacher didn't "<span style="font-style: italic;">carelessly forget</span>" to find my mistakes on the test? It's because I don't pretend to live in a happy-fun-bogus-"<span style="font-style: italic;">I love my french teacher</span>" world.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. The general anxiety and tenseness of the classroom</span> leaves me with an upset stomach and a pacing heart. Even our seating configuration (three rows on each side of the room, students facing the center) contributes to the negative atmosphere. Sitting in class feels like working in a concentration camp. You could be singled out at any second, your grade executed, your dignity burned, and your soul shot. All the while, she sits at her desks and acts benign. If you ask her a question, she may refuse to answer it, on grounds that it would be too much help. I think her explanation is absurd. You're here to teach damn it, and we're never going to learn if you just stick your head into a hole and call yourself helpful.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. The teacher feels the need to assert her power.</span> This results in frequent harsh (and unjust) disciplinary measures for students who have absentmindedly forgotten to shut up at a given moment, or have forgotten their books, homework, or another material. Such measures are done in front of the entire class. While you're watching the poor student get hammered, you are both relieved, angry, depressed, and hopeful. Relieved because you're not the one about to be killed. Angry because the killing is unwarranted. Depressed because nothing will change until she retires. Hopeful because you didn't sign up for AP French.
