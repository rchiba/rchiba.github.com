I feel like a battered and wind-eroded house. A house stuffed with cheap pink insulation foam and a house with its lead paint starting to chip off and cause cancer. A house that still stands, even after all of the elements have tried to knock it over.<br /><br />I have updated the "book cards" webpage that helps those people out there who think that book cards should not be a time-waster. I mean, if you've read the whole story, why doesn't everyone just use my website for studying instead of some stupid card? I'm hoping it catches on soon. <br /><br />Anyways, Amanda, Josh, and I are planning a mysterious trip to the famed, "Alpaca Shack" in the mall. I have never seen anyone come back out of that store. I know there's some kind of alpaca mafia behind this all. It's all a conspiracy...<br /><br />I acomplished a great feat today, which is trying, and making, a back one and a half, albiet with water-smack-scars. Pain used to be a giant doberman with a black and red chain collar. Now pain is just a little, harmless, and cute puppy. Not really, but when your back is numb, there aren't many pain cells left to pick up the pain that is being inflicted.<br /><br />I wonder of Zach is still reading this... You know, I predict that Zach will become some kind of criminal when he grows up. Some kind of... FASHON CRIMINAL! Jeans with a T-shirt? That is SO last year... *cue the hand motion regularly used with homosexual men*. Just kidding...<br /><br />I'm not gay. Seriously.
