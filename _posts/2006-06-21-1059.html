It's late and I have a million things to do tomorrow.<br /><br />The oddest thing happened a few days ago. I had a dream in which I, and others, spoke entireliy in Japanese. This hasn't happened in years. I figure it is because I talk only Japanese to the people in charge of my volunteer duties, as they are not very fluent in English. It feels weird and exciting to have a new area in the mind unlocked. It's like opening a present of knowledge. It makes one think about what we know and don't know. Everyone has knowledge that is locked and unaccessable. What needs to be done is more unlocking. But, a whole language in a matter of days is astounding to me. I really don't have to think about it that much anymore. But, if I don't keep speaking, then it gets locked again and my Japanese vocabulary significantly decreases. I wish I had the same ability with French. <br /><br />Well, can't type much anymore. My mind is a slosh, and I now do not enjoy going to sleep because I know that I will wake up tomorrow drowsy and uncomfortable. Regret regret regret.
