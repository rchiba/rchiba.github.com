Sometimes I feel like I'm inadequate.<br /><br />From previous posts, it's pretty obvious that I'm a very self-doubting person. I can see how one can derive humor from the irony in this situation, as I'm a very "I don't care about what other people think about me" kind of person on the outside, but on the inside, I'm a "I'm a failure because everyone else is better than me" kind of person. It's silly how I obsess over these things, that don't really have any true value. I want the buck to stop here, but unfortunately it's not. I hate to say it, but I'm hardwired to hate myself, and I'm trying to accept it.<br /><br />In other news, I talked to Alex today, for longer than usual, which gets me +3EXP for social skills. One could say that I'm climbing the social ladder, but I suppose everything to this sort of thing is relative. He's such a hopeless machead, but then again, I'm just plain hopeless. Methinks I need a role model.<br /><br />What else? Well, I'm still in a not-so-very "cool beans" mood about my chemistry. Especially since my results seem to be skewed. Not so fantastic.<br /><br />I laugh like a duck sometimes. Does that make people think I'm weird?<br /><br />Otherwise, I'll just keep living my life. But, alas (Yes, I said alas).<br /><br />Blogger is acting up again and not posting my text, so I'm having to save crap to my hard drive, and I hate doing extra work (well, maybe not always). Blogger will die soon, I think. Within the next... hmm... decade at least. I've got all of my post backed up on multiple floppy disks and hard drives, so complete data loss is very unlikely. Which is good, because losing all of my writings, although they suck, would be very disheartening for me. <br /><br />On a side note, after school, I helped teachers build their own websites. Lots of people thanked me for my itty-bitty contribution, but the the true reward for the whole event was the feeling of accomplishment. I truly felt good about how I helped in my own little way, and it was a fantastic feeling. <br /><br />But, to tell you the truth, right now, as I type this, I can't help feeling hopeless again. The euphoric feeling of accomplishment has worn off, and now I feel worthless. I should have drawn something today. Drawing always makes me feel like I've accomplished something, This is probably true because drawing results in tangible results. The kind of results you can hang on your wall, or ink, or color, or scan, or show off to your friends. Writing stories on NaNoWriMo or helping teachers make websites isn't very tangible to me, so the feeling doesn't last as long. <br /><br />I'm just being greedy and trying to quantify this feeling that isn't even supposed to be quantified. Things like this are supposed to be priceless, but I'm attempting to beg to differ. I'm assigning values to things that do not need or have values.<br /><br />Why am I ranting on like this? Am I trying to make myself feel better by typing more? If that's the case, I'm sorry, and now I feel like I've wasted your time and I'm hopeless. Stop coming here, I feel so guilty for wasting your time.
