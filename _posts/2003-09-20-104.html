It's Saturday and I am bored. No one in this neighborhood is wanting to be friends with me, Plus, Ryan is babysitting. I don't know what to do. The only friend I have is the internet, and of course, Justin, Kyle, and (I hate this part) Shishir. I am very bored. I am so bored, that I can't stop repeating myself. If you are reading this, could you e-mail me at averageyo@mostlysunny.com please? I really need to know who is looking at my site, just out of curiosity. I can't believe I'm saying this, but, I am not enjoying the weekend. Also, I don't wanna go to the gym. I really don't. Look, I'm repeating myself again. How stupid am I? Pretty stupid, I might say so myself. I am not liking this weekend at all...
