Finished by 9PM, and that's something worth celebrating. Things move fast and slow. The plastic fan turns fast, but when I collapsed on the floor in my room, nothing, not even the fan, seemed to move fast. In my room the air is hot and humid. <br /><br />All day, all I've been able to think about is myself. Selfish thoughts. But, I kept them in. I'm glad I kept them in. <br /><br />Because you know what? It's one thing to complain about something. And it's another to change one's self to accomplish something.<br /><br />The situations I put myself in today are difficult to navigate through for me. I have lost three school books in the past couple of days. My inability to keep track of things has cost me money, time, stress. It's cost me minutes of talking to my friends, hours of paying attention in class, and days of mental integrity. The worst part of losing things is the feeling of helplessness. The books are somewhere. They exist in this world, they are a specific distance away from me. If I knew where they were, my problems would end there.<br /><br />But, I don't know. I don't know where they are.<br /><br />I can't reach out and find them. I can't work hard and plead to some higher power and find them. There isn't a thing I can do to solve this problem. And it's a frustrating and irritating thing to be so helpless.<br /><br /><b>Math class.</b><br /><br />Things snowballed. My mind took a gripe and attached it to another one. I miss a question on the homework. I don't know why, but it seemed like a very important event. A very bad event. More gripes started latching on. A big ball of anger, resentment, rage, denial, gloomy depression. "Go away, stop it all", I think to myself, and with the suicidal thoughts the desk gets smaller and I see less and less of what's going on in front of my own eyes.<br /><br /><i>What are you thinking? Stop it.</i><br /><br />Can't. Really can't stop... More and more. These stupid things. They don't go away. And the more you think about them the more they bite back. I keep writing on my paper...<br /><br /><i>"Please calm down. Please calm down. It's all stupid, you are too. Deal with it."</i><br /><br />And it gets worse and worse. I look at the board. The numbers, oh. Numbers can't help me now, they're my enemy. A bad grade here and there becomes a bad grade everywhere. It becomes a giant bad grade that follows me around all day. It pushes me toward the wall. Scream. I want to scream at it. Or tell someone about the giant thing that keeps making me feel unhappy. <br /><br />But, I can't. I don't. I will. I did.<i> Is it wrong for me to?</i><br /><br />To keep it inside is the best thing for everyone. Because it's stupid to say something like that. It wouldn't make any sense to a rational person. How could I put such importance on these insignificant things? Tell me. See, you are rational. You have no answer. There is no answer. <br /><br />I ask myself these questions. I can't answer them. I want these questions to not be asked. I want to cure it all. Be normal again. And it'll take awhile. A few hours, maybe. And I'll be back being zippy.<br /><br />And why? I don't understand.
