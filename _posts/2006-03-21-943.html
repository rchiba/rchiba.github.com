With the assistance of a <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/planet/boocab/">certain website</a>, I have been able to finish all of the vocabulary assignments for the year. Exciting stuff, I have to admit, copying down word after words after word on a sheet of paper. Simple "busy work" that is there for the sole purpose of degrading children. I'm glad there are resources online that combat this scholastic fiend.<br /><br />The day was another day of thinking about going to Africa. I just can't get it out of my mind now. And because of this, I'm afraid that it'll eventually start to get stale in my mind and I will forget it forever. And I don't want to forget it forever, but instead, I want it to stay dormant in my memory until the proper time comes. Having all my idealism burst out now will waste it all. Currently, I have no ability to live up to my thoughts. Perhaps in a decade or two I will, so I must save my idealism, my hopes, my dreams. So they don't all fade away, like many of my ambitions have. And when things burn up too early, potential is lost. <br /><br />On another note, I must say that the future is astounding. This statement may seem out of context at the moment, but it really isn't (well, actually, maybe it is). The Sun is eventually going to burn out. So, what does that mean for the human race? It means that this species must do the impossible, accomplish things that cannot even be thought of to this day, simply to survive.<br /><br />It makes me think of the old animated film, "Titan A.E.". I loved the film at the time. Unfortunately, it was a flop and hardly made a dime in theatres. But, the movie made me think about how the human race's future <em>needs</em> are so interconnected and similar to "impossible" <em>dreams</em> of the future. Giant spacecraft and otherworldly travel are things of fiction now. But, how will we, as a species, survive if they continue to be things of fiction? <br /><br />And, it all oddly ties in with Speech class, in the fact that we learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a> today. At the top of the pyramid lies "Self-Actualization". In order for these fictional elements to become critical tools for survival, this tier must be met. But, no one can reach the top tier without satisfying the lower tiers, physiological needs, safety needs, love/belonging needs, and esteem needs. So, I figure, that until these needs are met for most of the world, the world will never be able to grab hold of the top tier, the most important tier. The tier that must be reached in order for survival to be achieved. <br /><br />Obviously, humans have a long ways to go. And, although the time limit is extremely long, the clock <em>is still ticking</em>.<br /><br />Let's all run the rat race. Maybe some of us will get to the end.
