Apparently regional strife is part of my high school now. Due to a few people displaying various (Mexican, Confederate, Nazi, etc.) flags in or around the school, the showing of flags is banned. Makes sense, after all, what better to get all worked up about than patterns of color? For some reason, we put so much value into these simple rectangles of color. Red, white, and blue we must display up above, while white stars in red stripes against a blue background are taboo? And don't even start about the color green. <i>That's too foreign.</i> People argue and discuss about these "symbols", but <i>who cares</i>? Symbols are symbols, nothing more. So, I figure we should all forget about flags and move on with our lives. Wherever anyone comes from, whatever anyone believes in, we're all the same in the end. Breathing, moving, bleeding human beings. <br /><br />We get worried and anxious about all sorts of meaningless things.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.today.reuters.com/Pictures/galleries/Stories/632935502926093750/Previews/nineeleven11090600.jpg" title="OMG IT's FLAG BEING STEPPED ON!!1" border="0">-Reuters<br /><br />The President proves my point.
