I'm listening on my shortwave to some Oakley, California crackpot "priest" who is warning children on his program, "Family Radio", about the "wrath of god." I am alarmed that this kind of programming is allowed to air, but hey, it's shortwave. Sounds really cultist. Makes me think of Waco.<br /><br />I bought a book about serial killers. I can't wait to read it.
