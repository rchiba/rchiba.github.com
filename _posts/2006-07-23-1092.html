I duct-taped the AM radio antenna to my wall, and now I get solid reception for my favorite jazz station(AM920). This is just another reason to break out the over-priced imitation-alcohol beverages. After these tedious months of listening to classical music on 101.3FM, jazz seems so fresh.<br /><br />It's really late at night. Past midnight. And I'm not tired at all. It's a very stupid-sounding thing to say, but those health textbooks are wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I'm getting along just fine on very few hours of sleep. The future holds great potential for the vast reduction of sleep hours. Until "the future" rolls around, I'll keep sleeping my luxurious 5 hours a night.<br /><br />I want a potted plant in my room, but I don't like the insects that are attracted by the mini-flora. The decision will be made eventually to either give up my fantasies of having a potted plant in my room, or to splurge and go buy a small rubber tree. I used to have a rubber tree in my room in Alabama. When I moved into the house, I the plant was three feet high. Four years later, I had to get rid of it because I was moving. The plant had grown into a true tree. When it didn't fit through the front door, I had to cut it into small pieces. I still remember the streams of rubber that flowed from the dying plant. Such a waste of life. But, if I was given the chance to nurture botanical life again at such a personal level (you must understand, I said 'good night' to this rubber tree every night), I would definitely do it. I'm sure there's a small rubber tree that needs a home somewhere out there. I've just got to find it.
