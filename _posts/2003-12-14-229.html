I am so sorry, bloggy...
<br />I haven't had the time to update you because I have been toying around with my silly palm pilon. It ended up that it is not a piece of cra*, but rather a versatile tool. I have various books on it and various programs on it (dictionaries, games). I am glad my dad didn't throw it away. Anyways, I had so much to do this weekend and didn't get nearly enough done. I really need to study for the english test. Also, I forgot to practice my talent show act, but it's going to be very terrible anyways, so who cares?!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I wonder if palm pilots are ok to bring to school? I checked in the student handbook and it said nothing about palm pilots. It doesn't disrupt class or anything so I guess it is ok. Too bad no one else has a palm pilot. We could beam messages to each other with the infared communicators. Oh well...
<br />
<br />I know that everyone will go bazookers about the little gadget of mine. I hope they don't make a rukus. I just want to be a normal 8th grade geek. Wow, after christmas, I will really look like a geek. A palm pilot, an atomic watch, glasses. Wow, geekyness has never looked so appetiezing. I downloaded a book onto my palm called criminal socialogy. It is one of the only books that I can understand. It has all these british words though. Anyways, I better get to study for my english test and check the message board for the mathcounts thing. I haven't been on the internet for 2 days (a record). Wow, the palm pilot must really be addictive. Well, sorry for not updating, but I have redeemed myself, Right?
