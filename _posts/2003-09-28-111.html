Hello,
<br />I am better now. I went to the zoo yesterday and got a ton of awesome animal shots with my Camedia D-380 digital camera. I love my camera because it is so very awesome. There were tons of animals all over everywhere. It looked like they were getting obese though. I guess they have Americana Fever. Too many humans feeding them, constantly. The giraffes even had fat folds on their necks. They could get a heart attack! Anyways, school is tommorow and I don't know what to do today. Oh yea, I have had some replies to Ryan's advert attack at school. 2 actually. People that I know are looking at my journal, oh well. Like my privacy isn't destroyed anyways, with the "Patriot Act" and all. The CIA is probably spying on me right this very second, as I type. Anyways, I don't know what to talk about, besides going to the zoo and all. Oh yea, I have a comment to those hippies at washington, The stone age didn't end because of the lack of stones, so the oil age won't end because lack of oil, so shut up hippies!
<br />
<br />Ok, I think that is all I have to say.
<br />Intelligence has limits, but stupidity doesn't
<br />TATA;)
