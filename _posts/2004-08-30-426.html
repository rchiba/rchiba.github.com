I went to Devin's birthday bash thing. I didn't know that he would invite me. I mean, come on. I'm not the most popular person in the world, if you know what I mean. Anyways, it was great. It really taught me that all you need for a good, entertaining party is Oliver and sugar. Very good combination.

<br />The mystery mosquitos have been biting me. When I woke up this morning, I was covered in insect bites. They itch terribly.
<br />
<br />On the school side, I am writing a mystery story which I am thinking about right now. I'm pretty sure it is going to be about a museum in France traffiking art for extra funding money. Yea, that's it. Anyways, I should talk more about Devin's party, but I can't because I have to play my clarinet and because Devin might want his partays confidential.

<br />I'm tired and scared and confused. Another post, another day, another corny speech in the auditorium. Have a nice night people of the world!
