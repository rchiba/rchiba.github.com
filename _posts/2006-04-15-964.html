<img src="http://www.telechimp.com/telechimp/nancy%20grace-thumb.jpg" title="Nancy Grace = Bad" border="0"><br /><br />This is Nancy Grace. Frankly, I hate her. I know that "hate" is a very strong word, that is often times too crude to be used tastefully, but that's the only word that comes to mind at the moment. Every so often, I turn on the television while I brush my teeth. Lo' and behold, I always happen to brush my teeth when Nancy Grace is busy ridiculing some poor journalist on national television. <br /><br />She's a lawyer.<br /><br />So, I guess that's what she was born to do. Born to protect "innocent" people, born to "negotiate" (argue), born to cajole a confused jury to agree with her through a presentation of "facts". So, in a sense, she was born to bother me. <br /><br />Every time I happen to catch her show, I try to give her another chance. Another chance to be my friend. She fails every time, because every day, she has this routine that never ceases to infuriate me. It goes something like this:<br /><br /><ol><li>Pick out a controversial topic and/or current news event.</li><br /><li>Choose a side.</li><br /><li>Invite a few uncharismatic journalists and experts to her show.</li><br /><li>Do just barely enough research to understand the event in question.</li><br /><li>Get the rest of the information handed to you by underlings.</li><br /><li>Start the show, introduce the topic being sure to add a touch of personal bias.</li><br /><li>Ask the aforementioned journalists and experts questions.</li><br /><li>Rudely interrupt them in the middle of their answer to ask more questions.</li><br /><li>Accuse them of being corrupt liars.</li><br /><li>Cut the invitee off completely, and continue to tell the story, being sure to add personal bias.</li><br /><li>Introduce a few more guest speakers</li><br /><li>Accuse a few more guest speakers.</li><br /><li>Urge watchers to take action by writing letters to their congressperson.</li><br /><li>End the show with a emotionally-wrenching conclusion that makes the watchers hate the opposing viewpoint.</li><br /><li>Rinse and repeat every 24 hours.</li></ol><br /><br />Frankly, I can't stand people who interrupt people and don't let them talk. Nancy is one of these people. She asks questions for the sole purpose of interrupting other people, and it is very evident that she has an over-inflated ego. My hope for the world is that someday people will take the time to listen to each other and resolve issues peacefully. What <i>Nancy Grace</i> does is militaristic. She fights to get you to agree with her, and she has no regrets grilling some innocent journalist or health expert. Sure, maybe she's right every once in awhile. But, it doesn't matter to me, <b>because if she's not considerate enough to let other people talk, then her own point of view isn't worth hearing.</b><br /><br />I hope she doesn't reproduce. I would hate for the world to be populated with more Nancys.
