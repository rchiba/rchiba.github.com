Today, Justin is going to pick me up at 1:25 to go see a movie! Yay. I am so glad. Too bad winter vacation is over though. Might as well go to school. I have to make sure I practice my speech about my grandma and her life. It is worth 150 points!

<br />My, actually my mom's, leather computer chair came today. I assembled it and I was the first to sit in it. Unfortunately, right when the computer chair comes, the main computer is totally crashed. I am sitting in my chair at this auxillary computer and it is bad. My dad spilled coffee on the keyboard and now it is moldy. There are little splotches of mold between the keys and when I type, my hands get all stiky. Ewww.. Not to mention the stains of some unknown liquid on the monitor. I am surprised this computer hasn't malfunctioned in its now 6 year life span. It has a creaky backspace button that is really anoying. I better wash my hands because they are all moldy and sticky. Ewww...

<br />I gotta do my daily websurfing and wash my hands so bye
<br />BYE;)
