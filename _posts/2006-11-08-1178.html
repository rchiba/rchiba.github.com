I suspect it bothers you too when you walk into your room and find your things in all the wrong places. From that one misplaced cd case, or overturned book, you know that someone has been in your room, looking through your items.<br /><br />And so goes my life. My radio's graphic equalizer was not in the right position, and my locked briefcase had mysteriously turned its numbers to the secret code. Something is wrong in my room. I don't want it disturbed.<br /><br />I've been getting too angry in the past few days. I have to calm myself down and realize that problems are solved through work, not aggravated drivel. For example, I've been getting particularly frustrated in my thoughts toward the Lego League children at Burnett Creek. Some of them are arrogant, some refuse to work, some are loud and stupid, some have no social skills. <br /><br /><i>See!</i> I'm doing it again. It's just that when the kid who signed up for the "research" part of the project is downright refusing to write anything, one gets to wondering why they are part of a robotics team. Or why such a team even exists.
