Wow, it seems like Amanda is having a bad day. 
<br />Average Yo, reporting in.
<br />How is school you say? Fantastic, well not really. Everyone's been complaining and complaining. I just want to pull out a metal bar and shove it in their mouth and out of the back of their head, then slowly twist the bar around eventually twisting their head off. Then I can show the world my anger... then i can... These people complain about the weather, their clothing, the temperature, my website, me, the homework. I WANT THESE D*MN M*RONS TO QUIT THIS SH*T AND GET ON WITH THEIR F*CKING LIVES! What am I going to do after you complain to me. I am not god, and I cannot produce miracles. Go away d*mn it. I am infuriated (as you can tell) by their stupid behavior that makes no sense and DECREASES my valuable productivity. Then THEY say that I have no justification for my anger. I HAVE PLENTLY JUSTIFICATION! Anyways, I think that these people should go complain somewhere else, because I don't care about them. They are nonentities to me. They might as well die.
<br />
<br />Anyways, Shishir and Devin still haven't changed their minds about going to West Lafayette High School. Oh yea, I had a dream about Devin last night. I walked into school to get some books that I forgot in my locker. It was dark (around 6 PM) and I finally got to my locker. I was terrified to find my locker door gone and the inside empty. Staring into my empty locker, I could only desipher a few chipped pieces of metal and a piece of fabric (probably from my backpack). Then I turned around to see Devin and John Perigo. They were dressed up in casual tie suits with loafers. They looked very mafia like. John had a baseball bat. Then Devin put a black blindfold on me. John kept whaking me in the stomach while Devin kicked me. I didn't feel pain, but I was bleeding and I acted as I felt pain. Then my blindfold came off. Me, being bloodied up and Devin and John satisfied, Devin said, "you learned your lesson?". I said, "yea". Then we shook hands and I pretended it never happened. I woke up then. The term to describe that dream was dramatic and movieish.
<br />
<br />Well, my dreams are weird, but I think I learn something from them everytime. This time, I learned to be nice to Devin. Also, the sitemeter sent a email to me today. I got 81 page VIEWS this WEEK! Woohoo. it could be a sign of teachers browsing through my site. ***Looks Around***. Well, I hope they don't bring in my personal life to school. Even though I bring school into my personal life. Anywhoo, it's nine O' clock and I better get back to sleeping. I really need my rest. I have a math test tomorow that I hardly understand. Also, I took a science test today that was pretty confusing. I am going to get a bad grade on it, I just know it. O' atheist God, please smite thee!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to sleep. Good Night to all! ;)
