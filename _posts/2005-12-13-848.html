During the summer, I suscribed to as many spam mailing lists as I could because I was feeling very lonely with my empty Gmail account. And the spam came pouring in by the boatloads. Luckily, it all goes to my spam box.<br /><br />Sometimes, I like to go into my spam box for entertainment. It's never short of messages (3641 messages currently) and never shrinking (about 1 email every 2 minutes, constantly). So, let's jump into Ryo Chiba's spambox and see how I would reply, if I were able to contact the people who send these silly messages.<br /><br /><em>Holiday Black Dating <return@onesweetscope.com>  Wed, Dec 14, 2005 at 11:31 AM  <br />To: ryochiba@gmail.com  <br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />This is an Advertisement - Removal and other important info regarding this ad can be found below<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Are you Black and Single?

I'm sure as hell not black, but I'm single. Does that make me a good candidate for your service? What makes you think I want to be part of the "ultimate Black dating scene"? May I mention that you are being politically incorrect when you talk about "black" singles, and "Black" dating scenes? The word you are looking for is AFRICAN AMERICAN. Get that in your fucking head. They are not "black". Just as I am not "yellow" or Europe is not "white". I don't know if you have monochrome vision or something, but dark skin does not justify your racist language. Go to hell.</strong><br /><br />Let's see. Hmm... This looks interesting.<br /><br /> <em>Awesome Toys <933-27669728-1-13-74903mpxas@blankland.com>  Tue, Dec 13, 2005 at 3:12 PM  <br />To: ryochiba@gmail.com  <br />CONTROL YOUR VERY OWN UFO<br /><br />As it Glides, Hovers and Flies!<br />•           INFRA-RED CONTROL TECHNOLOGY<br />•           UFO SAUCER POWERFUL MOTOR<br />•           DUAL-TRIGGER, 2-CHANNEL RADIO CONTROL<br />•           AC ADAPTOR BATTERY CHARGER<br />•           COMES COMPLETE AND READY TO RUN<br /><br />ENJOY THRILLING FLYING ADVENTURES WITH THIS FLYING SAUCER!

Need to lose an extra 5 to 50lbs-- OR MORE?<br /><br />DID YOU NOW?<br />Obesity is the silent killer responsible for over 300,000 DEATHS each year in the U.S.<br />DID YOU NOW? Severely overweight people have a 12x higher risk of death.<br /><br />DID YOU NOW?<br />No other weight loss supplement is as powerful or effective as Ephedra. Due to the fact that Ephedra was temporarily banned in the U.S. --which was recently overturned by a Federal Court in Utah -- supplies are LIMITED in quantity. To be guaranteed your supply of ECA FUEL, you must order NOW. <br />--Plus, it sends your Energy through the roof !!<br />A breakthrough so effective, so amazing...<br />it was actually banned for being too powerful.<br />Now it’s back... and better than ever!</em><br /><br /><strong><br />To:rfiddlfdglgebhhegljdhjbihfd@beenthols.com<br />From:ryochiba@gmail.com<br /><br />Did I know that obese people die faster? Well, as a matter of fact, my father is in the healthcare profession and knows very well of how fat people die fast. I mean, isn't it obvious that being a giant lard blob is not good for one's health? I mean, clogged arteries means heart failure, and heart failure means death.<br /><br />And so, let's see, why is Ephedra not sold in the US anymore? Well, the FDA banned it because it was causing heart attacks and heart failure in people who were using it.<br /><br />So how is this Ephedra any better than being an lard blob?<br /><br />And why would I want to lose "5 to 50lbs-- OR MORE"? I weigh 110 lbs. If I lost 50 lbs, I would be 60lbs. FOR FUCKS SAKE, THAT'S ABSURD!<br /><br />And is the fact that you call your supplement "ECA FUEL" bother me? The answer to that question is obvious.  </strong><br /><br />And to think, people actually believe these things.
