I cut the lawn today. The weather was very nice. My bland sentences bother me. The blue sky cast an optimistic aura, and I could feel it. Rain is great and all, but bright light can bring such vibrant color. It's hard to see rain as anything more than dark and gloomy after going through a clear-sky day like today. The greens are greener, and everything is bright, maybe too much so. After mowing the lawn, I took my dark sunglasses off and had to shield my eyes from the sunlight so I could protect my vision.<br /><br />It's neat, being able to go to the library any time I want. After mowing the lawn, I muddled around the computer, found out that I lost the animation contest that I spent all of Sunday working to win, brushed off the stray grass dust on my pants in defeat, and climbed in the car to go to the library. I figured out I'm still a novice at this driving thing. I turned on the car before I opened the garage door. Stupid move. I spent the next seven seconds fearing that my dog and I would get carbon monoxide poisoning. I was worried more about my dog than myself. I mean, if my death would be justified through my stupidity, but innocent civilians (yes, I consider my dog an innocent civilian)? Unjustified. Can't let it happen. <br /><br />Luckily, I got the car out of the garage before my paranoia took full grip. <br /><br />On the road, I noticed how nice everybody is. I don't see how people get road rage. People behave predictably, and it's very comforting. But, I know this  mindset is incorrect, even dangerous. Accidents are merely results of human error. I must keep myself from assuming that people will behave as I predict them. But, I can't help but smile and subconsciously thank the drivers of the other vehicles. I even give them little names like "Mr. Jeep" or "Miss Grimy 92' DeVille".<br /><br />At the library, I put on a stern face and quickly rushed to my little chair in the corner of the building. I don't know why I act so antisocial in a place that's not particularly hostile. I always try to look like a homicidal, suicidal, angst-filled teenager, but I don't know why. I guess I don't want people bothering me while I read. I picked up a few graphic design books from the shelves and brought them to my little corner. I always sit in that little corner. It's become a second home to me. It's a great spot because it has a good view (I can see all the way down the main library corridor) and I don't have to worry about people behind me (as it is in a corner). In front of the seat is a desk, a cheap pine desk, but very useful for putting books and other things on top of. <br /><br />So, I sat there reading graphic design books for three hours. I noticed an unshaven, scruffy looking man sitting two seats in front of me, slightly to the right, and I thought to myself, "<i>What a relaxing life it would be to be able to live most of life in a library.</i>" I assumed he was homeless, although my assumptions are commonly wrong. But, I think it would be just wonderful to secretly live in a bookstore. Or, if I could do anything, I would probably rid myself of all mortal needs and inconveniences (hunger, comfort, hygiene, bladder, energy, fun, etc.) and just read forever and ever.<br /><br />Wouldn't that be just swell?
