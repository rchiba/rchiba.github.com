For the past few days, I've lacked a decent sleep schedule. My biological clock has gone haywire from the intense, 13 hour jet lag. I go to sleep at two in the morning and get up at eleven. It's not like me to have such a distorted sleep schedule. So, I'm planning to go to sleep around now tonight. Not like you care or anything, so let me spare you from the monotony of myself ranting on about how I sleep.<br /><br />I check my email more than I check the time. Whenever I find my inbox empty, I find myself disappointed. I always seem to find my silicon relationship with other netizens unrendered. Feelings like this sometimes make a big impact on how I look at the day. You're probably like, "WTF, y iz h3 l1ke s00 3m0?" Well, think about it. I don't get much social interaction. I've stayed in my house for weeks at a time. Email is basically my form of a social life. <br /><br />And to think, my feelings won't matter the next day, or five bajillion years into the future. That's why feelings shouldn't matter now. Outlook on life should be always pleasant, because feelings are primal. In the future, everyone will be drugged up so badly by the government that there will be no feelings. And you know what? It'll be all for the better.
