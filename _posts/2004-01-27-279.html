Yes, I'm back once more in this blog of Ryo's.  I was going to start again at the beginning of February, but there was too much on my mind.  Lately, I've felt like nobody even knows I exist (mostly at school.)  No one ever talks to me.  No one ever invites me or includes me in anything.  Yet, sometimes I find this perfectly to my advantage.  I am able to do the things I want to do and get the things done that I want to get done.  Then again, sometimes I would like for someone to come and talk to me.  This makes me feel like I'm just a ghost that people only see when they are talked to.  The only people at school I can have a conversation with are teachers and other adults.  I have to talk to be noticed.  One thing that's good about the quietness is that I get my homework do and I'm not bothered all the time.  I rarely even get a somple "hi" when I'm walking down the hall.  The last person I remember saying "hi" to me is Ryo.  When I'm eating lunch, nobody wants to talk to ME.  OF COURSE NOT!  WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME!  I don't know!  Tomorrow, if we have school, I'm going to sit with Ryo, practically my only real friend at school, again.  I don't even know why I bothered to move.  That was stupid of me.  Sorry Ryo.  At least you actually talk to me.  I've been reading some of Ryo's previous updates and I'm beginning to agree with him more and more every day.  I'm beginning to feel a sudden urge to take advantage of what's being place right in frint of me.  Well, I've gotta get going now.  I've got homework to finish.

<br />Oh Yeah, I been in need of a good book lately, so if anyone has a request of a good fantasy/adveenture book, that would be great.  You can email me at: JustinWalker123@msn.com
