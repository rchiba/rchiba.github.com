I feel extremely disapointed in myself. I did well in everything, except everyone else did a better job. I feel like I don't even belong in a Rural Public Middle School in the middle of a cornfield. Now how sad is that? I can't even compete anywhere. I am a worthless pile of feces. I think everyone's my friend only because they feel sorry for me. That is even sadder. I am being looked down upon by people. I should crawl into my hole and study. I have nothing fun in my life. Nothing is fun anymore. Everything is the same. Everything is bad. All hope is lost.......................................
