This afternoon, I caught a glimpse of a documentary on "little people". I find it facinating that such deformed humans can continue to live relatively normal lives in this exceedingly hospitable modern world. Just imagine the lives of these people in the 19th century, or even the early 20th century. They would either die early due to technological inability correct bodily malfunctions, or live in a secluded room, far away from other people, to die alone. Either way, life is rather horrible for these people.<br /><br />And this whole episode made me think about how lucky I am to be a healthy, mentally sound, monetarily adventageous human being. So many people I know who have experienced hardship upon hardship throughout their lives. Whether it be abusive parents, or physical injury, or terminal mental anguish, there are so many things that could have gone wrong that haven't. In New Orleans, I was a step away from being killed from a motorcycle. Instead, my head was only slightly lacerated by the cyclist's watch. Mere inches from disaster. In Montgomery, I was in a car crash that could have crushed the other side of the car. A few summers ago, I was standing on a bridge with a friend, trying to fish. After a few minutes, we moved to the other side of the bridge thinking that there would be fish there. An instant later, a car comes swerving down the road and smashes the side of the bridge where we were, moments before, standing. One could even believe that I live in a parallel universe, a perfect universe for myself. In all the other universes, I would either be in poor mental/physical condition, or dead. It's a wonder that I'm still sitting here in my room with all four of my limbs.<br /><br />I hate Thanksgiving. We should be grateful every day.
