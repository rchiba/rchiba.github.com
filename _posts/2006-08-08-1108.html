I didn't know I was so shy. <br /><br />Before today, I figured that I wasn't as shy as I was a few years ago. I've had many, many social events take place over the course of this summer, and last school year as well. I started to relax, get to know people better. Still talking with an occasional stutter, but talking nonetheless. The memories that pop out in my mind are of me and my QuizBowl friends playing cards in a hotel room between my house and Washington DC. I did a few things that I ordinarily wouldn't do. Not stupid things. But, little, subtle things. Talking a little louder, being more dynamic in my expressions, exhibiting a looser body language, being more open to talking about certain topics. My conversations and random outings with Ryan also pop out in my head. I can talk to him and actually not care about what I say and how I say it. <br /><br />I went to register at school today. An annual pilgrimage for all enrolling students. This year's wasn't all that fantastic. The line for registering was long, but the line for getting a parking pass was even longer. By chance, I got parking spot 460. I like even numbers. Perhaps my parking spot is lucky. Don't tell me otherwise, because you'll break my paranormal hopes and dreams.<br /><br />Locker was in the Technology hallway. Not so fantastic locker real estate. I'll be sharing lockers with people most likely. I have the top locker though. So I won't have to crouch to get things anymore. My back will thank me when the school year starts up.<br /><br />But, again, back on topic. I walked into registration and I felt really afraid. My eyes are slowly getting worse, so I'm starting to have trouble making out faces. So, I would glance at people and not be sure if I should save or say hello. When I got within range to recognize faces, I would usually be too afraid to say anything or even wave. Lots of awkward glances. I just stared down at my shoes and kept shuffling forward in the line. Just wanting to get out of the place. Just wanting to escape.<br /><br />After over an hour, the paperwork was finally done. On my way out, I forgot to hold the door open for someone, and so felt bad for a few hours at my house. Just sulking around from room to room, that's what I did for awhile.<br /><br />
