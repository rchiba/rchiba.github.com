Bound to the shackles of the reverse psychology, I am subtly forced to go to the International Sports Center. Vile... Yet, with this reverse psychology, I can't say no. If I say no, I have gone against my civil duty and thus must commit suicide. Actually, I wouldn't take it that far. No, really. Don't look at me like that.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to keep listening to music to keep me from exploding when doing my homework. Whenever I have to do homework, and right after that, go to the gym, I feel like I'll expode and just splatter the contents of my body all of the beige walls of my living room. Organs slowly sliding down the walls, pieces of my clothes drenched in thick cherry red oozing blood, et cetera, et cetera. Anyways, I don't want to explode, so I listen to my jazz and everything is happy until I realize that my little bubble world is nonexistant and that I'm going to eventually have to go to the gym and toil and toil and toil, and that's when I feel like exploding again. ANd again. Have you ever thought of double internal combustion? You blow your body up, and then your limbs are left, right? Then like 5 minutes later, your limbs blow up. It's like a double whammy, RPG style. Sorry, I like to think violent thoughts before I go to the gym because I am so angry that the inevitability of going to the gym is just... inevitable. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I abandoned my current nerd squad to join another nerd squad, and this takes it to a new level. I sat with Karl at his lunch table. Then a bunch of older nerds came. They seemed nice. They were all talking about the D&D club. It was very facinating. I talked to Karl about D&D club and he said it was fun, but you had to know the rules. I'm not much of a rules kind of guy (I'm contradicting myself again). 
<br />
<br />Now that I think about going to the gym again, I'm so furious. FURIOUS!!! I don't konw why! Just don't want to go there. Help, I must calm down.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have many tests tomorow and... Ok, let's not talk about tomorow, or 1 hour from now. I must focus on what happened in the past.
<br />
<br />Focus... focus...
<br />Anyways, I went to stuff and ddids tuff. Ok, I'm not making any sense. I'll stype typeing befur I nead a stteerees bal.dfgsren
