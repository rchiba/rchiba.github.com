Sob story time, with Ryo Chiba!<br /><br />I take my French test, and I finish five minutes after everyone else. The teacher always gives me this quirky smile before each test. I always shoot back a grimace of confidence. And, always, I fail to match my confident presentation to the teacher. I'm always the last one to finish any test, and I don't get good marks on these things either. <br /><br />So, I finish the test, but I let it sit at my desk. I mull over a question that I'm not sure on. Mull over it for quite some time. Mull over it for enough time to frustrate me. I begin to believe that my entire test hinges on this one question. The answer I wrote down in the blank is a mere guess, but if it's right, it's going to be a good day. If I'm wrong, then I'm a loser, a failure, a shame of the human race.<br /><br />The question stares back at me like an angry dog. It hates me. The question wants to be answered, but it isn't being fulfilled, and I can sense that. I stare back at it, thinking that somehow, my idiotic hostile behavior is justified by my low French scores.<br /><br />The teacher collects the test, and I walk out of class, nervous. Not confident at all.<br /><br />I find out the question is wrong. And I engage "Oh, woe is me" mode. For the whole day, I'm in "woe is me" mode, spreading my ill-feelings to those around me. <br /><br />At the time, I knew that it was pointless to "cry over spilled milk", so to speak, but I did anyways, because sometimes negative sensations cause people to do stupid things. Thinking back, I find it even more despicable that I sink to that level. <br /><br />To think, I sicken myself, but sickening myself just makes me feel sicker.<br /><br />Why in the hell are you reading this? This is nonsensical, worthless text. It lacks any satisfactory content whatsoever. Bah!
