Finals are coming up, an all-day Quizbowl tournament is tomorrow, and my English teacher has assigned me a project.<br /><br />Work, work, work, die.<br /><br />We all work until we die. Just like machines. We'll stand together and turn in papers, learn new things, turn in papers, write essays, take tests, learn new things, work, then die. What is it to die? To stop living physically, to stop living mentally, or just giving up?<br /><br />In QuizBowl, someone was listing what everyone was good at. She said something like, "Zach's good with music, Tif's good with spelling, Jon is good with math, Andrew's good with history, and Ryo is good at...". Then, there was a long, awkward pause. <br /><br />And that's when I truly knew that I didn't belong. I'm not good at anything. <br /><br />Whenever I go to practice, I'm troubled by how little I know, how little I help the team, how useless, stupid, and inferior I feel, how I could be doing something better with myself, how I'm not meant to be part of this team, how it's pointless to even try, how I still wear the team shirt that I don't deserve to wear, and how "average" I am. I'm just another uneducated, crude, unrefined peasant. What am I doing schmoozing with the elite? <br /><br />Every time I get home from these practices or meets or competitions or social gatherings, I feel like killing myself with the antifreeze in my garage, or destroying my room with the various blunt, metal objects in my house, or hiding under my bed and stabbing myself with sissors until my carpet is wet and stained crimson. Of course, I would never have the courage to do these things, but it still tears my mind up practically every day after school. I get this really dense feeling in my chest, like something's not right. And I can't do anything to calm down because there isn't any time to do so. I have to work on this and that, projects and studying, fixing random things that break around the house, mowing the lawn every other goddamn day. And I feel even worse because I'm sure my life is absolutely fantastic compared to other people's troubled lives, and I'm sure that my tirades are unjustified, self-centered rants. I'm sure that people would be happy to trade lives. <br /><br />But, I can't help but feel the dark weight failure tug my head deeper into the muck that's slowly asphyxiating me. <br /><br />I listened to a debate in my speech class about legalized euthanasia for terminally ill people. One of the negative side's arguments was, "Letting yourself die for the sake of alleviating your pain is like giving up. In our lives, we don't aim to give up. In this way, euthanasia destroys the sanctity of life."<br /><br />I gained valuable insight from this argument. Perhaps I'll <strike>reschedule my suicide and</strike> wade through my unstable emotions if only for tomorrow, and maybe the day after that. It's a day-to-day struggle against myself. <br /><br />I should accept that I'll always be the loser.
