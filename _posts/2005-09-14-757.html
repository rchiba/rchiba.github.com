I believe in destiny. <br /><br />If this conflicts with your beliefs, please be open minded. Otherwise, it is completely acceptable for you to read the following and curse at it. All I ask you is, please do not don the pointy white mask and traditional white garb of a certain organization and burn a certain religious symbol in my front lawn.<br /><br />I believe in destiny because true, free choice is nonexistant. Thoughts are just controlled electrical impulses in the brain, cells reacting to stimuli and visual, tactile, and sensory input. <br /><br />Just as molecules, atoms, the very structure of all matter in existance, do not choose which direction they move, or when they react with other molecules, we cannot make our own choices. As I sit here right now, I was destined to type this word, ever since the beginning of time and space. The elements and masses or energy during the Big Bang did not make choices, we today are just a complex myriad of variables. Each variable able to be calculated, outputs predicted. The information around is so complicated that our minds cannot understand. Ideas are just a large mass of charges and electrical pulses, arrangements of atoms and molecules, coming together to what we call the spirit, mind, and soul. One creates religion to try to explain the mathematical algorithms that govern our world. One tries to understand by creating stories of figureheads, creating teachings and rules, trying desperately to grasp existance and understand the truth to all of the perceived madness. Tearing one's self from explainations of the Bible, taught during the first years of a child's life, is nearly impossible. The written words become stories. Stories become teachings. Teachings become the truth. Truth becomes a way of life, a belief. And so, the world keeps turning, and we keep pointlessly trying to convert heathens before the world "ends". I ask you this. Why does our existance matter so much? Why would a higher being favor us, and come down to our lowly planet to judge each human on the end of our existance? There is surely other life in this vast universe. Why us? Well, that must be because we are superior? Well, of course not. It's because we wrote the rules. We, as humans, wrote the stories, started the rituals, created philosophies. How can these words be considered truth? Well, it's all in the magic of the faith, or as they say.<br /><br />Now, I'm sure you've got plenty of counterances for my worthless notions on "fate" and "destiny", but what's the point? Things like religion and destiny cannot be "proven". They are based on nothing, yet everything. The basis for all of these faiths are belief. How can you convince a person who clings to religion as an explaination like a sloth, clinging to a tree branch? Convince, convert, it's all the same. But, belief is belief.<br /><br />You decide.<br /><br />Just my two cents.
