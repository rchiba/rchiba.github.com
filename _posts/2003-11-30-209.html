I'm such a lazy bum.
<br />The last time I updated was Friday, and now it is Sunday. I feel guilty. Oh well, I made a new and long opinion so check it out. It is long, and I am not kidding. Anyways, nothing much has happened besides that I got a wicked hat from gap. You know, the kind with floppy ears, lots of fur. Oh forget it.... 
<br />
<br />Anyways, yesterday, my mom and sister and I (Sorry for the sencence errors) went to "Santa" and took pictures. I spent 3 hours editing and perfecting them and then we go to CVS Pharmacy to get them printed. Then the machine decides to cut off about 2cm on each side of each photo. Then we go home and all my work was DELETED. I feel worthless....

<br />I can't think of anything worthy of writing at this time, so feel free to contribute by sending an email to me;)
