Ok, check out the new joke/misc. info bar at the top of the page, it is funky monkey and tubular at the same time.
<br />Anyways, today is boooring. I think I want to come to school. lol. Guess what, I carved my pumpkin. Pretty Ironic isnt it? I just remembered something extremely stupid I did yesterday at the speech meet. I forgot the Sports and Weather. I am sooo stupid aren't I. I plan to put 8 candles in my pumpkin, so it is extremely bright. 
<br />          I have a plan to put up a full fledged message board, but I need at least 30 people to email me at averageyo@mostlysunny.com so I have the confermation that there are people who are willing to come here and be part of the community. If it goes on, it will be big. I'll have homework help areas, popular people areas, and for those creative types, I'll have various story contests that I publish and sponsor. That is, if 30 People email me. I already have big plans, but I need the people for them to come true. So please E-Mail me if you are reading this. Please...
<br />         So, anyways, I will be updating that joke of the day thing everyday, so keep coming back for my best and most comical jokes! Oh yea, if your iching to start posting on the BBS, try out my mini-bulitin board system on the right hand side of this page. Just enter your name (fake or not), possibly your email (you dont have to), and anything you want to say. Well, that's all ;)
