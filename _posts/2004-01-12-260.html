I have not been updating because of my moronic addiction to Aces High (there's a link on my page if you want to download it). I should have updated, I should have. I didn't do my worthwhile share of studying this weekend. I shall suffer because of it. I studied, just not to the extent of my own self-happiness. My satisfaction of myself has diminished. Now the minuites are ticking away untill the bus comes.
<br />
<br />I bet school will be very amusing and I will have more to write about. At school, there are more variables inputted into the big mix. Today, I hope they don't make fun of the islamic kid, or else I'll go ranting like a psycho again. These "ranting sprees" usually happen in the afternoon, after some little kid makes fun of me. When those small kids make fun of me, I get very angry, but it is to my advantage. This is because I can devise what to do when they make fun of me. The next time they laugh at me, I laugh back and curse their intelligence happily. Then smile and then go away. That is the most satisfying feeling, when you surprise the enemy so much, they don't understand.
<br />
<br />I talked to my friend Kiran (lives in alabama) on the Internet. He made me feel really dumb, but I guess he's always going to have more brain capacity than me. He got All A+'s and his lowest grade was a 98%. He says it's too easy. To top it all off, he goes to a private school. It seems at school, people are smarter than me and back in Alabama, people are smarter than me. I guess you can't be top of the line all the time. But still, I feel like a failure. I failed. I guess this justifies when I get angry about when people call me smart. I guess all my rants are justified. I guess saying, "I guess" means that I am nervous.
<br />
<br />School starts in less than one hour. I have to go soon. So, what's to talk about. A blog is like a tool for someone who talks to themselves. Today, I will try to talk less. I always feel like a fool when I talk. It's one of my worse points. I still haven't written that speech, to my dismay. If my Communications teacher looked at this, I bet she could find millions of gramatical errors. I'm thinking of changing the color scheme, but I forgot what numbers to change in the huge jumble of code. I guess I'll have to guess and check later today. I bet I will have alot of homework today. If I don't, I will probably play Aces High. I don't know why I play Aces High so much. I'm a really bad pilot. Anyways, It's officially 2 minuites before I leave, so I should start all that concluding junk before the bus comes.
<br />
<br />In conclusion, I would like to say that when I get home from school today, I hope I will have something more interesting to talk about. I hope a little kid makes fun of me so I can laugh at him. I hope I start ranting on the bus to protect that islamic kid's rights. I hope I can disprove everyone at my lunch table. I hope...
