Average Yo reporting.
<br />
<br />Anyways, we have this thing at my school called candy grams. I think it is very degrading to all those who do not recieve them. Only in the social higherarchie of the popular people do people recieve such candies. Personally, I hate candy, but it still is degrading if year after year, the same people get 3 to 5 candies while everyone else is sitting there, sad and despondant. If this candy gram is supposed to do anything, I think it was organized to help the social higherarchie of the popular people, show the power and happiness of the social higherarchie of popular people, and to raise money for the student council (which is run by the social higherarchie of popular people). Now, I don't know about you, but I would just like to say that this activity is not sanctioned morally or ethically in the name of the human race. It turns regular happiness into demoralized lumps of coal.

<br />Anyways, I also have to talk about this bone/calcium video in FACS. It had all this stuff about milk and how it was the ONLY thing with calcium in it. It was pretty much stagnant with propaganda. Anyways, as I sit here with no life, spirit, emotion, happiness, friends, or wisdom, I shall keep writing.

<br />Anyways, I have to go the gym tomorow and it makes me angry and sad that no one cares and that ...ugh...no comment...
<br />I'm having a bad day.
