I just came back from my friends house and boy, am I tired. I might have to take a nap soon. Anyways, I had sooooo much fun at his house. We went tubing, watched a drive in movie and went boating. It was great. I had an awesome time and it was better than I expected. The tubing really wore us out because it is mostly about endurance. Anyways, I am tired, so I cant type more.
<br />Bye;)
