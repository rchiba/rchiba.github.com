Today, today, today...
<br />Today, I have hardly any time to type. I went to the gym right after school and then I did my homework. Also, I am talking to justin right now which is really weird. This is going to take some time...
<br />ok, anyways, I sto.. wait borrowed my sisters notebook to record my thoghts onto. I am going to write them here for your enjoyment...
<br />here I GO!!!...
<br />----------------------------------------------------
<br />Today is a cold day as I sit here at the bus stop. Then, I imagine a world... A world so utterly perfect and serene. And then i look up and I see that I am there. As I stand, a mere child opens her pink mouth and screams with an artificial cois and says"BUS!" over and over again. There is no stopping this child. As the seconds pass, this child's decibel level grows to an unbearable level. Then I step into the yellow bullet that is "the bus"...
<br />
<br />Then I take off my hood. I observe all of those classmates (Alpha) doing their homework. Then I think to my self, "INCOMPETENT FOOLS! They should do their homework at home!", but allthewhile, I am silent. Who knows what they will say to me for I am not in ALpha. The bus heater is humming in front of me, gradually warning the are around me. Slowly incinerating me painfully, hotter and hotter. Now Ryan is sitting near me. We talk anout his new invention, s substance reminicant of silly putty. Very interesting...
<br />Here is the recipie...
<br />Ingredients
<br />-1 quart distilled water
<br />-4 ounces of glue
<br />-a tablespoon of borax
<br />Then mix and drizzle glue over mixture...
<br />They Ryan suggests a website called "www.wheresgeorge.com"

<br />^^^^<<end>>^^^^
<br />Ok, anyways, I have about 3 pages more that I wrote, but I don't have the time to type it out so I decided to leave it out. Ok, I hope all goes well tomorow. 
<br />                       Oh yea, one more thing to mention. ***ALPHALEXI*** was acting most insulting today in Social Studies. She was so uncontrolable, she actually wrote "sex" on the board. Right in front of the teacher and LAUGHED. How incompetent. I can't believe she is in advanced, advanced math. How could such a disobedient person be in a class like that. I would just like to say, FOOL! Well, that's my opinion on her. I think there needs to be a forceful diciplinary measure for her. But then again, she would cuss at the teacher at the bus, get her parents biting at the schools heels, and complaining to Alpha group, therefore resulting in exclusion of teacher. How I hate when this kind of power crosses such a unburdened mind! FOOL!
