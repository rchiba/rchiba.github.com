I'm doing some late night chemistry. <br /><br />And no, that is not innuendo. I am working on a large chemistry worksheet packet. It's very difficult. The questions aren't difficult, it's just that I'm very tired, distracted, and cold.<br /><br />This evening, I went to the local bookstore chain with a friend to unwind after my intense chemistry session. So I'm talking to him, and he talks about how he's a "trekkie" and how he fits into this niche in the trekkie world. <br /><br />And it clicks in my mind.<br /><br />At that split second, I suddenly relate to him. I realize that the Trekkie subculture and the Furry subculture are meticulously interconnected. Although the "genres" of the subcultures, the public view on these subcultures, and outward appearance of these subcultures is so inherently different, they are so closely connected. The first Furry cons started out as a subculture within the already bustling and popular sci-fi subculture. At these giant sci-fi cons, there would be a budding furrycon. And so there the fire of fandom kindled until the two subcultures split. <br /><br />And so, at that moment, there was sort of a very comforting feeling around me because I knew that there were others. <br /><br />And I thought that was extraordinary.
