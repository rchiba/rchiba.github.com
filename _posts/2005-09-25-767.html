I spent my time contemplating the Holocaust of WWII.<br /><br />You know, it's facinating how humans find ways to do horrid things to other humans. Where did this killing come from? How would it help anyone survive? Now, it is seemingly illogical and irrational to kill hundreds of thousands of people because of religion, but, did it make sense to the people who took part in this massecre? It doesn't make any sense that anyone would find rationale in these carefully planned out killings. But, perhaps, in the twisted and fearful lives of those under command of a higher power tried to find sense, they found solace in their delusional hearts and minds.<br /><br />I think it's also facinating how something like a graphic novel or any novel for that matter, can evoke such strong emotions. I read the rest of "Maus" today, and it's thought provoking. The content's subject is firm, yet the tone is delicate enough to convey true feelings. How the mind turns raw visual data into emotions and thoughts is beyond my scope of knowledge. I mean, if you think about it, all literature is just a series of recognizable patterns. The patterns representing objects or abstract things, like thoughts. They all come together to form a cohesive mesh. A mesh that can hold things like emotions and thoughts, messages. And to think, what if an alphabet was never invented? What if writing was never developed? The integrity of society, as an intellectual body, would not exist. <br /><br />I suppose that's why these days communication is the key. There are classes on communicating, websites dedicated to communication, companies stringing wires and shooting radio waves around the Earth, all in the name of communication. There is money to be made, prices to be paid, and jobs to be worked, because without communication, what is a human? We're all a very social bunch of animals. To talk is an instinctive thing. Even the most shy person must find ways to communicate to others. It's everywhere. Life is just one big network. Snip one wire, cut off one server, activate one conflicting protocol, and it falls apart. <br /><br />But, as I read my graphic novel this afternoon, I felt like I had connected with the author. And so, I know inside that there is a life to live, and a network to expand.
