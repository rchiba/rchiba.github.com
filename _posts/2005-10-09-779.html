<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3367/196/1600/Tp.jpg"><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3367/196/400/Tp.jpg" border="0" /></a> It says something about a society, a culture, a way of life, a country, when people do things that lack all logic.<br /><br />When people inflict malice upon others.<br /><br />A garbagecan full of perfectly fine toilet paper, the expensive kind even, was wasted last night. And where did this paper and up? In my yard, that's where.<br /><br />It just doesn't make sense that people are dying of starvation all over the world and here I am, picking up toilet paper that has ended up wadded in a tree in my yard. How can one accept this kind of wastefulness? <br /><br />By being a stupid american teenager.<br /><br />That's how.
