I was sketching something out on a sketch pad, which was pretty amazing. <br /><br />Before, I've only used itty-bitty note pads to showcase my doodles. I found a sketchpad under my desk and I just started scrawling on it. Who knows how it got there. So I get a nice reference picture and kick back. Put the laptop in fullscreen browser mode (f8) and start hacking away with my mechanical pencil that I stole from my sister ages ago. After awhile, the sketch starts looking nice(by my crappy art standards) and I start to ink. Big mistake. Art paper sucks, in that it doesn't like gel pens. The ink just won't be absorbed by the paper. Too bad I didn't notice that until I get to the end of the picture and notice my hand covered in ink smears. The actual sketch isn't really that damaged, but I have learned a valuable lesson today. My sketchpad doesn't like ink, or my prized G2's. My note pad just drinks it all up with pizazz, but no... the expensive art paper just spits it back out at me like some rich yuppie in a Cadillac. Some yuppie that likes to golf, drink cocktails, and has a waterfall bar. It doesn't help that the yuppie has some corporate job and a taste for caviar. And not just any caviar. Beluga caviar. Stupid yuppie. I'm just going to have to settle for notepads. They love my G2's.
