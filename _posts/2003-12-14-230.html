Down. Down. Down. My life is spiraling down. Next time i see him, i will kill him. He's taken not only everything from me, but my sister as well. He pays and he dies. I see him once more, never again. he will die and go to hell. I hate him more than anything. he alone recieves my hatred. May he rot in hell and be subjected to a thousand torments.
