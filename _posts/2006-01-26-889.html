My new initiative to be more positive has been attempted today.<br /><br />With what strength I could muster, I was positive for a total of thirty minutes in Chemistry today. And was it an experience. The sensation of being happy after being assigned more work was exhilarating. The paper that once cued disappointment now cued joy. Although my grades were sub-par, I saw the world as still being very much the same. Things were dandy, my mind was clear, life was happy, and Andrew smiled at me.<br /><br />And I smiled back.<br /><br />Wonderful. Marvelous. But, the rush was soon to end.<br /><br />School ends with a bang. But, more like a gripping, striking, monotone, synthetic noise. I walk down the stairs to get my things, go to the QuizBowl meeting room, and am ignored. This doesn't really bother me until I'm about fifteen minutes into the bus ride to some faceless, faraway high school. My peers ignore me, so I decide to ignore myself. I go into stand-by mode and fall asleep. An hour, a banana, and some miles later, I'm awakened by someone shaking my shoulder. I get off the bus.<br /><br />At this point, I'm fuming from who knows what. Really, my anger had no reason at all to exist. So there I am, fuming, drowzy, frustrated, and glum, walking down some hallway in a godforsaken school in the middle of a cornfield to play some silly game involving trivia and buzzers. Who the hell am I?<br /><br />The whole incident seems like a dream to me right now. And to think, the world moves on as I ponder how to elongate my positivism.<br /><br />Maybe I'll aim for 45 minutes tomorrow.
