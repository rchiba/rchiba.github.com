I'm back from summer gym. 
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />I ran 10 laps which is the equivalent of 2.5 miles, in 30 minutes. I am slowly gaining stamina, w00t! The blog's birthday is in 2 days. Wow, I've been doing this for a year! Sad isn't it?
<br />
<br />Well, talking about sad, on to the topic of abortion. Not really. Got ya' there! When you talk to people about abortion or evolution, they usually have no understanding of it, thus making it harder for you to convince them to agree with you.
