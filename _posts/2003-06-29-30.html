A recap of today... Today, I mostly lounged around vegging out and playing runescape. Also, I went to Best Buy and got a raincheck for SSX Tricky, because it was 10 bucks! It sucks that they dont have it though. Anyways, I went to the gym with my dad and we worked up a sweat. I also saw Ben there. He is my 6th grade buddy. My dad also signed me up for a 1 month membership with the gym. School is fast approaching and I havent experienced summer yet. This stinks for me. Oh well... seeya tomorrow folks!
