I'm reading a dastardly mature "adult", yet "furry" comic right now. I'm taking a liking for it, but not for the sexually explicit content. No siree... No, seriously. I suppose you can call it "deep", but it's really not that. I just like the way furries are used to portray the dark side of the world. Or maybe I like the comic because of the gore. Hmm... Hard decision.<br /><br />Warning, this link is not persay, "work safe" or "parents are behind you in the computer room safe", so if you're going to click the link, do it with caution.<br /><br />www.pholph.com<br /><br />And, as a side note, I am not a pervert or a nerd, but maybe I'm a furry fan. And yes, I've read all 704 strips at a cost of about 5 hours. <br /><br />Another side note, I draw like crap, if craps (What is the plural of crap?) were equipped with limbs with opposable thumbs and these craps had easy access to mechanical pencils and cheap notepads from a warehouse.
