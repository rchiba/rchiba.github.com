This is going to be a chaos-bringing, insane, workworkworkwork week.
<br />
<br />Thus, updation is going to be harder.
<br />
<br />I am going to go to a diving meet tomorow. Very scared. Kind of depressed. I can't sleep. I have to go. no time to write. So hard. Each week so much harder. I don't know how I can keep going...
<br />
<br />I'm fading away.
