My physics teacher does "life challenges", and I think they're neat. I don't care much for the extra credit as much as I do about what new topic he'll cover each week. Today, he said that for the next week we have to figure out ten things we're grateful for. It'll be easy, I'm grateful for a lot of things, some more than others. I'm curious to see what would happen if I seached my blog for "grateful". Hmm...<br/><br/>But besides that, I went to Buffalo Wild Wings with all the QuizBowl people. It was a nice gathering, and Andrew and I got to talk some. <br/><br/>What was most striking to me about the whole trip was that I was driving three younger kids home. As I weaved through the dashed lines that crissed and crossed the midnight pavement, a wave of emotion came over me. <br/><br/><i>I'm old.<br/></i><br/>Instead of mooching rides off of other people, now I'm giving rides to those who need them. And I felt proud and a little fearful. For what if I crashed? It's a responsibility not to be taken lightly. Proud because finally I was able to serve others for the better. I felt exclusive, experienced, important. Those three younger friends of mine depended on me to get home. And I was directly related to their ability to get home. And to think, someone depending on me? <br/><br/>It's a change.Â
