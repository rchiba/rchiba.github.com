I'm hitting the ground running.<br /><br />Just came back from a week long vacation.<br /><br />Also have just received word that I will be driving a team or Robotics people around town tomorrow to ask businesses to donate money.<br /><br />To me, this is sudden.<br /><br />But, to the system, it was planned.<br /><br />The 1747 Robotics Team has always felt like a freestyle thing. You get a call the day before the assignment. It's a rush. <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /><br /></span></span>I don't know if I love it or hate it. I just do it. Can't think about it. Like diving. I just had to do it. And I don't know how I'll feel at the end, if I'll regret it or feel proud of what I did. I imagine that a lot of people in the world feel the same things I'm feeling.<br /><br />Sleep. Now that's something that you don't plan. But, it's not at all a free-form sort of thing either. <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span><br /></span></span>
