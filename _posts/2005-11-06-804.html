<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3367/196/1600/socialist.png"><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 421px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 257px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" height="257" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3367/196/400/socialist.png" width="465" border="0" /></a> My accomplishment of the day is being listed on a high-profile website. Today, more accurately, yesterday, a picture of my secondlife self was shown on secondlife.com.<br /><br />If you look at the picture shown above, you'll see a wolf holding a gun, with a pirate hat on in front of a communist flag. That wolf is indeed me. I was checking out the socialist headquarters, and I snapped some pictures of myself in front of the flag.<br /><br />The administrators probably thought that was quite cute, so I got shown on the frontpage of their site. How wonderful.<br /><br />And guess what. While exploring the Socialist HQ, I happened to run into the chairman of the commies. "Lenin Camus", the chairman of the Second Life Socialist Party (SLSP), decided to give me an exclusive office and a title. Now I'm Comrade Forcet. I'm scheduled to attend a political discussion on Wednesday.<br /><br />Political power in cyberspace? I think, yes!
