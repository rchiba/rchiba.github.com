I suck at diving, but I want to learn more. I'm still ages behind Ryan's awesomeness, and I am probably the worst person at diving, and I also stump the coaches with my illegitimate dives, but I want to do more. Call me the pessimistic optimist, but that's what I feel like. I feel like I hate diving because I suck so much, but I really want to do better. It pushes me farther because I hate myself so much. Odd...
<br />
<br />I don't have enough time for anything. I'm forcing myself to try to be in bed by 8:30, but that crunches my free time to practically nothing. I bet tomorow that my english teacher will get angry at me because my printer is broken and I can't print. I find it so frustrating that I am penilized for not doing something that is impossible.
