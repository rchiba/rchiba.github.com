It's amazing that I only watch televison while brushing my teeth. If everyone was like that, dentists would be terrorizing congress like lawyers always are.<br /><br />My new diet would be a big hit. It's called the mouthwash diet. You wash your mouth in that nasty antiseptic stuff for about 5 minutes and then spit out and rinse. It's that easy. Because you wouldn't be able to taste anything for the next week or so, eating wouldn't be such a pleasure. You don't even have to discipline yourself or anything. Also, this method has no permanent effects. I've done it before and it works. Having everything taste like minty alcohol isn't my defenition of a great culinary experience. <br /><br />I've figured that I'm going to learn how to drive this summer instead of take economics. It's a bit discouraging when your own guidence counselor calls one of the standardized classes "pointless." Don't you think?<br /><br />I'm addicted to Marrakesh Express. Please someone get me away from that song.
