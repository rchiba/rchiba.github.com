Hello, Sorry everyone for not updating yesterday, I am feeling overwhelmed by everything coming up. I am going to come back from a vacation from the lakes in ozark the day before the 1st day of school. I hope the transition is smooth, but there is a chance it could get rocky. I went to get my school supplies yesterday at wal-mart. I still need a few things and I hope I can get them soon. If people dont go to get supplies soon, people will only be able to get the reject products. Wal-mart is, after all, pretty cheap. So go fast or get rejects! I saw a person at Wal-Mart from school. It was unfortunately, Molly Menard. She made a big deal and complemented my tallness. She also dyed her hair and when I asked her about it, she said she went to FLorida. I dont think that answer makes any sense. If I recruit enough friends, this site will have daily updates, so DONT WORRY. My blog WILL live on. At least, I hope so.
<br />Bye Bye -RYO
