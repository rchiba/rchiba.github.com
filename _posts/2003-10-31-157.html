Wow, I just got back from Trick-or Treating.... how...fun? ^_^; a heh. My feet are sooo sore. But I guess it was pretty much a lot of fun. My little sis (or soon to be little sis) complained a bit, but we still had fun. Our costumes were the most original, I don't know how many scream people I saw -__-
<br />Anyway, we received plenty of candy (which I will NOT eat all at once, lol) ANd I found out something knew.... Justin WALKER is the Justin on here! HIIIIII JUSTIN!!!!
<br />O.k.... so that was stupid and random and it makes me feel like a jerk.
<br />I am so sorry Justin! Forgive me!
<br />O.k., now that I have begged for forgiveness, I'd just like to say.... I feel stupid, and yes, that has outlasted its meaning. Lol.
<br />Let's see, funny story.....um... I was scared of knocking on doors. I am a chikin! 
<br />O.k., enough of that. I must say I feel honored to be on this team... and...and.. I will try and update at LEAST once a week.
<br />Um, yes, um... by blog-thing? My sister awaits!
