There's nothing I can do about it.<br /><br />I have a terrible cold.<br /><br />Thus, I took some medicine, and now I'm in a drug-induced stupor.<br /><br />This sort of feeling is the kind of feeling that makes everything around you seem like a dream. I can't feel my face. When I run my fingers through my hair, the hair doesn't feel like it's mine. I wash my hands, but it feels like there's no water, and I'm just going through the motions on instinct. And when I walk, I float. <br /><br />My homework is to read a section in a book I have. I don't think I'll be able to do it because the words on the page don't make any sense to me right now. <br /><br />I don't see how I'll survive tomorrow's QuizBowl tournament.<br /><br />Say farewell to this screwed guy.
