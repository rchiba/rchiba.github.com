<i>As I type this, I know I am biased in my telling of this story. How could these blasphemous words be true? <br />Well, this is an anger post. <b>These are my skewed views of reality</b>. Take nothing as fact. Although, I may see it as such.</i><br /><br /><img src="http://img373.imageshack.us/img373/2079/mrstevensonnr5.png" title="Mr. Stevenson" width="400" border="1" hspace="1" vspace="1"><br /><br />He looks at me. Almost as if I am expected to obey his every command. To him, I am the ultimate subordinate. I park my bike and enter the pool area trying not to make eye contact with Mr. Stevenson. Here is some background information. Mr. Stevenson is the father of Stacy Stevenson, another pool attendant who is a year younger than I am. Mr. Stevenson occasionally volunteers to do things at the pool. However, today he is in the hot tub with other Stevensons. Them being his two daughters and his wife. I get to my chair and look up again to survey the pool. My eye catches Mr. Stevensons eye. He smiles. It's not a friendly smile. It is a smile the man flashes to show the world how much happier he is than everyone else. I did not know any of this, did now know his intentions, did not know his thoughts. Did not know the future, the simple association and relationship we happen to have in this chaotic and giant world.<br /><br />The weather is spectacular, although that adjective may be a little overly enthusiastic. I think I'll add an adverb and call the weather moderately spectacular. The clouds fluff overhead, the air is warm, the two pools are clean, and my shift is about to begin. The clock strikes two, and Stacy Stevenson is officially off the hook for being pool attendant. From her position inside the hot tub, it seems that she hasn't been working hard. This is to be expected though, attending pools isn't a very demanding job. Watching the pool, cleaning the pool, collecting money for the pool. Pool, pool, pool, yada, yada, yada.<br /><br />Seeing that the baby pool is a little low, I open the cover to the valve that controls the flow of water into the baby pool. I turn the lever, put the cover back on, go to the pump room, turn the water input on, and I sit back in my chair. MInutes pass as I watch the people in the pool swim, as I watch the Stevensons chat away in the hot tub. No one can see where I look because I am wearing mirrored sunglasses. The children play their little games in the pool, the sun inconveniently heats up my previously cold water bottle, and the baby pool fills. Fills and fills and fills.<br /><br />There is an "8" painted on the side of the baby pool to designate that the water is eight inches high. I usually fill the pool so the water level reaches the middle of the painted "8". It's still at the bottom of the eight. I stare at the baby pool. By now, Ryan has arrived, and we chat a little as time slowly passes from my shift. <br /><br />I'm surprised when Mr. Stevenson walks up to me and asks me if I have my watch programmed to alert me when the baby pool is full. I think to myself, <i>"What an absurd question"</i>, but outwardly I attempt to show no signs of admittance of the absurdity of the question. Of course, I say that I don't have my watch programmed to do such a thing. I say that I'll stop the valve when the baby pool is full, I jokingly tell him that I'll surely notice if it overflows. He says something to the effect of, <br /><br /><i>"Nobody wants it to overflow."<br /><br />"But, I need to fill up the baby pool."<br /><br />"I think the baby pool is high enough."<br /><br />"I want to fill it high because evaporation will lower the water level."<br /><br /><b>"There won't be any evaporation."</b><br /><br />"I apologize, I will turn the valve off now."<br /><br />"Ok."</i><br /><br />Then, his wife juts in and says something supporting her husband. I don't even remember what she said. <br /><br />But, I remember thinking, <i>"Now they're ganging up on me? I guess they <b>both</b> enjoy bossing people around..."</i><br /><br />Just slightly annoyed by the fact that this man has ordered me to do something against my will, and better judgement, I turn off the valve and submit to his wishes, always remembering to smile. I start to wonder when the Stevensons will leave the pool and let me be.<br /><br />Again, minutes pass. I see that the unwatered bushes are starting to wilt. I convince myself to water them. If I was a plant, I would want to be watered. I pull out the hose, and Ryan helps me keep the hose from falling into the pool and getting tangled on random pool furniture. I water the first one. Splashes of water bead up on the yellow leaves of the infant sapling. After thirty seconds of hosing, I move onto the next plant. The same process ensues. Then the next plant. <br /><br />I'm surprised again when Mr. Stevenson walks up to me and asks me what I am doing. <br /><br /><i>"I'm watering the plants."<br /><br />"There are no plants to water."<br /><br />"A woman approached me a while ago and told me that she had planted little bushes to fill up the empty spaces between the more mature bushes."<br /><br />"I don't see any new plants."<br /></i><br /><br />I point out each little plant. It is obvious the the casual observer that these little plants were planted here with purpose. They are symmetrically spaced out between each larger bush.<br /><br /><i>"So, when did this woman tell you that?"<br /><br />"About a week ago."<br /><br />"Well, I sprayed the whole grounds with weed killer a little bit ago. I thought those were weeds."</i><br /><br />His wife quips from across the pool, <i>"Yup, he sprayed the whole grounds."</i> <b>As if I couldn't hear what the large man standing a few feet from me was saying.</b><br /><br /><i>"Well, they aren't weeds, sir. I have to water them."<br /><br />"They're practically dead anyways. Stop watering them."<br /><br />"I apologize for watering the plants. I'll put away the hose now."</i><br /><br />With a gracious smile, I put the hose away. Inside, I'm burning. By now, I'm starting to jump to a higher level of annoyance. A level on par with anger. Not to rage yet though. I walk to the food area with Ryan and we eat cookies while mulling over Mr. Stevenson. I vent my anger by talking to Ryan. It helps me. <br /><br />I look at the baby pool and see that the water in it has indeed evaporated. I open the lid to open the water valve again to raise the water level of the baby pool. No more than thirty seconds pass after I put the lid back on before Mr. Stevenson walks up to me and asks me, <br /><br /><i>"What are you doing now?"<br /><br />"I'm filling up the baby pool again. The water is too low."<br /><br />"The water isn't too low."<br /><br />"Well, it's lower than it was before. Sir, the water is about a half an inch below where it was thirty minutes ago, thanks to evaporation."<br /><br />"Go get a measuring tape, why doncha'?<b> There isn't any evaporation.</b>"</i><br /><br />At this point, I'm angry. I keep it inside and say it with a smile,<br /><br /><i>"If you insist. I apologize for the misunderstanding. I'll turn the water off right away"</i><br /><br />I go back to the eating area with Ryan for some more talking. He leaves to go get a bag of chips from his nearby house. In the meantime, Mr. Stevenson & Company decide to all get in the hot tub. With all of them in, they displace too much water. Ryan comes back with the chips and we both laugh about the whole situation. Laughing is a good way to hide negative emotions. When Mr. Stevenson & Company decide to get out of the hot tub, water gets in the pump because there is much less water left in the tub. Mr. Stevenson informs me of this, and I hurriedly shut off the pump. I bring the hose out to replace the water when he decides to walk up on the deck. He says,<br /><br /><i>"I didn't know you could shut off the whole thing."<br /><br />"Yeah, there's a switch in the back. I figure it'll take at least five minutes to fill this tub back up to the previous level."<br /><br />"Don't fill it too high."<br /><br />"I'll try not to, sir."<br /><br />"You can go eat your food with your little buddy now."</i><br /><br />I remember thinking to myself after his last sentence, <i>"<b>Who the fuck does he think he is?</b> Ryan's a <b>'little buddy'</b> now? And he can tell me when I can and cannot eat my <b>goddamn</b> food? I'll <b>fucking</b> tear is <b>ass-clown</b> face off if he decides to shove another <b>bogus</b> order on me."</i> <br /><br />I smiled and walked to the food area. Ryan informs me that he called me "a dog" earlier as he was ordering me to stop the valve on the baby pool. I'm still smiling on the outside, but on the inside <b>I'm ready to <i>brutally</i> rip his testicles out and put them in an <i>anthill </i>for him to desperately fish out.</b> I control myself by talking to Ryan some more. <br /><br />Finally, the Stevensons leave.<br /><br /><i>"Good riddance."</i>, I think to myself.<br /><br />I open back up the valve on the baby pool and water the baby plants again.<br /><br />I really do hope the plants survive.<br />
