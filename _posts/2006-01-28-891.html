Like magic, the English essay appeared before my eyes. Before it disappeared, I was able to snatch it from the air and print it out. <br /><br />Success.<br /><br />I still have a lot of things to do though. These things include the Robotics animation, reading ten chapters of "A Tale of Two Cities", studying for chemistry, drawing random things, and Blendering.<br /><br />Other news, other news...<br /><br />I tried to decide on my schedule for next year a few minutes ago. I look at the list of classes, and it's daunting. Wrong choices mean a year's worth of misery, or a year's worth of paradise. I've learned to never again take the Business classes or Technology classes. My ultimate goal of never taking an art class in high school limits my selection further. Agriculture and Family and Consumer Science classes are out of the question. That gives me a very limited selection of classes, them being science, math, english, and history. The cores of education, so to speak.<br /><br />I've heard about the "MySpace.com" episode of today's Dateline NBC. The article can be found here:<br /><br />http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11064451/<br /><br />I think it talked about how myspace.com is dangerous, and how kids end up being corrupted by such a dangerous tool, pedophiles end up killing the kids, blah, blah, blah. The usual, stuff, you know? Well, my personal opinion is that those kids who are stupid enough to not realize that other people are reading what they post should be stalked down and brutally murdered. A la natural selection. So, for this reason, I do not sympathize with such victims. I hope they died a horrible death. They deserve it for using such inferior netware. <br /><br />But, other than my silly little viewpoints on this issue, what bothers me is that this is exactly the kind of stuff that gets technologically-challenged parents riled up, scared, and enraged. I know that there are thousands of parents who are using their AOL parental controls to tighten up security because of this episode of Dateline. I am absolutely against parental controls. I would have NEVER learned all the things I know about computers and computer-affiliated things if my parents were sticklers about what could and couldn't be accessed. Through trial and error, downloading lots of crap that I shouldn't have, messing around in menus, talking to strangers on forums, chatting away with strangers in tech chat rooms, I now manage all the computers in my house. Full control is mine. But, where would I be today if my parents were early adopters of the "Net Nanny" software? I would probably be much more ignorant than I am now. I would not have discovered my hobbies, I would not have discovered who I am and what I like to do. What a horrible thing it would be if the future I live today was destroyed. But, it's happening to kids all around the country. America is about freedom, right? Parental controls belong in China.<br /><br />I guess parent advocates could defend their case by calling parental controls a wall of "security". But, I would rather have a slightly risky, but intelligent child, rather than an ignorant, protected one. I mean, with parental controls, the freedom does not exist to learn. I know so many people that haven't been able to grasp the computer because their parents cripple the potential of the computer because of irrational fear. The fear comes from shows like these that are meant to boost ratings and get more people to watch the network. This purpose is accompished well, but a byproduct is fear.<br /><br />I am rather grateful for being such an "unprotected" youth.
