Halfway through my shower, I forgot if I washed my hair already or not. For good measure, I did again. But, forevermore, I will not know if I washed my hair once or washed my hair twice. <br /><br />What if my whole life was like that? What if I forgot something every ten minutes?<br /><br />And somehow, after having this conversation with myself in the shower, I find myself thinking about the true value of reading literature. After all, it's just like watching television. Reading a captivating story about a bunch of British schoolboys crash-landing on an island is no different than watching a television show about a bunch of British schoolboys crash-landing on an island. <br /><br />Sure, one can say that the television version doesn't hold all of the innate details that are needed to truely "absorb" the whole story and "read between the lines". Well, how is "reading between the lines" or "absorbing" a story going to affect one's life? If you're a normal, statistically average human being, the allegorical references mentioned in so-and-so book aren't going to make a difference. All that can be learned from a story can be learned just as well, and faster, from a list of facts and rules. The school corporation might as well make a gigantic book of facts as the standard, and only textbook used in schools. I'm sure it would save a lot of paper, as well as increase efficiency. If this was to take place, there would be no more reading of pointless chronicles of fictional characters in an ethereal world.<br /><br />And wouldn't that just make my day.
