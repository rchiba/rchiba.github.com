Justin here-there was another 2hr delay for us today but to me it was really pointless.  All of the roads were plowed.  Then at first period, one of my fellow band members complained that we shouldn't've even had school today.  I couldn't believe him.  he said that the school should have made up for yesterday because yesterday, instead of a 2hr delay, we have a spelling bee.  As usual, people complained about that too.  Anyways, today in communications/comm. a kid name Jimmy Polk was really, REALLY getting on my nerves.  Every day, he acts like idiotic retard and is a huge a-hole.  I'd really wanted to scream at him and tell him to just leave me alone and quit acting stupid.  He shouldn't even be at my table.  He wasn't even assigned it.  But nooOOOOooo, he had to came and sit with us (me, spencer, and zech.)  I don't know what I should do.  He never stops touching my things.  There is one solution to my problem though and that is to go and sit at the empty table.  Then I could actually be able to pay attention instead of trying to "tame" the idiot Jimmy.  Also, it would do loads of help to my citizenship grade. But if I move to the empty table, I will be questioned and probably made fun of for wanting to sit alone by myself.  That happened in the beginning of the year because no one wanted to sit with me (it's nothing new now.)  It always happens in English too.  Whenever we do a group project, I'm always sitting alone at my desk.

<br />Aside from my depressing life of friendship,  I've been having this odd feeling to write a book.  I really don't know why.  But it sounds like a pretty good idea.  The only problem is that I fon't know what to write about.  I'll think of something.  By the way, I'd really like some book requests if you have them: JustinWalker123@msn.com.  I gotta go now.  Later.
