To burst out the new year differently, I've decided to change the site layout. If this site looks the same to you, refresh the page. Anyways, I was fed up with the chaotic, n00bish layout of the previous site, so I decided to clean it up. My inspiration was Google. They support blogger, blogger supports me, so by using the transitive property of equality, Google supports me. Consequently, Google is my friend. Hugs to Google!
<br />
<br />Anyways, enjoy my schwete layout!
