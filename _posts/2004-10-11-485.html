Yea, 
<br />
<br />I'm overburdened, overworked. My feet feel like bricks, and by the way, I stink at diving. My day's been swell. I have a math and french quiz tomorow, not to mention the english character analysis and thesis statement. Just swell... (If you can't tell yet, I'm being sarcastic).
<br />
<br />Diving practice today felt like it went so slowly. So undeniably slow, even Ryan felt it. Possibly because 2 people got hurt today, diving. Rachel skinned her leg, and Thomas cut his lip. The fear was searing through my flesh. Not a hot searing, but a cold searing, like dry ice taped to your forehead kind of searing. I suddenly went cold. I couldn't help but shake. The cold. The scratchy diving board. The terribly frightening water. The fear. I couldn't take it. I have to jump. As I land in the water, my thoughts include, "Am I dead?" and "I can't feel my legs". Imagine this scenario repeating itself for an hour. Yes, an hour...
<br />
<br />Now it is time for study and sleep, a time for a rush of cramming, and to immagine that this is going to happen tomorow too. I just have to tell myself that I will make it. I can make it to the next day of diving practice. Then, it's smooth cruising from there. Smooth cruising...
<br />
<br />I make it to the end of the day today, to study hall, my last class, to find Janet dismayed, as usual. (I know, my commas are everywhere, but live with it.)She called me a genius, which truly disturbed me, because she obviously doesn't know the meaning of "smartness", whatever that means. Seriously, I get good grades. I'm in honors classes. I like to read. But does that mean she can label me something that I obviously am not? I don't think so. Or possibly, maybe, she's being nice to me, a tough question it is.
<br />
<br />I read in the newspaper about blogs and such, and something hit me. Not literally, but in my head. I see so many people who start blogs with great enthusiasm. It eventually trickles down to updation every other day... then to updation on the weekends... then updation every month... until they totally forget about their blog, and they just break off. They might have broken off, but their websites and blogs are still taking up server space. Think about it. It's like space junk. It floats out in cyberspace taking up room and having no purpose. I hate it. Internet pollution is what I call it. Absolutely haneous.
<br />
<br />Talking about absolutely haneous, I heard someone talk about their friends getting drunk and disoriented. That is such a disgrace. Being intoxicated at such a young age. Destined for a life of little success. How can they accept it? Why did they do it? A question that should be answered.
