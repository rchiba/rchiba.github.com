It's all the talk, summer is here.<br /><br />But, to tell you the truth, it's not as spectacular as everyone makes it out to be. Because of this "summer", I am now sitting in front of my computer, rendering the first scene to the animation that I finished five minutes ago. It should also be noted that midnight will be passing in ten seconds. Anyways, there is this illusion of time. In reality, the days are the same days, and the nights are the same nights. But, without school, I'll have to put my efforts into other random things. So, the work never really stops, and I guess I don't really want it to. There, it's midnight, and the computer is on the 14th frame of the 330 frame scene. My elbows burn from putting my arms on the rough, plastic arms to this office chair for so long. My eyes burn in equal intensity from perfecting keyframes, lipsynching (for two hours), and importing random furniture and junk for the background. I'm worried that the computer can't handle things like this because the side of it is starting to get somewhat hot. And the fans inside are getting really loud. Or perhaps that's just because the house is completely silent at the moment, except for my typing.<br /><br />Ok, my computer is definitely overheating. I'll have to stop typing and cancel the render before the insides are toast.<br /><br />Yay for 10 Second Club for ruining my life by addicting me to character animation. Hoorah!
