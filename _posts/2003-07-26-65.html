Hello, its me.
<br />I went to my friends birthday party at an amusement park and it was soooo kool. I have never been on a roller coaster previously but i got to ride a few yesterday. The experience was AMAZING! I am going to ride roller coasters more often. There is also a trick i made up to reduce nausia. It is to clench your teeth so all the blood doesnt go to your head. I reallly have to go to the bathroom , so bye bye;)
