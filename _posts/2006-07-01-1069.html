I rediscovered ArtRage and I've been furiously using my tablet since around 6PM, right after my afternoon sleep. A few minutes ago, I took a step from my doodling and looked at my watch. Almost midnight, and I work tomorrows morning shift. A true "I'm a stupid idiot who can't keep track of the time, nonetheless manage it" moment. But, it's so addictive. I really did think that my tablet would end up being another expensive piece of junk I would regret purchasing. I guess the learning curve was a little too steep for me when I started drawing on it, and that's why I sort of gave up after a few days of practicing. Since 6PM though, I've gotten a lot better, or maybe the program has made it easier for me. Either way, I like ArtRage much better than the 'spensive Corel Painter. <br /><br />The free version of ArtRage is nice, but I'm debating spending $20 for the full program. Unlocking the layers feature seems really appealing at the moment. I never thought I would ever consider paying <i>actual money</i> for software, but here I am, considering it. You can download ArtRage here: <a href="http://www.ambientdesign.com/artragedown.html" title="http://www.ambientdesign.com/artragedown.html">http://www.ambientdesign.com/artragedown.html</a>.<br /><br />There are lots of little insects (two) near my computer monitor. My pool job is slowly getting rid of my fear of bugs. I'm surrounded by bugs at work, so now I sort of just swat them away, and have no problems destroying the smaller ones with my bare hands. Before, I would grimace at the sight of bugs, but I'm more calm now. I'm glad that my fears are curable.<br /><br /><br />
