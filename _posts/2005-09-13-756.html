Today was one of those days. One of those days where you feel like you're reading yesterday's post and feel too tired to even feel bad about anything.<br /><br />A day where walking feels like sulking, where moving feels clunky. Where fluidity flies out of the window, and where you can't even feel the tips of your fingers. The kind of day that beats the emotion out of one until he or she is a bloody pulp.<br /><br />Although, today there was a bit of passion involved. A fiery passion of desire and want. A desire worth sacrifices, and even bodily harm. A desire so intense, that it strikes muscle spasms in the hearts of good students.<br /><br />A desire to get to class on time.<br /><br />Although the chemistry classroom is relatively close to the english classroom, the transition from these two core classes is vicious, every day. Getting to class on time is a based on the second, not the half minute. Time seems to skip those five minutes of transition time. <br /><br />So it all started when I discovered the shocking truth. My chemistry teacher was not going to give me a pass to the next class. I have to admit, that being late on finishing the lab was my fault, but I was in situation to complain. I had no time to even mutter a counterance to this unexpected surprise. I was already a minute and a half into the transition period, and still, lab goggles were strapped to my head. Upon hearing the news, I immediately knew it was time to scramble. I jumped a desk or two, whacked my hip on the side of a lab table, which hurt very badly, and tried to stuff my goggles in the goggle rack. <br /><br />My efforts were a total failure. For every goggle insertion, another goggle fell out of the rack and onto the floor. My intense shaking and nervousness did not help with this situation. For twenty seconds or so, I was a cursing, babbling, shaking wreck, unable to exercise simple motor control. A girl took pity on my situation and was kind enough to put the goggles in for me. So, I took the chance and dashed toward my books, grabbed them all by the armful, and blitzed the hallway.<br /><br />And so, I take my fateful sharp right turn. Here, it's either hit or miss. I either trip and fall, or smoothly proceed on my way, unhindered. Today, luck was on my side as I took my sharp left turn of fate. As I zipped through the halls, taking rights, lefts, and diagonals, I have to focus. Hyperspeed in the hallways fatigues an agile mind, as well as agile muscles. I must triangulate my position relative to the school, calculate collision probabilities and traffic predictions for unseen hallways, factor in the "obese blobs utterly blocking your path with their impenetrable rolls of fat" factor, and estimate arrival time.<br /><br />My estimated arrival time was four letters long.<br /><br />L, A, T, and E.<br /><br />Faces, clothes, whiffs of terrible cologne, and books blurred my vision as I weaved in and out of openings in the crowd. I was like a knife, slicing through the crowd with both nimble quickness and brute force. Unpredictable as the crowd was, I managed.<br /><br />That is, until I felt a short tug on my fabric near my right elbow. I took no notice, and for a split second, I thought the tug was gone. After that split second passed, I heard the tear of papers and the falling of books. I wanted to apologize, I really did, but I kept dashing in and out of little openings that presented themselves within the mass of people. Soon, I was rationalizing to myself. I told myself that the girl probably deserved it, and I probably wasn't the main factor in her mess. The messages I was conveying to myself might not be the most truthful thing to tell myself, but feeling sorry for someone wasn't going to get me to class on time. I thought to myself, "Scew the girl, get to class." I didn't even have time to realize what a immature innuendo I created.<br /><br />By this time, I'm to my locker. I'm running on pure adrenaline. My muscles ache, and I'm out of breath, panting profusely. Sweat beads on my forehead as I hope that my combination is entered correctly. The minute bell rings. Luckily, I hit the right numbers on the dial and I promptly open my locker. There is no time for putting things back in, so I just snatch the english books that I see. Mustering up all of my remaining energy, I pick up the pile of books and dash down the hall. I'm not out of the woods yet.<br /><br />Halfway down the hall, the sharp end of the metal spiral for one of my larger notebooks starts cutting into my arm. Sharp pain shoots up my arm as I dash to my target. I can hardly manage to keep my balance. The books are up to my chin, and I'm stumbling every other step. Red in the face, out of breath, panting, sweating, cursing in my head, delusional, exhausted, rushing, almost there...<br /><br />I make it into the room just as the bell rings. The teacher looks at me funny. Shamed, but proud, from my close call, I promptly take my seat at the back of the classroom. Feeling like exploding, imploding, burning, and puking at the same time, I try to focus on things other than my urge to vomit. The teacher picks up something from her desk.<br /><br />I am rewarded with a paper due on Friday.<br /><br />I don't think I'm ever going to get out of the woods.
