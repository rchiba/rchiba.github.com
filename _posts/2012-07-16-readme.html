When I start reading a good book, I start to want to write a good book. But before writing a good book, I have to learn to write. 

In middle and high school, I wrote in this journal often. It was a habit that developed partially out of a need to tell someone, or something, what was on my mind. I imagine that this is perhaps what has in the past brought some people to paint animals in a cave or kneel down at night and pray. I'd like to imagine that I had a secular version of the same feeling. I'd write about whatever was on my mind, really not even considering the possibility of an audience. But occasionally a friend would come on, write me a happy note if I were sad, or a confused note if I was angry. It was fun, and I think it's a rare feeling, the feeling you get when you realize that somebody read such a personal part of your life and took the time to write you back. This solace we all ask of our friends, and if you're lucky enough to have any, you'll get it back. I had friends, and I was very lucky.

Onward to high school, when I started dating and feeling more confident about myself. Along with the excitement of dealing with an entire slew of violent emotions that are only triggered by relationships of this nature, came a realization that there wasn't a need to write! I could share all of my feelings with this one person, and I could even talk about it, not just write it out. And it would be private, and I could suddenly have two personas. My "normal" self, and the internal monologue that would occasionally trickle to my girlfriend. With a new overflow valve installed, I could plug up the old one, and I stopped writing regularly. As I entered college and started making more close friends, I could share thoughts with more people who were kind enough to listen, and writing eventually became an exercise.
