Justin here repoting for duty.  I just got back from the Lego League 30 minutes ago.  It was a lot more fun than last time.  We stared building! YAAAY!!! I still think we're behind.  Aside from that, I on Ryo's side when it comes to those stupid SPAMMERS.  WHY DON"T YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF WASTING YOUR TIME WRITING CRAP ABOUT RYO YOU IDIOTIC SCUMMBAGS!!!!WHAT"D HE EVER DO TO YOU!!!!NOTHING!!!!  Well, that's all I got to say for now.  See ya.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, just another reminder...QUITE WRITING CRAP TO RYO!!!
