The 10 Second Club is up and running for this month again. Now I can <strike>resume humiliating myself online by making poorly done animations</strike> make a new animation for this month. A big deal for me, but the resurrection of this event comes at an inconvenient time. WIth all of the "have-to's" and "want-to's", it'll just be another thing added to my large list of tasks. I like this month's sound clip though. It'll be fun if I can get myself to finish it before the month ends. With the beginning of school coming speeding toward the present, that'll be a difficult thing to do, I'm willing to sacrifice sleep for the humiliation. It's the <strike>false</strike> hope that I'll get better at animating if I keep practicing.<br /><br />In other news, it's midnight and I haven't gotten past chapter 6 in Grapes of Wrath, which must be read in the coming week. Time to hit the books, again.
