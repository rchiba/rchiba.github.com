I felt like I was going into shock today.
<br />
<br />After a pleasant weekend, the real world feels harsh. This morning, I was wondering what my incentive to wake up was. I was in my bed for an hour trying to figure out a good reason to get out of bed. There wasn't anything special about today, nothing to tease me out of bed so I can function. I just stared at my blue alarm clock for an hour, waiting it to force me out of bed. Waiting for the inevitable disturbance of my peaceful thinking. Eventually, it came and past, I woke up, got on the bus... And I still wondered what my incentive to function was. I couldn't figure it out. By the middle of they day, I got hungry, so I fiugred lunch would be my incentive. Lunch passed and I was still wondering what my incentive was. I wondered while diving practice was going on. What am I working for? I'm still wondering that at this moment. What is my incentive to wake up tomorow? What is my incentive to live?
<br />
<br />I suppose the incentive to live for any life-form is to reproduce itself so it, as a species, can dominate the ecosystem. Humans have already achieved that. I guess we've gone past that incentive. The primal urge has been washed away from our superior intellects. We no longer function as an animal, but as completely different entities. Or maybe not. I'm probably standing on biased ground, since there probably are people out there who live for making more of themselves. I guess I'm just speaking for myself.
<br />
<br />Anyways, someone told me to ask if Ryan was available for the "Sunshine Dance" thing. It kind of made me feel bad, but I said yes. Now I have to remember to tell him. These dances and other student-council sponsored trash should be abolished. It only results in alienation, depression, and self-hate. These supposed morale-boosters are just making us less socially privelaged folks hate ourselves. It makes me feel bad, but since all of the popular people are happy it is arranged accordingly. 
<br />
<br />I suppose the "Sunshine Dance" isn't so bad, as long as you are popular. Otherwise, it makes you feel suicidal. Take that student-council!
<br />
<br />Anyways, my journalism teacher told me that exclaimation points are very unprofessional looking. I don't think she even knows my name. That's why she never calls on me. That's why she doesn't even pay attention to me. She only pays attention to the older kids. I always feel alone in that class. I hate journalism. There is no real meat to the learning. We read the newspaper for about an hour, then we are instructed to do some kind of writing excercize. This cycle repeats itself every day, except today. We were assigned to do an interview with someone who is not a family member or friend. When I got word of this, I felt like dying. I didn't think I would manage. But, I suppose I have to, being functional and all. I despise journalism. For anyone out there searching for Harrison High School Journalism Classes, it stinks. It is discouraging me from being a journalist. I am disgusted by it.
<br />
<br />In other news, I smacked at least ten times in diving today. 3 in the head, 4 in the torso, 2 on the side, and 1 on my knee. This endless torture turned me into one sad, depressed bag of flesh. I was in pain, cold, and mindless. It all started adding up until I started getting really sad. I tried to chanel my sadness into anger, but only resulted in more depressing thoughts. I tried to chanel my sadness into determination, but I just got sadder. I then realized that my thoughts were obsolete. Sadness is a reaction to stress preparing me for an escape. The increased breathing, heartrate, and sensitive perception were obsolete. I didn't need that at the moment, so I just said, "Hey, why get sad? There's no logical reason to it. Your thoughts are obsolete. Forget about it.", and I did forget about it. It was quite a victory. I think that it's a useful skill, knowing when your brain is just running on instinct and not on reason. You can disable the instinct and come to logical terms. 
<br />
<br />I immagine the humans of the future struggling with primitive mind instincts. I hope we eventually evolve to forget about these instincts. In the future, they will be truely obsolete.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I'm stressed out constantly this week, which means that I will be writing alot. Stress/Anger/Depression/Cynicism/Rage=Blog Posting. Simple equation for a blog that makes simple things complicated.
