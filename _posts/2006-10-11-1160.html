I've wasted today away. The past hour I tried to make a "random post" button. It doesn't work. So I'm left to accept defeat and wake up tired and sicker tomorrow. I should have made the better choice and done my homework and slept early. I made the wrong decision. I stayed up late doing stupid things and getting on Second Life. These are the hours in which I hate myself the most.
