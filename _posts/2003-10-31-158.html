Halloween, an interesting holiday I suppose. All the little obese and chubby children going door to door to get their oversized portions of fat and cholerterol. Only to become more obese, get heart cancer, get bypass surgery, and die 20 years early. Interesting Americans, thats all I can say.
<br />I went from house to house, but I didn't want the candy. I just followed Jon Pachke(the Army Dude) and Justin walker (the fellow cow). What can I say? I took part in a rediculous act of shameless stupidity, ending in a death spiral? Oh yea, I got nervous, like Amanda, to go trick of treating. I hate ringing door bells. It makes me feel like a vandalist. Why bother people in a house with a large, obnoxious "DONG"? I hate candy, I think I'll bring them to school and give them to the helplessly hungry, and other individuals. 
<br />         Anyways, tomorow I have a speech practice. 8o' Clock sharp. I have to go to sleep soon then, Ive already waken 1 hour past my bedtime. I hate yet love tomorow. I hate it how I have a ton of things to do, but I love it how I have a ton of things to do. Isn't It oxymoronic? I guess my life is oxymoronic, or more like moronic . Haha... not...
<br />          Also, Meagans party was kinda boring, probably because I am an outcast. My frontal cortex doesn't mingle well with others. Well, what else is there to talk about, oh yea. My note book has about 4 ideas for my opinions page. BUT I DONT HAVE TIME TO TYPE IT OUT. I HATE IT!
<br />Well, thats my moronic life. haha... not...
