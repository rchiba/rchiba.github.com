Long time no update, and for that I apologize blog-thing. I've had a hectic time. So I will update you;
<br />Summer gym isn't as hard as I thought but I've had to miss one day because I got sick. I looked on the scale yesterday and operation weight loss is working! YAYNESS! Also, I'm having lots of fun with my little sister, my book is progressing great, my big sister and I aren't dong so well, I'm getting lots of feedback for my stories and art, Elizabeth (a friend I met after over 4 years of absence) and I are getting along great and...um... That's nearly it. So, you see, my life isn't so bad. Except for the pain in my back and my head right now. Swimming is evil, I ran into the side of the pool at the acme of my glide during the breast-stroke, which is also known as the stupid frog stroke, lol. Anyways, chat later!
