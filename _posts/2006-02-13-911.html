It's going to be one of *those* weeks.<br /><br />It's midnight, and I've hardly scratched the surface of all the homework and school-affiliated work that is due tomorrow. <br /><br />If you see me tomorrow, expect me to be either a fritzed lunatic, or zombified.<br /><br />BANG.<br /><br />It's officially Tuesday.<br /><br />Happy Tuesday. <br /><br />To tell you the truth, I'm not really feeling too happy.
