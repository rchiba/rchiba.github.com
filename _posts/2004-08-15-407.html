But that 's a personal thing. I'm not much of a sociable person in a "party" like situation. Most of the time I was folowing Devin anyways. There were alot of kids that I didn't know, but they knew me. I also didn't expect alot of people who were there.
<br />
<br />The hike was another story though. I loved it. There were huge cliffs and crevasses and watching Devin risk his life was also exciting. You would have never guessed I was excited because I was kind of quiet most of the time, but I was thrilled. I'm a very quiet person. I wish I had pictures of the hike, but I didn't bring my camera to the hike (duhhh, water and dirt) but maybe next time. &nbsp;<a href='http://www.hello.com/' target='ext'><img src='http://photos1.blogger.com/pbh.gif' alt='Posted by Hello' border='0' style='border:0px;padding:0px;background:transparent;' align='absmiddle'></a>
