Less and less time for more and more things.<br /><br />Homework, school, drawing, electronics, network maintainance, socializing, extracurricular activities, music, etc.<br /><br />Blech, maybe on Friday I'll have some happy time. Or not, because I'll just be brooding over the next English assignment I'm handed. Blech.
