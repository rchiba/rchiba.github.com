Emergency. Studying hard for test tomorrow with a book I don't have. Not good. It's late. I don't think school ever rewarded a single student for sleeping. I'll take that notion to heart tonight. I feel a little sick from knowing that I'm in a tight situation that I put myself in. I feel a little sicker because I've lost a book and need to find it soon.
