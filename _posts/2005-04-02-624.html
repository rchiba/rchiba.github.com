My parakeet, Vanilla, died today. She was seven years old.<br /><br />It was pretty traumatic, but I made it through the day. I think that at someone's death, it should be a celebration of what that someone accomplished. It shouldn't be a sadfest of weeping. There's no point in crying over spilled milk. Yes, it's unfortunate that someone died, but they wouldn't want you suffering because of them... unless they were some kind of sadist. Most people aren't sadists. Zach is an exception.<br /><br />I buried my Vanilla in a little red box. It is in a shallow grave beside the two largest trees in my back yard. There is a little stick where the grave is.<br /><br />Things die. I just have to deal with it.
