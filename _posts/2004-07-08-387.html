Hey blog-thing... ugh. what a day. Guess why I can't do any more sit ups for a while.... can you guess? I suppose not. Well, it's because I now have a burn on my spine from the confounded floor. I don't know how it happened, but believe me, I'm feeling it. Especially with this anti-bacterial cream my grandmother just put on it. Goodness, she says it looks bad, but not worthy of a doctor visit (thank goodness). But anyway, now my grandma will have to write me a note of excuse. I feel like such a weakling... but as the health teachers always preach, don't adgitate wounds/injuries or else they will only get worse. Therefore, here I am, tellin you all about this depressing predicament. The good thing? With my 'ab-buster' I can do a rendition of sit ups. YAY! 
<br />Anyway, blog-thing, I think my group will have to run the mile tomorrow. Joy, and yippy skippy. I haven't looked at the schedule for when I have track, but I'm fairly sure I have it tomorrow. If I don't, Huzzah! 
<br />I can't wait until tomorrow. For one, a thing I've been waiting for will finally come in! Kudos to me! AND I get to spend the weekend with a friend, Elizabeth. Huzzah AND Kudos! lol, talk later;
