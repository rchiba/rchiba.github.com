Average Yo here,
<br />Anyways, it is past my bedtime and I am typing in my bedroom. Not wanting today to float away, I decided to type. Anyways, today is Super Bowl Sunday or whatever. After half of it, I got sick of the halftime show and went to my room. Anyways, today was pretty boring. Nothing much happened. Just another Sunday. Also, I wrote revised versions of my speech conclusion. I can't believe that I am going to have to memorize that thing. It's longer than a page, how am I going to memorize it? Anyways, my dad said that he won EVERY scholarship he applied to which made me feel obligated to do the same. I feel so incompetent next to my dad. I feel like I HAVE to do everything and I can't. Actually, I can, I'm just a woossie.
<br />
<br />Anyways, just another Sunday. Tomorow, I have to take a myth test and all these other things. Then on tuesday, I GET TO GO TO HARRISON. I am so excited/estatic. I wonder what it'll be like. My mom said that that high school was tiny, so I am going to try to not be intimidated. I wonder how other people will react to it. I wonder if I'll have the time to post on tuesday. If I do, It will be big.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I've done about 1/4 of my terms of service. I am at a wall at this point and I can't think of anything else to include in the terms of service. 
<br />Well, that's all in my boring yet stable life.
<br />
