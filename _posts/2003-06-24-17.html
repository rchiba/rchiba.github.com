Hello, its a new day and it is still nice and sunny. It is morning and I always start my day with a little computering. I will probably wash my dog today and do other things. Other than that, it will just be another summer day. I just ate breakfast and I gotta go to the bathroom. Anyways, I saw this thing on 20/20 and I thought it was really stupid. These city beutification workers are fineing people who own buissinesses with signs that are colorful. Don't u think its just plain dumb? I sure think it is. I forgot to call anyone yesterday and I think I won't today. I just don't have the nerve. My dog is barking right now and my stomach is too, so I gotta go.
