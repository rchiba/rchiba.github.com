Today, today, today,
<br />The publicity problem goes down quite a bit, but now Kyle's on my back because I hurt his finger. Im sorry kyle. Anyways, Today was more average than expected. I am going to finish my Comm report tommorow. Also, I gotta ace the Math Test. It's gonna be a bit hard, because it is graphing. Hopefully it will be easily aced. There isn't much to talk about today, apparently. I hate days like this. Ok, let me think about what I should talk about. Ok, I got an idea. Why does England and America destroy 90% of their forests and all those poor rainforest countries can't even cut a few trees without hippies coming and hugging the trees? Think about it. 95% of the rainforest is still intact. I just want to say that I hate it when people say that I am talking "nerd" or I am to "complicated" or to use "layman's terms". I am fine. I think my understandability is fine also. Ok, that's about it today.
<br />OH YEA, BEN TAYLOR STOP!
<br />I am going to an optometrist today. I am afraid. I'm gonna look like a NERD tomorrow.
