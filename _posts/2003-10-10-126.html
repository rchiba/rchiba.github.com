The YO is back. Ok, everything seems to be all clear, signs of the publicity has ended, now I can come out of the little hole in the ground.
<br />Ok, great, I have time to write, finnally. I am constanly doing homework these days and I never have time to type. Oh well... Anyways, I really hate alot of people. Not just any peoples, but those select few.. few... You know who you are... Its not like a threat or anything, It's life. You hate some, you like some. Well, let me elaborate. I really hate it when people call me smart, AND THEN criticize me, insult me,or not listen to me! Hello smarty, It's ok, I'm not as smart as you, smartsmartsmartsmartsmart!!! WHY DO PEOPLE CALL ME SMART AND THEN DON'T LISTEN TO ME??? I HATE IT WHEN THIS HAPPENS! Also, I would like to put a WARRANT on Miles H. He is acting very peculuar(isnt he always?) so keep your eyes peeled. He might say something disrespectful to the upmost of disrespect(Mom jokes). I really hate him sometimes, but he's human, like all of us. Hey hey hay... E-MAIL ME FOR FUN, GIVE ME IDEAS, MENTIONS TO WRITE INTO MY POSTS, ANYTHING, OR JUST FOR FUN, At:
