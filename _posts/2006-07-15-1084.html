I was at the pool for eleven hours today. The sun will do things to dyou. It'll even make you start to type "you"s with a "d". My screen is black, and the text I type is green. These words slowly build and make the green swath longer. I aim to fill the screen two times over with the green. I know I can't though. I hate nights like this.<br /><br />Working at the pool today, I talked with Ryan about how a certain family seems not to talk to us, as pool attendants. The family usually nonchalantly walks up to the "sign-in" table with a smile on their face (whether the smiles are genuine or not are beyond me). Ryan and I both cheerfully greet them. They ignore us, do not make eye contact, quickly sign the sheet, and walk away. They have consistently been doing this ever since I started working. It bothers, and mystifies, both of us. The questions that remain unanswered:<br /><br />Why do they constantly avoid eye contact?<br /><br />Do they have something to hide from us pool attendants?<br /><br />Are they really top secret Russian spies?<br /><br />Although these questions may never be answered, I hope that someday they overcome whatever is holding them back from being friendly, and look into our eyes and smile at us, instead of the sign-in sheet. <br /><br />The act of avoiding eye contact (which I am guilty of) bothers me, because it's a sign of many negative things. A signal of superiority, concealment, anxiety, anger, fear, or a combination of any or all of the above. The world should make more eye contact.<br /><br />On a random note, I put up a sign a few weeks ago on the water fountain that said, "Out of Order: very hard water". At the time, I knew that something was wrong with the water fountain, and after a lady filled up her water bottle with greenish-brown water, I decided to stick up a sign warning people of the doomsday water. David, an old man who is really nice, and keeps things running around the pool, came by and commented on the sign. <br /><br />He said, "Whoever wrote that sign had no idea what the hell they were talking about". <br /><br />He said that because the compressor has nothing to do with the water quality, and because the compressor was working, the water fountain was still "in order'.<br /><br />I felt stupid.<br /><br />But, of course, I didn't tell him that I wrote the sign. <br /><br />I may not be safe though. My handwriting is very different than that of any of the other pool attendants. I think I have very scratchy handwriting. Being the sly old/senile fox that he his, he probably already figured out that I wrote the sign.<br /><br />Oh well, I'm not going to be bothered over it. I made a mistake, and I'll admit it.
