Let's talk about me. I mean, why would one read this if one didn't care about me? Me, me, and more me.<br /><br />What's there to say about me? <br /><br />My Second Life profile reads: <i>"I can't dance, I can't sing, and I sure can't buy anything because I'm too darned poor. But what's important is enjoying life, isn't it? Meet me, I like to have friends!"</i><br /><br />That's the kind of attitude I wish I had, <b>but I don't.</b> I have knowledge that I'm inferior, so I hate myself. The fact that I hate myself even though there are many people who would wish to be in my position makes me hate myself even more. I feel as if I've explained this beyond comprehension, but that's a large chunk of what makes me myself.<br /><br />I wake up each morning to the same routine. Things that go through my mind during the start of an average weekday:<br /><br /><i><ul><li>"mmmfff bleh"</li><br /><li>"What was I just dreaming of?"</li><br /><li>"Please tell me that time is lying to me"</li><br /><li>"Pick up books. Wake up and pick up your books."</li><br /><li>"My neck hurts."</li></ul><br /></i><br /><br />I get on the bus and sleep, or talk to Ryan. Upon which, I arrive at school. I see school as an essential part of my routine, and my mental stability, but I also see it as a restrictive element in my comfort level. For the first 3 periods, I drift as if I'm still asleep. If French class is terrible, I always tell myself, <i>"I can't let it be<b> one of those days</b>. I just can't.</i>" Then, as the day progresses, things build up, until the excitement reaches critical level in Chemistry. <br /><br />After school, QuizBowl takes over, and my quality of life spirals downward quickly.<br /><br />I get home and do homework until I'm done. I get on the computer and type this. I'm exhausted.<br /><br />This post, much like my mind during the writing of this, has spiraled downward quickly. <br /><br />I'm going to pass out.
