This keyboard is an instrument I don't play well. <br /><br />The warning bell rings and nothing is different. The same English class at the same time of day. The teacher hasn't gotten up to start the class yet, students are roaming the room, searching for social contact. Andrew stumbles upon me. <br /><br />Just like every other day. He comes up to me and says his hello. And I always wonder, day after day, why does he come up to little 'ol me? His relaxed, pale green shirts, I can't forget them.<br /><br />But, why me? I'm not important, I'm not a witty conversationalist. My entertainment value is limited before lunch. Sprouting out of my ears are not valuable insights, just stupid little things that he shouldn't, wouldn't concern himself with. Petty, petty thoughts. I just don't understand, because I don't deserve to be near him. Does he feel sorry for me? <br /><br />And on his wrist is something he hasn't really explained to me, a red band. <br /><br />I lost a lot of confidence in my level of trust between us when he didn't tell me of its significance. <br /><br />I never should have thought that trust would be something so easy to attain.  <br /><br />A boring tone rings through speakers, flowing into the room and quieting the children down. Class begins. <br /><br />In my uncomfortable seat, I'm feeling tired, hectic, and sad. You see, one class period earlier, I was fighting a math worksheet, or rather, fighting myself to finish a math worksheet. One math problem on the worksheet I couldn't finish. I got so worked up over it.<br /><br />But, math time is over. English time has started.<br /><br />After much chaos and disobedience, Mrs. VanHyfte begins reading example essays from classmates.<br /><br />One by one, the doves in my head holding up strings tied to my self-esteem, one by one, they are shot down. Heads ripped from necks, wings torn from bodies, <b>crimson orifices squirting streams of steaming fluid</b>. Fired on not by enemies, but by friends.<br /><br />The example essays are good, great! Wonderful strings of words, they flow, they mold, they are something of an art. Such great examples they use, their thesis statements are <i>crystalline</i> clear, and the transition couldn't be any smoother, and the knowledge! <i>Such vast banks!</i><br /><i><br />I just don't have it.<br /><br />I just don't have it anymore</i>.<br /><br />My essay.<i> It didn't have it.</i> It's obvious from the stark contrast between the grandeur of my peers' essays and my pathetic shitstorm of words. <br /><br />I look at all of my writing since the very first elementary school book report. Maybe I never had anything in the first place.<br /><br />These words that spew forth on this page, and the archives, and the journals and essays and articles written and copied and forgotten. These words.<br /><br /><i>They just don't have it.</i><br /><br />Maybe there was never any passion, I was never really a person. My feelings never strong, dialogue never engaging. Vocabulary equivalent to a mentally-handicapped squirrel with one leg. And I can never really make myself happy to try, try, try to transfer my thoughts into words. Because, simply, I'm not enough. I don't deserve the things I have.<br /><br />So why does Andrew walk up to me in English class every day?<br /><br />Why do people want me to come to social events? And why does someone else love me?<br /><br /><i>How do I deserve these things?</i>
