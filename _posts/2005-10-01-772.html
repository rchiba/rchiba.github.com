Today plodded along at what felt like 26kbps.<br /><br />It was not a very engaging day. Besides researching at the library and contacting the leader of the Harrison Robotics Team, today was a standard weekend day. Or so I thought as I drove toward a restaurant this evening.<br /><br />Saturday is a good day for eating out. The crowds are tolerable, and the time is convenient. So, why not? I mean, it's not like there's anything else going on. <br /><br />Wrong idea. <br /><br />I arrive at the restaurant, and carefully park in the corner. I open the door with a click, and step out. It's a nice, cool day. I'm wearing a lime green collared shirt and orange basketball shorts. I stand out like... well... an asian kid wearing funky bright clothes. I never really care about how I look anyways, since I've adopted the "Harvey Pekar" style of thinking. He's a genius, you know, this "Harvey Pekar".<br /><br />I walk through the doors, take a snappy glance at the occupants of the restaurant. The notion hits me like a pile of bricks strapped onto a primitive steam locomotive. Tonight is the night of the formal high school dance. Sitting down, waiting for a server to be "right with us", I sincerely hope that I do not know anyone in this fray of teenagers. <br /><br />A server comes, and we all sit down. I see someone I know. Then another person. All in tuxes or dresses. I mutter some expletives to myself and collect my thoughts. I'm surrounded by people I know, wearing formal attire, sporting dashing jewelry and flower pins, talking to their dates, laughing, enjoying themselves. Options of escape are slim to none, and I'm stuck sitting on the outside of the booth. I'm exposed on all flanks, vulnerable, socially incapacitated. Accepting utter defeat, I pull out my hx4700 computing unit and start tinkering around with it. I keep my head bowed, forcing my eyes down to the screen of my savior, the computer. Eye contact with my peers is strictly denied. To look into the eye of them would be like looking into Pandora's Box. Feeling out of place, I blush a bit as I reach over to take a sip of my water. I sight everyone out, using peripheral vision only. I manage to identify three people, the others I don't know obviously are in my grade. A cold feeling makes its way through my body. I try to focus on the screen.<br /><br />Seconds of this excruciating game of mental cat-and-mouse pass, then minutes, then a half an hour, then an hour. Finally, my formally dressed peers brush off the crumbs from their snazzy clothes. The stalemate is broken, and I have achieved victory.<br /><br />At last, I allow myself to look up, and make eye contact with other human beings. The evening proceeds smoothly, but only on the surface.<br /><br />Inside, I was mangled, scarred. Even though I knew that I was right about the dance being a ripoff, I couldn't help feeling ashamed, inferior, and embarassed about not going to this social occasion. Still, I can feel the social antagonism enveloping me.<br /><br />Well, at least one good thing came out of this ordeal. I have something to write about.
