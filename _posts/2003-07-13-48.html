Hi, I am sleepy.
<br />It is time to go to bed and I gotta go soon. I just came back from Shishirs house and I am pooped out. I took a 4 hour nap but i am still pretty sleepy. Anyways, shishirs party was OK. We went to the movies, but most of the time people were insulting me. Insult fest galore. It was fun, but abusive though. I wish my friends had a little more respect for me. At the movies we saw LXG. It was pretty good, but kind of repetitive storyline. I had fun though.
<br />I am tired now, so Good Night ;)
