Typical day, again. That's what makes it typical right?<br /><br />Endless minutes wasted loathing over products on thinkgeek.com have made me unhappy. My unhappyness is also stimulated by my depressing music of radioheadness... <br /><br />In French, I've decided I'm an utter failure. I'm just not a French person. Languages don't come easy for me. As I make these excuses up, I realize that doing this is just a sad way of trying to compensate for my failures. I try to justify my failure. That makes me sick.<br /><br />I was daydreaming in class today and I thought about getting a handgun. You know, in the movies the guy with the gun always wins. If there's an apockalypse, you've got a (temporary) safeguard. A handgun would be a nice commodity. As I daydreamed, I recognized my misjudgement. If I had a handgun, I would probably hurt myself in situations like this. Note to self: don't buy weapons.<br /><br />I guess that's the lesson of the day. I've just got to stick to my pacifistic morals and everybody will benefit.
