I'm amazed. Amazed that the painful final exams are over. Amazed that I won't be having school for the next 2 weeks. Amazed that I've met new people over flickr.com. Amazed that people are actually reading what I'm writing. I'm amazed. Dazed, perhaps.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I decided to write a letter to Santa Claus (a.k.a. Saint Nicholas). It goes something like this...
<br />
<br />Dear Santa,
<br />
<br />I want a de-commercialized Christmas. You are a derivative of a religeous figure. Unfortunately, you have caved into the commercial zealots that now run this world. You have disgraced me. Santa, you are being used. Used by marketers, cons. Santa, you are the cause of enourmous consumer debt. Santa, why have you failed in your mission?
<br />
<br />Santa, today I read a letter addressed to you. Sorry for snooping in your mail, but this issue concerns me. The letter I found read, "Dear Santa, I want a Game Boy SP for Christmas. I wish for $100,000,000,000 and a car. I want 2 BB guns. I want a Playstation 3. I want to be rich.-Hector Berumen, 11".
<br />
<br />If you look carefully, you see three objectives you, Santa, have spawned. Hector wants to be rich. Hector want guns. Hector wants extravagant electronics. Hector is a corrupted youth. Santa, you have corrupted him.
<br />
<br />Santa, why not put some restrictions on your gift-giving? You promise children anything if they are good, but who enforces that law? I haven't heard of a child not getting their gifts on Chrstmas since the Vietnam War. Even Jews and African Americans have their spinoffs to please their envious children. The truth of the matter is, Santa, the rich kids get more, and the poor kids get less. I guess you're not an equal opportunity kind of person...
<br />
<br />Santa, why do you sit in a mall? The mall is for people who have money, too much. People pay you to sit on your lap. What ever happened to charity?
<br />
<br />You know, Santa, there's a place where you're needed. Stop spending your time taking money from people at a mall and go. Go to the poverty-stricken Ethiopian refugee camps. Go to the starving and dying of war-torn countries. Anywhere but rich and fat America. Santa, stop selling and start caring.
<br />
<br />Why are you here Santa? If you give up your real purpose, will you have any true purpose to your existence? Do you exist for the sole purpose of pacifying America's youth, while spoiling them at the same time? Are you there to encourage children to spend, not save? Why, Santa, why?
<br />
<br />By the way, Santa, why are you obese? Is food that important to you? Is an obese, red man sitting on a urine-drenched throne in the mall a good role model for children? Try Atkins or something. I've heard carribou meat is quite a delicacy.
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />
<br />Ryo Chiba
