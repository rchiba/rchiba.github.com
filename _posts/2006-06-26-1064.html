A new event, delivered to me today was my first paycheck. The son of my "boss" rang my doorbell and gave to me a little white envelope. I didn't immediately know what the envelope  contained. I'm so conditioned to think of envelopes as gateways to scams, spam, and credit card offers (which are in both previously mentioned categories). I later opened this particular envelope to find money. Now I like envelopes just a little more.<br /><br />I've always had a distrust of the postal service. It's an admirable thing to be a courier of the people, but it's not so admirable to be a courier of bothersome junk mail. The system has no ability to regulate the transmission of these often distastefully colorful advertisements. In mailboxes around the world, legitimate mail is watered down by a byproduct of society, a byproduct of naive people. <br /><br />Or maybe this society is a bunch of naive people. You're naive, I'm naive, that socialist bastard in the corner is naive, we're all naive. Everyone thinks they know something, but hardly anyone ever does. At school, one can see students arguing over topics that they do cannot see through the barbed restrictions of their own mind. In the world, one can see adults bickering over issues that they simplify to fit in the confines of their simple thought processes. And I, right now I am generalizing whole age groups so I can make sense of it all. But, even if it "makes sense" to me, I'll never understand it.<br /><br />I graded many papers today. One of the stacks took me an hour and a half. I can understand why teachers often complain of grading papers. Then again, they get paid for it, and I volunteer to do such things, so they have no reason to whine. I explained factoring to a Russian kid today. I thought his accent was the neatest thing ever. Unfortunately, I'm not that great of a teacher, so it took a while for me to get the explanation across. <br /><br />I would watch more television if news anchors had Russian accents.
