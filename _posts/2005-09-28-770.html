I was watching the news, and CNN was showing a supposedly "compelling" attempt to rescue a displaced dolphin in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />I agree with the newscasters. This report is "compelling".<br /><br />Although, I find this "compelling" should be used as a negative connotation. To see about ten people, coming together, supplying countless hours, a large truck, and medical equipment to a dolphin came across to me as completely absurd.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I think it's logical to save the people before the animal. Why didn't these heartless animal helpers decide to help some humans for a chance? There are people dying out there, needing trucks, equipment, and effort. And to see people wasting these precious resources on a mere animal is shocking. It's disgusting how inhumane these people are being to their own kind. They make a statement in their "valiant rescue". They are telling me that the stupid, insignificant dolphin is more deserving of life than a human. I think these animal rescue "heroes" are shams. How can anyone value the life of an animal more than that of a human? It just goes without saying.<br /><br />I suppose it's one of those irrational things that seem to never stop going on in the world. But, this time, it costs lives. <br /><br />And that isn't good. If you're going to save a dolphin, stop and go save some people. People have potential to improve society. Dolphins have potential to reproduce, do circus tricks at over-priced theme parks, and die.
