Today was one of those "bright sunshiney" days that the radio tells me about. There were deadly UV rays everywhere today! It was so exhilarating. I mean, you step out and get free radiation. Step in the car, more cell-deforming sun! Who needs to kill yourself artificially in a tanning salon when you can just get cancer the old fashioned way? Let's go outside and PARTY!<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was a "bright sunchiney" and cold day. My hopes and dreams utterly shattered. In the meantime, I'll just rant about how stupid tanning is. Bombarding yourself with radiation for the sole purpose of vanity is just absurd. It's about as idiotic as spraying flamable liquid in your kitchen and lighting it on fire, upon which your house catches on fire. Then, you smother your face into the burning toxic fire. As the flesh peels from your skin, you dial 411 and scream in agony. It's at that level. I'm telling you, don't go tanning. It's stupid. Completely illogical.<br /><br />I hate stupid tanning. I absolutely hate it.
