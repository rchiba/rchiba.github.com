The window is dark, but the room is bright.<br /><br />It's an hour from being midnight, and I'm supposed to be sleeping right now. This, right now, this time that I have sitting on my desk with me, is the time that I am supposed to be using for making up for lost sleeptime. Sleeping 5 hours a day for the past week has worn me down, so why am I sitting in my office chair with the oldies radio station blaring from my stereo?<br /><br />Well, the fact of the matter is that my biological clock has been skewed. Now, I begin to feel sleepy only at 11PM, start falling asleep at midnight, but still awake at 5AM each day. The long-term effects of this behavior has yet to be determined. I'm sure that it will be determined by the end robotics season.<br /><br />My english essay has yet materialized from thin air. I'm still waiting for it to come into being. It's not doing so. This frustrates me.<br /><br />Recently, I think someone told me that I broke 7,000 visitors or something. And occasionally, people will mention this site when I'm talking to them. Normally, this bothers the hell out of me. But, now I've accepted the inevitable. I've accepted the fact that people will read the words that I type out and publish. Right now, at this very moment, I realize that there will come a time when my words will be used against me, but who really cares? I really shouldn't even censor or pay attention to what I say. What I have to say is what I have to say. If I hate someone, why shouldn't I say so? It's *other* peoples' decision to read this nonsense. The responsibility lay not with me.<br /><br />So, my plan of action for this weekend will be this.<br /><br />1) Obsess over the completion of my English essay.<br />2) Worry about the possibility of grammatical errors in my essay.<br />3) Muddle my way through words to finally get a rough draft of my essay.<br />4) Finish the essay.<br />5) Shred the essay to pieces in a blinding rage against English class.<br />6) Feel stupid after realizing that I wasted paper.<br />7) Go to robotics feeling stupid after realizing that I wasted paper.<br />8) Print out my essay again.<br />9) Feel guilty about the paper wasting incident.<br />10) Delete and restart english essay after realizing that it sucks.<br />11) Go back to step one.
