With good news, there's always a tad bit of bad news. With bad news, there's always a tad bit of good news. Life is about duality, and news and actions so pure are never found. Anyone can spin anything with both a positive and a negative view. So with the arrival of new computer equipment comes some bad news.<br /><br />I might have mentioned this before, but I've started to notice that the main computer is getting cranky. After listening to the computer for a bit, and exploring the file system, I've come to believe that a few sectors of my hard drive have become corrupt. The problem lies within the "My Documents" and a few of the "Program Files" folder. I've heard of problems with these folders before, as they rest on a very vulnerable, volatile area of the hard drive. Due to environmental issues, my own fault, time, or the manufacturer, the hard drive is beginning to cough and sputter. At this point in time, I can only expect the worse. I'm looking for a utility to repair the disk (the Windows chkdisk utility doesn't work). Luckily, recently, a second (larger) hard drive was added. So in the worst case scenario (that the bad sectors are actually a misaligned platter), there'll be the back-up already installed in the computer. <br /><br />Tomorrow, I hope to find a solution this problem.<br /><br />For the time being, I'll live my sleepless life away.
