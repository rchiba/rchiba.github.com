Oh my goodness, blog-thing. My dog just got run over by a motorbike. It seems so unreal, I feel sick to my stomach. All we can do is see how she does in the next hour. Kurt thinks it might be serious. It’s almost too much. I can’t bear to hear her crying. Oh my god, how could this have happened? How could this have freakin’ happened? She was just fine this afternoon and now she could have internal bleeding. Oh my god, I have no idea what to think. I feel so sick right now. I wanna cry and I can’t. Why aren’t we going anything now? She’d bleeding, it could be serious! Yet we have to wait! How messed up is that, huh? HOW MESSED UP! My god… this is going to kill me, I know it will. If she does die I’m gonna loose it. I swear I’ll loose it if she dies. Oh my god…Ok, big claming breath. There we go.

<br />OK, It’s been a few moments. I had to bike like crazy to find the guy and ask him if he ran Cracker completely over. He didn’t, and he got hurt. Kurt and Mom say it serves him right. Driving a motorbike on any road is illegal. Poor Cracker, thank goodness there’s no eternal bleeding. 
<br />Well, that was a couple years off my life…
