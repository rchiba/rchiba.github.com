Hello, I have been on a lazy streak because I have so much on my mind, or maybe thats an excuse, i dont know. Anyways, yesterday, Justin came over and we had lots of fun. We went to school and registered and guess what, I GOT A SMALL LOCKER!!! NNOooOOOOOooo!!!! Why does it always happen to me!??!??!?! Ohhhhh welll.... Life isnt perfect. It might be for some people, ***cough***alexi***cough***philipii***cough***popular***cough*** you get the point. Well, as of now, it is 6 days till school, yes kids, 6 days. You can count them on your hands as they get smaller and smaller. Smaller smaller smaller.... I'll try to use this site as a reference at school. I'll share school stories, for school is meant for rumors. They even arrange the classes so rumors start! For example, they have 4 minuite breaks between classes, right??? Well, 4 minuites is more than enough time( sometimes) so the extra 30 seconds or so, you can exchange gossip and rumors. This is the prime time where reputations are made and broken. In that 30 seconds, your whole life coud change. So, when you go to school, you take a gamble. A gamble if lost or won could make you an eternal idol, or geek. That is my rant and advice for today, check back soon everyone! AND JUSTIN, PLEASE UPDATE
