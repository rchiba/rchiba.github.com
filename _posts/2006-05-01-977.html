The truth comes out.<br /><br />I've got lots of time on my hands. But, efficiency slows to a crawl due to a number of personal factors of mine. The main factor being my lack of sleep. Second being my lack of motivation. Third being my inability to focus on a piece of paper when there is a computer screen within an arm's reach.<br /><br />The thing is, the less I sleep, the less I can concentrate. The less I can concentrate, the later I have to stay up to finish my homework. The later I have to stay up to finish homework, the less I can sleep. In this way, a horrible death spiral becomes evident. Since I have no one to blame but myself, I'll divert the blame to an inanimate object, or in this case, extracurricular activity. <br /><br />*points finger to Robotics*<br /><br />Bah, it's all gone to waste. My night has gone to waste. It's always like this, and it's so frustrating. I get to sleep at a time that is just late enough to create mental havoc for me in the morning, but just early enough to cut into the time allocated for working ahead on school things. Yes, I have no word better than "things" to describe the stack of papers that I bring home from school each day. Perhaps I can hope that this weekend will bring sleep. But, I can't expect much, as finals week is coming up, which means stacks of final projects to finish this coming weekend.<br /><br />I'm stuck in a hole, and the cavalry won't be arriving until Friday night. <br /><br />Sometimes I hear my peers talk about watching television, or going to a friend's house, or participating in extensive recreational activities. Every time I hear these things, my blood pressure rises and my head starts spinning. It's hard to comprehend enjoying life so much at this time, and so many conversations are much like watching the world prance around and be merry from across a transparent barrier. So close to happiness, but so isolated from it. But if I am to suffer for being myself, then so be it.<br /><br />I shake my fist at you, fate.
