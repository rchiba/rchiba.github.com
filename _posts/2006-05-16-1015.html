I think it's so weird thinking about death.<br /><br />Something so inevitable, but so mysterious. Entire religions, songs, philosophies, and rituals are based on death. It's both scary and exciting that even I will die. And to think, all of the people I sit next to in all my classes, all of my friends, all of the people I care about, will die. They will cease to exist. And I think that it's so odd, how we value life so, and how people still mourn over death. You would think that over thousands of years of death people would begin to realize that death is the result of life, and stop caring as much. I mean, it happens. It isn't very efficient or productive to be bothered by something as commonplace and expected as death. Perhaps, eventually people will learn to convert their sorrows into work. For the time being, we live by the heart, and not by logic.<br /><br />Apparently, it is socially acceptable to grieve, and socially unacceptable not to do so. Suspects in homicides have been taken in based on how much they mourn. Being unemotional about death has been labeled as suspicious. This brings me to my point. Most people tend to express the value of one's life through grieving. But, what is the point if the person doesn't exist anymore? If only one could focus all of that negative energy and put it to good use by caring about that person while they were still <i>alive</i>. There is no purpose in honoring a pile of dead flesh. The value should be placed on the life, not the carcass. <br /><br />I see people, not dead people, but rude people. Angry, sad, crazy people. People at school, people at the store. People on the bus, and people everywhere. People not functioning at their optimum level because of their emotions. It all comes to the fact that people hurt people, emotionally and physically. We all hurt each other. It's a big race to see who can hit who with an aluminum bat the hardest. Yes, everybody makes mistakes, but enough to result in tears? How many mistakes can one make? From the state of the world, it seems that they are not mistakes, but consequences of being human. It is no error in the human mind that causes people to irritate others. It is an attribute, a predictable factor, a hard-wired response to aid in survival. But, it <i>becomes</i> a mistake when one does not realize that they themselves must control this primal urge in order to impact others in a positive way. <br /><br />What people often don't realize is that the innate value of life is being destroyed when social conflict and ill will spreads. It's just as bad as not caring about a death in the family, or the death of a friend, if not worse. It sounds odd, stupid, absurd. But, the way I see it, treating someone with respect while they're still alive is many times worse than treating someone without respect when they are dead. <br /><br />Let's all get along.<br /><br />And while we're at it, let's save the whales.
