<s>I got emotionally unstable in English because of some stupid, insignificant essay. You know, it's really screwed up. I know it's not important, that essays are fine and dandy. But, you know, when I made that mistake, and when I spent my weekend summarizing chapters of Moby Dick as punishment, I thought the hell would be over.<br /><br />That somehow I would be redeemed. That I would escape that mistake. That I would <span style="font-style: italic;">move on</span>.<br /><br />It appears I cannot move on. That another <span style="font-weight: bold;">thing</span> comes up because of my stupid, stupid, stupid misunderstanding.<br /><br />And, the mistake repeats itself. The misery perpetuates more misery. By the time you know it, the extra essay will fail my test, lower my GPA, I'll have to quit school and live the homeless life, travel the country with a harmonica and a rice cooker, and die quietly, a fat, wrinkley sleazeball in front of a cheap slot machine in a Mississippi casino.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be so picture perfect then?<br /><br />I think I felt so bad about it because I was so confident, so confident that I would be redeemed as I was toiling through each chapter summary. With each copied quote, or Melville's commentary surmization, I justified everything by saying that <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> was my punishment. That <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> was the path I would take so I could take the guilt away.<br /><br />And so, when my english teacher joyously announced the "reward" all of the other perfect students would receive, I felt hopeless. Like those hours of patting myself on the back, the hours of justifying my effort, the hours of rereading, rereading, rereading Moby Dick. Just. Gone. Not there. All for nothing. Worthless.<br /><br />It felt as if Mrs. Vanhyfte tore my tongue out and threw a bucket of tar and a sack of feathers on me.<br /><br />And it just doesn't make any sense. That I should be feeling stupid, nonsense emotions like this. When this "reward" is a reward. And I'm not being punished. It's just that I didn't make the cut.<br /><br />I'm supposed to feel "normal" and everyone else is supposed to feel "extra happy". Not me feeling "extra sad" and everyone else feeling "normal".<br /><br />But, it happened like it happened. I tell myself that I try to control myself. But, I don't. Seriously. Please, stop. It's stupid to go on reading this. And writing this crap. It doesn't even make it better anymore. It used to.</s>
