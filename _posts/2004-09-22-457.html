Hey blog-thing!
<br />First, I would like to apologize since I haven't posted in such a dreadfully long while. I hope Ryo isn't mad at me. I guess school has gotten its hold on me. I've been studying non-stop it seems (at times, at least, lol) and I've been really caught up in my art project. It's taking me forever, and it's looks pretty good (from what people have told me. I think it looks weird, lol.) Anyways, I shall try to be more consistent with my posting.
<br />Now that I'm not in Honors English, things are dreadfully boring and unstimulating. I am so disappointed. Some of the people in my class can't even read well enough to get through a paragraph without taking five minutes! It's so aggravating. And then, the teacher spoils the stories because some people aren't literate enough to understand the story! GRR! It was so disappointing. We read the Cask of Armontillado (sp?) by Edgar Allen Poe and she just sits there, stops the tape (yes, we're read to by a CD like we're a bunch of stupid infants) and then tells us the ending! There was no point in finishing the story. It wasn't exciting anymore. I just about screamed.
<br />But on the good note, most of my other classes are great. Japanese is the most stimulating, and the absolute best class I have. I am the third student in three years to memorize hiragana in about a week. I was so happy. Biology is alright, except the teacher can't control the students so we get next to nothing done. I feel like I'm going to fall asleep in that class.
<br />Art is alright too, it is fun and challenging. The only downside is that a friend is getting angry at me because she feels my talent outshines hers and all this nonsense. I can't stand her anyway right now, always talking about this boy she loved but is too afraid to approach *rolls eyes* it's so annoying sometimes that I just want to scream at her.
<br />Well, let's get off the subject of school. I have soccer practice tomorrow so I might not have time to update. It all depends. Anyways, in soccer, a team mate of mine (a very ANNOYING one) always hogs the ball. We were divided into teams to scrimmage and she actually stole the ball from me just as I was about to score! She came right up and stole it, my leg met nothing, and so my knee clipped wrong. Man that hurt. Then when we were practicing corners she kept screaming 'pass it to me! Pass it to me!' when Couch told me to fire them into the middle for headers. I think the Couch sympathizes with me, Julia always aggravates me. Everything is fun until she arrives. Then she doesn't play her position, thus screwing the rest of the team up and afterwards complains that her legs hurt. Well duh! I wanted to scream, you only took over for everyone else you ball hog!
<br />Now that I've got that off of my chest, I hope she doesn't show up for a good while at tommororws practice, or I feel I might loose it and pummel her into the earth.
<br />anyways, thus is my life in only a short moments. My back is killing right now and I have to go and do my weightlifting. So, talk later!
