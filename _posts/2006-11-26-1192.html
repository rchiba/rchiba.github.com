In a nutshell, today has been a positive day. Unlike the usual sunday, where I'm sulking around thinking of the approaching schoolday, today I strided with anticipation thinking of the approaching schoolday. School: It's a feel-bad feel-good event. The duality, it's so cliche. Like something you'd read in a book.<br /><br />When there isn't any school, I feel stagnant, restless. Maybe this is what people feel like when they retire. I feel like I have to compensate, to create things, to just <span style="font-style: italic;">do </span>something, you know? If I don't make or do anything, I see no purpose in the day. At every sun set, I have to be able to say to myself, <blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"Hey, I took a step forward today."</span></blockquote>Time to work on that english essay that has been nagging me since Thursday morning (which actually means, "time to procrastinate until it's late enough for me to put if off for another day").
