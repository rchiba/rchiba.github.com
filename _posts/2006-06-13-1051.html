The first day of working at the pool was scary and embarrassing.<br /><br />Today was the second day of working at the pool, and the job seems less and less intimidating. It didn't appear to be too intimidating in the first place (official job description: sitting in a chair and doing nothing), but the whole talking-to-pool-members thing was challenging at first. Most people are friendly, but some don't like to talk. I relate to the ones that don't talk, but I'd rather have  guests of the other kind. Another difficulty I run into is breaking apart the chains of frozen sugar-water that they call "Freezer Pops" in these parts. A blue one exploded in my hand today when I nervously tried to tear it off of a chain of them. I don't know, it's either my fear of little children, or my inability to tear plastic, or a combination of both that resulted in this costly  (15 cents) failure. <br /><br />The pool attracts young children. I repel young children. The resulting relationship is not favorable for me. I think that all children hate me for some reason. I guess it's because I'm the international symbol of evil for little children, or it's because they know by instinct that I can't handle people of their age. When I say "I can't handle", I mean a number of things. First of all, I often fail to conform to their social code. Sometimes it's a matter of not walking right. Second of all, the lines of communcations are cut, slashed, burned, shredded, and smashed into the ground when I attempt to talk. Third of all, I'm not a very "fun" person. Kids like fun, right? Well, I'm not what they're looking for. <br /><br />But, they days go slower thanks to them, and me worrying about what happens to them. <br /><br />
