The deed is done.<br /><br />I have re-established my bad habit of not having a consistent sleep schedule. Being the weekend and all, I figured that I might as well sleep late.<br /><br />Bad idea. It's a bad idea because this confuses my awakening time, as I have great difficulty sleeping in the light. <br /><br />It's already 1:24AM, and to many this is relatively early for sleep. I keep telling myself that I'll go back to the days where I would go to sleep at 9PM and wake up at 4AM. If I am to ever return to those days, it will take more effort than I am putting in at the moment. <br /><br />I got my driver's license today. The lady at the counter said, "congratulations", but I really didn't feel like I accomplished anything. I could have slept for 16 years and still have gotten what I got today. It's a matter of following orders, going to a few "classes", and following more orders. So, what does this little plastic rectangle mean to me? Not much. Freedom isn't so valuable if one does not need it, does not crave it.<br /><br />It's a plastic rectangle with my face on it. It allows me to drive a big explosion-powered shell of metal that takes me places. Now what? Am I to just mindlessly drive with no purpose? If I didn't have to drive before now, I don't have to drive now. And the thing is, I won't need to drive for a few months. So, this supposedly important point in my life isn't so important anymore.<br /><br />Nothing is important anymore. Not in this sleepless stupor that I am in.
