Ok, im back to typing. I can't wait untill Justin gets back to school tommorow. I tried calling him but he was buisy. THe weekend is more boring than I thought. There is nothing at all to do. For some reason, I have an urge to burn something. I like to burn things. BURN BURN BURN! Ok, anyways, like justin, there isn't much to say for me either. Oh yea, If you want to see the cow picture go to my homepage by clicking the link at the right hand side of the page. Ok, tata;)O
