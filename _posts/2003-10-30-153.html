wow, nice update Justin. Oh yea, I am recruiting Amanda Barnett to be on the team. She meets all "Ryo Chiba" guidelines and specifications for proper recruitation  (if thats a word). I forgot her e-mail address though. Amanda, if your reading this, EMAIL ME NOW D*** IT! sorry. I need to calm down...
<br />Well, enough with that....
<br />Today I wrote some more, but not enough. I forgot my homework in foreign language so I need to remember to finish it in Band tomorow! I NEED TO REMEMBER. If I don't I am in some deep, deep, you dont want to know. Also, My whole day on Saturday is taken up by speech and lego league. I just want to stay home, but why be lazy? I only live 26000 days, better make the best of them. I am starting to write an Oppinion article in my little notepad and it should be on the articles page by sunday. Check back then to read my opinionated, biased articles. Ok, what else to discuss in my life? I need to think... Think ryo think... 
<br />Whats the use, im braindead as of now. I will report back soon though. so BYE
