Time and time again, I find myself out of time.<br /><br />And so the voyage begins and ends.<br /><br />I tell myself that I'm booked 'till eternity, but in reality, my life is empty. <br /><br />But, there are people that fill my life up with substance. It makes existing worthwhile. Going to school every day just to see those people, just for the momentary greetings, the absurd conversations, the smallest of facial gestures. <br /><br />I walk into my math classroom to see all of my peers. We have at it with small talk, giving each other common hand gesture greetings. The bell rings and the teacher gets up, starts yelling at the class to be quiet with no reaction, tries again, and eventually succeeds. And so we go over some old-news, easy math concept from ages ago that we all know. Behind me, a friend makes a witty remark on the difficulty of the material. I quickly turn around, shoot a quick grin at him, and in return he shoots a smirk right back at me. We continue with our lesson, and the rest of the day fades away in my memory.<br /><br />Those moments where a common bond is established among peers are so contenting, are so satisfactory, and complete me as a person. I live for the wink and the grin. I live for the smile and the talk. The little things, like how someone walks, the way someone's hand flips a page to a book. The arcs in which such movement is achieved. The tiny, miniscule things that turn humans into people never cease to catch my attention. <br /><br />Serious topics are so bothersome. Talking about religion, or politics, or economics is so frustrating. These things break friendships, and create conflicts. And it happens too often for my tastes. Everyone thinks they're right, and everyone enjoys partaking in vicious arguments. I used to partake in such things, and I'm afraid to say that I still do at times. But, now I attempt to control myself or ignore such conversations. Over the years, I've realized my own ignorance, and because of this, I've come to understand that I'm exactly like everybody else, in the sense that a resolution will never be achieved with bickering. <br /><br />The teacher ends the lesson, and the class gets the assignment. Same old day, same old math. We all get done in a matter of minutes. And soon, the air gets stale. As I stare at the clock, waiting for time to pass me by, I overhear a heated argument over some religious belief. And so I turn around to see my friend quibbling, and in his eyes is the primal urge to voice his opinion. I turn back around and stare at the clock. Tick, tick...<br /><br />Waiting for it all to end.<br /><br />I believe that if everyone took the time to sit down, look around, and realize how enjoyable people really are as individuals, and not fuss over ethereal things such as ethics or morality, we, as a society, would be in better standing.
