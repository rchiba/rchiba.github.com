My mind is hazy. A thick fog, so thick that if you swished your hand through it, on your hand would be little droplets of water. It's not a light haze. Tired. I felt sick this morning. That usually happens when I don't get enough sleep. The duration and severity of my illness is directly related to how little I slept the night before.<br /><br />I walked into school with an uncomfortable stomach. I have so many memories of feeling like this in French class. I've had French class in the morning too many times for my liking. The class is like a light switch. It's either really taxing, or "story time". On or off. Opening the door and collapsing into class, I hoped that I would get better soon.<br /><br />Luckily, I did. By second period, fifty minutes later, I felt better. Apparently, my sleep debt isn't too big. I might be able to catch up this coming weekend.<br /><br />Why do I say that? I know that I sleep less on the weekend by default. False hope, anybody?<br /><br />I should stop thinking about my newspaper articles. I have this anxiety. My journalism teacher makes me nervous. Just like I described the articles, she's overwhelming. <br /><br />Or maybe it's the topics I'm writing about. For the first three newspaper articles due next week, I'm doing two on gaming. I was never much of a gamer. I just put the article ideas on the brainstorming board, and they never came down, so my name got slapped on them and now they're my problem. I stopped being up to date on games a month or two after the last generation of consoles (GC, Xbox, PS2) came out. Maybe a few months earlier or later. If you're really curious, why don't you check out my archives?<br /><br />Tiffany got frustrated on her Physics homework, and I walked away from her to get information for a possible interview for one of my articles. I realized my mistake when a few people from the table brought the matter to my attention. <br /><br />I felt guilty the whole rest of the day. Couldn't stop thinking,<br /><br /><i>"I don't deserve her. Can't understand. Why does she like stupid, pathetic me? They're so many people better than me. I just don't deserve her."</i><br /><br />I couldn't even express my genuine apology to her. I'm just... everything that touches me, every word that comes out of my mouth, every sentence I write, every vocabulary term I learn, seems to just wither and die. The person who I wanted to interview gave me a <i>fake phone number</i>. I guess I can't even <i>interview</i> people for my <b>fucking</b> articles. I made a mistake, and then a mistake within the mistake, and then a few mistakes trying to correct the first mistake.<br /><br />Everything is so hazy. Just have to make it to tomorrow, then to Friday.
