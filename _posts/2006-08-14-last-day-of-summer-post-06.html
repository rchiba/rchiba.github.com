<b>The events in this entry happened on July 14, 2006. <a href="http://ryochiba.blogspot.com/2006/07/i-awoke-from-nap-hour-ago-and-didnt.html#comments" target="_blank">[LINK]</a></b><br /><br />The sky is speckled. Blue, a brilliant blue, with white clouds floating along whimsically. Temperature: hot. I drive down US Highway 52, and my mind is buzzing, my fingers tapping. My breath is quickening and my heart is pounding. As I type this, my heart still is. The oldies music streaming from the radio speaks wantonly of love. <i>Billy Joel, The Beatles, The Jackson Five.</i> I wonder if they're missing something, or if I am. I've been listening to these songs for my whole life. The notes, shrill twitters, and the booming thuds, they have never had any particular meaning to me. But, now they're different. Can't quite grasp what is different about them.  The speedometer reads 45mph. The sign says 55.<br /><br /><i>"Better hurry up. No point in dragging it out."</i>, I tell myself.<br /><br />I'm excited. I approach the last stoplight from your house. As I make a hasty left turn, I ask myself,<br /><br /><i>"What am I doing here?"</i><br /><br />I'm i front of your house five minutes later. I can only think,<br /><br /><i>"Is this really happening?"</i><br /><br />The answer to my own pointless question is answered when you walk out of your door. Your purse jingles at your side. The black fabric and faded red emblem are washed out by the sun as you step into my car.<br /><br />Instantly, I attempt to justify and quell my jitters by fussing over fictional odd noises in the trunk of the car. Before leaving, we both walk to the back of the silver Honda Accord, the rocky gravel crunching under our feet. The simple sounds of arguing birds fills the air.<br /><br />I open the trunk to find a large bin of spilled tennis balls. We both laugh a little. But, while our nervous chuckles continue, I'm thinking and trying desperately to figure out if you suspect anything. <br /><br />We put the tennis balls back into the red and white plastic bin. With a klunk and a rattle, the trunk is closed and the engine is started. The sharp, orange needles spin to life in the dashboard. The radio kicks on. I pull out of your neighborhood and look back up to the majestic sky, admiring the towering supercell miles away. Rain. It'll come soon. I bring my eyes back to the road and try to focus on driving. It's to hard to do this. My heart choked with <i>something</i>, the air choked with your sweet smell, your wonderful voice talking, all these things set in motion both the parallel secret and unsecret plan. The mood is established.<br /><br />We chat over gas prices while the radio continues to provide background noise. Sometimes static, sometimes song. In the car, it really doesn't matter.  We manage to navigate the winding streets between your house and our destination. I try to show my safety by actually stopping at lights when they turn yellow. It doesn't impress you much, and justifiably so. Then, we start talking about your driving skills.<br /><br />Sparkling flies, as the world always seems in these moments, bash onto the side-view mirrors of the car, releasing their organs from the oppressive shell that held them. The wind pushes the lifeless carcasses up and away from the car. Only the penny-sized brown splatters remain. Flies are simple creatures. I imagine what the fly would have thought about the loss of its future. Its crushed hopes and dreams, its energetic past, from the egg to the hard plastic of the car, its ambitions. What would the fly have done if it lived?    <br /><br />In my nervousness, I take a right, going the wrong way on a one-way street. We are downtown. There are loads of cars and the streets are very tight. Visibility is limited. I'm driving into oncoming traffic. The odds are against me. <br /><br />A few tense seconds pass after I see that the line on the road is white and that the cars parked to the side are pointed toward me. With luck, I find an alleyway to the right. It leads to another road across the block. Constricting the alley are large brick walls,  leaving barely enough room to squeeze a car through. Inside the car, we're having a great, loud fuss over the incident. Laughing, yelling. My smile is genuine.<br /><br />We eventually end up parking in front of the library. We open the car doors and step out. I love the sound of closing car doors. Thunk. I tell you of the various disguises I have in my bag to be used in case my parents walk in on our meeting. Each block feels like a minefield. So many things that could go wrong, can't let this opportunity fall apart because of a stupid mistake, or a stupid accident. The concrete rectangles guide me along. Slowly, surely, and nervously, we make our way toward the coffee shop.<br /><br />Nearing our destination, I see a bunch of smoking teens, each with their intimidating stance and equally intimidating clothing accessory. Wind filters through my fingers as I try to rush past them. Gotta' keep myself from making eye contact. But, you trail behind me. Looking back at this, I have to ask myself,<br /><br /><i>"What am I so afraid of?"</i><br /><br />We walk into the building that can be described only by a long string of adjectives. It's a humble, dark, empty, fragrant, relaxed, mellow, brown establishment.You get a small Sprite, and I get  small iced tea. The lady at the counter gives us our beverages in large styrofoam cups, and we pay our two dollars. I feel a little guilty for not paying for you, but I figure I'll have plenty of opportunities to be chivalrous later.<br /><br />The stairs lead us to the second floor, to the chess tables. I remind myself that I don't know if you suspect anything or not. As I set up the chess tables, I move the chess board around. My reasons?<br /><br />"<i>I'm getting bad vibes from this one</i>", I say.<br /><br />I mean, the table I pick is going to be significant. The table I choose is the table where I confess two years of stored up feelings. This is going to be <i>the</i> table. But, I end up choosing the one with the working lamp. A choice made from practicality. <br /><br />We start playing chess, and it's a good game. We sip our drinks, and I ponder as to when the most advantageous time to tell you would be. I figure that if I tell you when I'm losing, I can disrupt your playing, and judge your reaction from looking at how you move your pieces. Unfortunately, I win the game without this opportune moment. <br /><br />Desperate to tell you, I ask you for another game, and consequently another chance to let my secret out. <br /><br />You glance down at your watch and I start to feel nervous. <i>What if you have to get home soon? What if I'm not able to tell you?</i><br /><br />Every Friday night, the coffee shop has a live band come in to play for a few hours. It happens to be a Friday night, and the band walks through the door. They plug their worn instruments into the jumbled stack of amps and other sound equipment. <i>"Check, check, check"</i>, one says as the others tune their guitars. <br /><br />You look up from your watch and, somehow sensing the direction of my plot, accept my request to play another game. A little bit of relief sets in, but it's not enough to keep me from showing signs of nervousness. I set up the board with my shaking hands, some of the pieces fall over. My mind is racing for words. I find them at the end of the game.<br /><br />As I sweep my remaining arm off of the monochrome battlefield, I say,<br /><br /><i>"To tell you the truth, a big reason why I invited you here today was so that I could tell you that I love you."</i><br /><br />Your eyes start to water and become reflective in the yellow lamplight. Uneasily and anxiously, not really knowing what to fill the dead airspace with, I  bluntly state,<br /><br /><i>"Now I guess I have to judge your reaction."</i><br /><br />Your eyes lock onto mine for a second or two. They search as if they are probing within me. They search, trying to see into what I'm really feeling. Your eyes, <i>do they see my feelings?</i><br /><br />You smile. I feel like fainting. You say, <i>"I like you too."</i><br /><br />And so it ends there. For the next few seconds after your reply, I feel dizzy, euphoric, but more dizzy. <i>I can't believe it really happened. Just as planned.</i> We talk about petty things afterwards. I go to the bathroom and as I walk out and greet you, I feel something new between us. It was in your eyes, must've been in mine too. Something, something was there to make me feel cared about. <br /><br />Our walk to the car is filled with an awkward sort of conversation. We're both not used to this. I stutter and mutter, kicking around my words trying to get them out of my mouth intact. You laugh and talk fast.<br /><br />We make it to the car, sitting in the seats as a closer pair than as we left. On the way back to your house, we both talk about our relationship status. Right then and there, we decide that it's time to label ourselves as a couple, and that we should lay down some preliminary guidelines. <i>No kissing, yet. We should take it slow, yes. We're exclusive to each other now, no cheating. Absolutely, yes.</i><br /><br />My hopes, dreams, the very system I have lived for. These things are affirmed now that we are a pair. The world comes together and my love becomes a justified affair. I drop you off and we are slightly changed people. <br /><br />As you walk into your door, you turn around and wave goodbye to me. My head rushes with emotion. I get the urge to hold you in my arms and kiss you. But, I know there's a time for that, and we're both not ready for that time to be. It's an odd thing, it's a raw thing. Powerless I am in this complicated emotion, yet it somehow empowers me.<br /><br />The sun goes down, and the sky is no longer speckled. Purple clouds meld together in a broth of darkness. Another great day ends.
