When I woke up this morning, I wondered what all the nonsense the day before was about. How could I feel so much better in a matter of a few hours? <br /><br />But, I'm afriad that if I don't get more sleep, then the illness will come back to haunt me. It's already past the time that I agreed with myself that I would go to sleep at. I'm just making last minute preparations for tomorrow's robotics meeting, which will hopefully run smoothly.<br /><br />I feel very busy!
