Tomorrow is the "Harrison Invitational" which is just a practice for the divers for sectionals. I'm nervous, because I'll be doing a back 1.5 dive. I haven't been able to kick out of it hardly.<br /><br />Today, I went to a party at Greg's house for the divers. It was fantastic. I got to play Greg in "Super Smash Brothers Melee" and we were about at the same skill level.<br /><br />Can you believe it that diving ends this weekend?! I'm going to be so relieved. I can't even describe the relief I will feel. It's just going to be so... Overwhelming...<br /><br />Anyways, I learned calculus in QuizBowl today. The only thing, I know how to derive a derivitave, but what ARE they?<br /><br />Also, Zach is wishing death upon people, but he says he is Catholic. Does this make any sense? Isn't wishing death against god or something? How can he call himself religious if he's so violent?
