There is not much to write about here on winter vacation. The LOTR thing was ok, a bit sub-par ending. I expected more. It dragged on and on for 3 and a half HOURS!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I just realized that winter vactation lasted another WEEK! I thought I would have to go to school tomorow. I don't know how to take it, good or bad. I haven't worked on my story, but I just thought up of something. Anyways, I accidentally ripped part of the brand new computer chair and I am planning to go to Lowes to get that vynal ( I have no clue how to spell it) repair gel stuff. I need to fix it before the rip gets larger. Oh yea, I just now realized that my story was on the other computer and it was lost when it crashed. Oh darn! I'm never going to recover that information because the hard drive is dead as a mad cow. I heard that Japan's crime rate is getting pretty high. A bad sign I suppose...
