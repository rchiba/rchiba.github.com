Hello, due to time restrictions, I am unable to type much at the time. I have to practice my clarinet, and of course, find the nearest NPR radio station and listen to it while reading the latest "Time" magazine, while in my bed. Not that this blog is of lower importance. I just feel as though the most logical choice is to do more of the other than this. I took notes today, of what went on today, so I could write alot, but I suppose that I will do this tomorow. I hope I have more time tomorow, but it seems not, for many teachers are starting on the hardest chapters tomorow. 
<br />
<br />I just want to comment about how my French teacher incessently sings "Love Potion #9". It's so catchy, I can't get it out of my head now. Along with her extensive plunger collection, this makes her one of those teachers who are very good at teaching, but also very interesting to watch. 
<br />
<br />Adam is finishing my story in English, so kudos to him and his valiant efforts. Hopefully, he'll do the work, but I trust him.
<br />
<br />Another kudos goes to Juan, who lended me his French book in a time of need. He deserves a thanks because he is a nice person (On the outside at least).
<br />
<br />And finally, another kudos to my 8th grade math teacher, because I feel like giving him a thanks, just because.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have alot to do and relax and study and, etc. I have so much to write, but not enough time. I shall try to overcome these challenges tomorow to write more. Also, I hope Ryan comes back soon. It's getting lonely on the bus. Bye!
