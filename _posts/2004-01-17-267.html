This is average yo here,
<br />Today was my mom's birthday. I will not reveal her birthday. Anyways, we wen't to Indianapolis for the mall and looked around there. At the mall, there was this apple computer store and the computers on it had the internet. From the "Power Mac G5" in the store, I signed my guestbook. Pretty nifty huh? Anyways, all that walking in the mall wore me out. I was just surfing the blogs on blogger and I found a link to this site called "terra server". It is so very nifty. It has a huge arial map of the united states, canada, alaska, and hawaii. You can zoom in so much that you can see your house. All you have to do is type in your adress. I also found my school, which was also nifty. Some of the arial pics are old, so if you have a new house, it might still just be a foundation. I really like it. I recommend you play with it also. Anyways, after the mall, we went to this posh steakhouse place for lunch. It was a good deal, for all the food and service. $6.00 for a club sandwhich (IT WAS HUGE, BY THE WAY). It seemsed sophisticated. Only we were there though. It seemed odd to see an empty expensive restaurant.

<br />I've revised my speech, but it doesn't sound good yet. I found a focus though. I sent it to Mr. Rice. I hope he can schedule it sometime soon. I really want to do good in it, seeing how bad I do at mathcounts (I still feel like a complete failure). I need to boost my confidence somehow...
<br />
<br />Anyways, it's late at night and i'm feeling sluggish. I should get to sleep. But I can't because there's a feeling in me that I forgot to say something on this website. I wonder what it is. I wish I could remember. The only thing on my mind right now is high school. It's like a lion. Tame it, or be eaten. I just hope that I don't hit burnout. It seems as though Amanda needs my help (makes me feel a bit more confident) so, I would tell her, if she were reading this, to email me. I hope I don't get eaten...
