I recently got the "T-zones" service for my cell phone which enables it to surf WAP internet sites. It's nice that it only costs $5.<br /><br />Anyways, my biology cramming really helped me today. When I took the test, the knowledge was there. Cramming must not be all that bad. I mean, people are always like, "Cramming is bad. You have to learn to study a month before a test." The message should be, "Cramming works. Cram."<br /><br />By the way, I burned another CD today called "Old Stuff that's Kinda New (not really)." I like it.<br /><br />Also, I was alarmed by a book that my little sister brought home. One of its questions was, "How has the freedom of speech enabled peace flourish?" People can valiantly argue about how the freedom of speech promotes peace, but the thing is, true peace cannot be incurred by freedoms and democracy. Freedom of speech always means someone ranting, complaining, and threatening. Freedom of speech means freedom of conflict. Now, is that peace? <br /><br />I'm still amazed at the uneducated people in the world today (me being one of them.) I hate selfish, arrogant, and uneducated people. People like those crumbby 96.5 WAZY radio station Disk Jockeys. They were talking about how rising fuel prices were biting into their wallets. Well, stupid idiots, the world isn't revolving around you. Other countries have been paying twice to three times the ammount of us Americans. You are paying more because you continue to use. Hey, here's an idea for you savage disk jockeys. Maybe you should drive a Prius, jerk. WAZY has just earned themselves a disgruntled listeners. Perhaps I should pay them a nice little visit...<br /><br />Ugh, true disgust.
