Hey there blog-thing! It's been a while, ya know? ^_^ For once, on a weekend, I'm actually, dare I say it.... happy!!!! Of course, it's not for what you are thinking. My parents have probably passed out downstais, so no, they didn't miraculously stop drinking so I could quite worrying about their livers and stuff. And no, my little sister didn't miraculously find a cure for hyperactivity, in fact, she's snoring on the couch. -___- you'd think SHE'S the one with a hangover...
<br />But no! nothing you're probably thinking of! The real thing that has made me so joyful? I FINISHED PART TWO! Hurray! Everyone do the crazy, demented, monkey dance of DOOM! Lol! Not really, I wouldn't want y'all to hurt yourselves, but I did finish part two! I think Ryo will like chapter 11. It's the elfin battle scene where heads go flying and bodies are mutilated beyond recognition. It's funny.... to the officially morbid humored people like me. Lol. 
<br />Also, this weekend, I got hyper! LOL XD Yes, me, the old stick in the mud (or as Charlene likes to say, that when I get in my 'moods' I'm a  "fun sucker"...) finally went out into the fresh air! I SEE THE LIIIIIGHT! I didn't stay in my hole all weekend like I usually do. I ran, I played, and then when it was getting good....Mom ruined it -____- She called us lazy (She was drunk of course) and started harpin all over Charlene and me. So I got ticked off, did the work and then confronted her. She was so wasted she couldn't even remember calling us lazy, which ticked me off even more.
<br />Oi vey...
<br />Anyways, my life, sorta. Talk later. buh-bye ^^
<br />~Amanda
