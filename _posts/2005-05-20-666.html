You can tell a lot about a person by studying how he or she commutes by stair.<br /><br />I often observe the motions people go through while climbing or descending stairs. I mean, what else are you going to do while you yourself are traversing the stairs? I've even studied myself.<br /><br />I usually quickly scurry down the stairs with the middle of my foot balancing on the edge of the stair. I suppose I like to get to places on time, so I use this fast, but albeit risky method. This is not the case if my shoes are untied. If they are untied, I usually proceed very carefully. I put the ball of my foot slowly down so that it touches the stair at just the right angle as to not catch my shoelace. Then, I lower my foot so all of it touches the stair and make sure the shoelace has not caught under the shoe. I then repeat these steps with the other foot and so and so forth. When I walk up the stairs, I usually struggle. Many times, I talk with friends and stumble. I can often muster up the strength to climb the stairs at quite a rapid rate, but I usually go moderately fast.<br /><br />I watched someone climbing the stairs this morning. He walked slowly and boldly. The stairs seemed to be just another obstacle to him. He raised his foot to the third stair as he started his ascent. Next, he slammed his sole on the stair as if to claim superiority. All points of the flat sole contacted the stair at the same time, making a slapping noise. These steps were repeated until the second floor was reached.<br /><br />I watched another person climbing the stairs this morning. He was carelessly swooning on the stairs like a drunk elephant. This is when his friend came. They started chatting, mocking each other, and finally arguing. The friend pushed this guy down the stairs. 'Nuf said.<br /><br />Obviously, stair climbing can be revealing. So the moral? Use stairs carefully. First impressions are important.
