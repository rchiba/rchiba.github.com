It's a quaint October morning as we cruise down a country road to a little town called Frankfort.<br /><br />My mother and I are driving to the public library there so I can take the technician's amateur radio exam. I'm voraciously studying questions from a book.<br /><br />We hit a bump, and I look up. Big American trucks and old farmhouses whiz past my window as I peer out into, what seems like, a completely peaceful world. The trees sway in the wind, the leaves fall into small man-made lakes. An old, rusty windmill juts out of the ground. <br /><br />I begin to notice an increased number of antennas in the country. Each abandoned farmhouse appears to be attached to some kind of giant antenna tower, with a yagi and television antenna. Most of these towers are bent, rusted, and falling apart. But, every few miles or so were new antennas. Antennas for cellular companies and FM radio broadcasts. If you look carefully, it's quite a challenge to find an area that doesn't have metal clips that jut into the air. <br /><br />Our arrival to Frankfort is signified by giant, dilapidated storage silos for who know's what. The metal luster is long gone, the sheen worn off by the elements. Only shells of what they once were, these vacated grain mills cluster the landscape as we approach the little town of Frankfort.<br /><br />The inner city of Frankfort consists of old churches and deplorable car lots, with the occasional pharmacy or dollar store. The roads are empty, and the only thing that seems to thrive here is the cold wind. Houses in this town can be lumped into two general categories. One of them being "urban, ghetto houses" and the other being "old trailer houses". <br /><br />The library appears. It sticks out like a sore thumb. Although it is not an eyesore in itself, it contrasts with the cracked sidewalk and old trees. The modern-esque, new building looks like it was dropped here from the sky by some higher being (Which I assume is really some kind of artsy-fartsy modern architect). <br /><br />Old, run-down houses and old groceries surround the library. The sky is gray, and the air is crisp. Crisp enough to be uncomfortable. I zip up my coat and walk to the door, and it opens by itself with a ker-klunk. The rest of the town is eerily silent.<br /><br />I enter, and I see no one. I begin to doubt the validity of the "Open" sign that was on the door behind me. I glance around, and catch a glimpse of some stairs. Why not?<br /><br />I climb the stairs and take a left. In the hallway, I see someone walking. Slowly, I follow the man until I'm greeted by two old men. The kind of old men that probably lived through the depression. A warm smile appeared on their faces. <br /><br />They motion to a room in the back, a small door no larger than a bookshelf with a little paper sign on it. <br /><br />"VE Testing", it says.<br /><br />I find myself hesitant, but I manage to take a breath, summon up some courage, and walk in. <br /><br />I find a old, rustic table and a few chairs. Two other men are sitting at the table, taking the test. three very old men sit at another table. I assume that they are the Volunteer Examiners and that they are probably in their 70's. The men at the testing table look 30-ish. One of the testing men is wearing dark, hunting boots and a camo jacket. The other is wearing big sunglasses. The men at the table shuffle their papers, and I stand there. Pausing for a bit to let it all soak in. I stick out.<br /><br />I walk to the table and hand one of the men my $14 to take the test. He hands me a form, a test, and a pencil. I sit down and take the test. This is the easy part.<br /><br />The questions whiz past, everything on the test just as I had immagined. After tripple-checking my answers, I walk up to the desk.<br /><br />I realize that I forgot to write down my FCC CORES number down on the form. I take out my number out of my pocket and scribble it on the form. I mumble to the old men that I forgot to write down this number. One of them is hard of hearing, so I tell him again, louder. He nods, but I don't think he understands. Nonetheless, I hand them my papers and sit down. They grade.<br /><br />After a few minutes, one of the old men walks up to me and puts a piece of paper on the table. I look up. He smiles.<br /><br />He points to a spot that is marked "Applicant Signature-->". I sign it.<br /><br />"So, this is it?", I say.<br /><br />The old man says, "Welcome" and puts out his hand for me to shake. I fluster for a bit, surprised by this offer. Coming to my senses, I shake his hand. It should be noted that I shook it firmly, as I have practiced effective hand shaking at QuizBowl.<br /><br />I start to walk out the door. Out of the corner of my eye, the other two old men at the table stand up. <br /><br />I think to myself, "Something must be wrong. Maybe I failed the test. Perhaps they graded something incorrectly."<br /><br />Turning around to see what the movement is about, the two old men put out there hands for me to shake. Again, I'm surprised, but manage to shake both of their hands. The last old man to shake my hand looks me in the eye and says, "Good luck".<br /><br />I look back at him in the eyes for a fraction of a second, and even though his worn face is stuck in a firm, stern expression, I caught the slightest hint of acceptance in his eyes. <br /><br />I muster a weak "Thanks" and walk out the door with my certificate and hopes for a license arriving in the mail in a month or so.<br /><br />I walked out the door with something else too. <br /><br />A feeling of acceptance.
