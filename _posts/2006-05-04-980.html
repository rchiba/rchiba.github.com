<b>Act, v.</b><br /><ul><li><i>1.To behave in a certain manner; show a certain behavior; conduct or comport oneself; "You should act like an adult"; "Don't behave like a fool"; "What makes her do this way?"; "The dog acts ferocious, but he is really afraid of people" </li><br /><li></li><br /><li>2.To play a role or part; "Gielgud played Hamlet"; "She wants to act Lady Macbeth, but she is too young for the role"; "She played the servant to her husband's master"</i></li></ul><br /><br />I was flipping through a week-old <i>Time</i> magazine, and was reading an article about the 100 best high schools in America. In it, there was a short segment on the validity of the gender-segregated schooling argument. In it, a male high school student was quoted in saying, <i>"If there were girls in this class, I'm sure that some of us would act differently. Personally, I would act the same."</i><br /><br />And it made me wonder about how who the people around me really are, and who I <b>really</b> am. I read that quote and asked myself if I would act differently depending on certain circumstances in my environment. My answer is simple. Of course I would act differently. This is demonstrated in the great change in mood and actions between Health class and Chemistry class. <br /><br />In health, I don't know anyone in the class. I regard the peers that surround me in that class to be immature and bothersome. I sit next to two frustratingly loud, mentally handicapped people. The curriculum taught in that class is absurdly easy. The videos that we watch are sponsored by companies that provide our class with biased information. For example, our class learned about hydration with a video sponsored by Gatorade. So now the class thinks that Gatorade is the only choice for proper hydration. Things like this frustrate me. I try to control this anger by sleeping in the class. People in the class probably think I'm weird or socially unacceptable. I walk out of the class drowsy from the short microsleep that I get in the class, sickened by the atmosphere of the class. <br /><br />Things change in Chemistry. In this class, I'm surrounded by people who I can carry intelligent conversations with. Humor and wit are exciting spices that add to the general flavor of the conversational staples such as current events, politics, science, and philosophical questions. The curriculum moves at a decent pace, and the things covered are interesting and new. As a result, I am constantly excited, talking, mobile, actively listening and responding, mentally sharp, and happy. I have no need to sleep to cover up my true feelings.<br /><br />But, do I have any more emotions, or parts of my personality that I cover up, even in the comfort of Chemistry class? And the age old question seems to tie this nonsense together.<br /><br /><b>Who am I?</b><br /><br />Life must be one big act. Impossible to know who other people really are, impossible to even know one's own being.
