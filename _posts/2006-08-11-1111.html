Life has become very confusing.<br /><br />I don't know what to write in each item I write every night. I wrote a detailed description of what happened at the movie theater with Tiffany, Heather, and DJ in my personal journal. I wrote an email to Tiffany about how I feel sad right now. Only so many things happen in one day, so figuring out what to put in each text pipeline is a challenge.<br /><br />My eyes hurt. I'm afraid of sleeping, but I'm getting more tired every day.<br /><br />I had a nightmare about school last night, that's why I'm afraid of sleeping. These nightmares are common during nights before the start of school. I'm expecting to have one tonight. They're horrible. Always, there is death, anxiety, depression, confusion. In these dreams, I can hardly describe in words how terrifying they are. I wake up just as a giant concrete slab is crushing me, just as a bomb tears me to shreds, just as a knife cuts into me, just as I die. And all I think when I wake up is, <i>"I don't want to die."</i><br /><br />I'm all wound up. I hate these nights before school. Nausea. Stress. Frustration. It's either one or the others. I don't know what to do to help me cope. Typing helps. Sleeping would, if I wouldn't get these nightmares.<br /><br />I was intrigued when I read the entry under the "Cognitive Aspects" of the article on "Social Anxiety" on Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety" target="_blank">[LINK]</a><br /><br /><b>Cognitive Aspects</b><br />"<i>In cognitive models of social anxiety, social phobics experience dread over how they will be presented to others. They may be overly self-conscious, pay high self-attention after the activity, or have high performance standards for themselves. According to the social psychology theory, self-presentation, a sufferer attempts to create a well-mannered impression on others but believes he or she is unable to do so. Many times, prior to the potentially anxiety-provoking social situation, sufferers may deliberate over what could go wrong and how to deal with each unexpected case. After the event, they may have the perception they performed unsatisfactorily. Consequently, they will review anything that may have possibly been abnormal or embarrassing. These thoughts do not just terminate soon after the encounter, but may extend for weeks or longer. Those with social phobia tend to interpret neutral or ambiguous conversations with a negative outlook and although still inconclusive, some studies suggest that socially anxious individuals remember more negative memories than those less distressed.</i>"<br /><br />I can relate.<br /><br />
