My "to-do" list for the weekend:<br /><br />1) Get some sleep. (This goal is going to be the most difficult)<br />2) Get more art up.<br />3) Start the Robotics animation modeling.<br />4) Finish homework.<br />5) Study for tests.<br /><br />Blah. I really don't think I'll get them all done. Since goal number five is the most important, I really should be focused on that the most. I've got three hard "I've been waiting two months reviewing in class" tests that are going to include lots of knowledge. I hope to regain this lost knowledge this weekend so I can get good grades on the tests.<br /><br />In other news, I'm a raving lunatic that lacks the capacity to come up with text. It's a few minutes before midnight, and I'm telling myself that I'm supposed to be tired, but I'm jazzed. My mind is blank, but my body can't stop moving around and fidgeting. I guess this is what happens to individuals that are subjected to stress, excitement, and mundane routine all at the same time.
