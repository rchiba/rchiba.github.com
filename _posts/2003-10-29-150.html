It is yet again getting closer. closer. and closer to school. I am anxious to get there so I can get it over with. I really should use a notepad. I'm going to find one after this typage session. Oh yea, I added a text board on the right hand side of the screen. All you have to do is enter your screen name and/or email address, and then type in a message. It's great fun really, so TRY IT OUT. Ok, thats all.

<br />Now...
<br />to find my notepad...
