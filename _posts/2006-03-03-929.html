Went to the "Occupational Medicine" building today for a routine health exam. Not really routine, persay. The exam is to get green card status for the US. It's kind of a big deal...<br /><br />Routine exam, nothing new, besides collecting a blood sample for the first time in my life. Having sat in a cheap plastic chair in the blood lab, I found the blood collection unit fascinating. It was even more fascinating once the needle was inserted into my skin and my blood started collecting in the plastic capsule. To think that my very own life-essential liquid was flowing out of my system and into a container seems to me very interesting. Some people detest needles and blood. I guess I'm not one of those people.<br /><br />The nurse asked me if I wanted to be a doctor like my father. As time goes on, the question of my future continues to loom above me, growing larger every day. It seems that nurses and the like always ask you questions like that as procedural small-talk. Although I understand that such an open-ended question is a good choice for distracting the patient, the content of the question itself bothers me a little bit. Not the fact that the nurse asked me, but the fact that the question needs to be answered soon.<br /><br />My future is a mystery.<br /><br />And supposedly, mysterious people have sex appeal.<br /><br />Just fantastic.
