Hard drive corruption and reinstallation of an operating system is both a good thing and a bad thing. Just like the repopulation of the human race is a good thign and a bad thing. Overpopulation results in poor living conditions and a failure-prone society, while the production of humans results in a viable future for our species. Thusly, I wasn't very stressed out today when the slowly dying, wheezing, sputtering old hard drive became too corrupted and unstable to hold up an operating system. Luckily, a fresh hard drive is inside to replace it, and a fresh installation of Windows has been accomplished. The (very many) essential programs have been downloaded from the Internet, and now I can get to work on things. Opening windows and menus and such are much faster now that the computer has been cleaned of all the scatter that previously held it hostage. It's a wonderful thing.<br /><br />I had someone tell me about how they wanted to become a valedictorian and get the best grades. The person seemed to be caught up in a conundrum of academic nonsense. And for a moment I became confused. And the moment didn't go away. It's still here. It confuses me how people becomes so involved in getting the best grades and the best title, but what's the point if you're not enjoying life? I manage to get A's, but I try not to let my grades immerse me in a bona fide battle against myself. (Notice how I say "try"). To me, being valedictorian isn't worth it if I have to sacrifice my contentness, satisfaction of living my own life. The person I was talking to mentioned that valedictorian means fast track to money. Not always true, my friend. *Who* you are will get you farther than mere numbers on a sheet of paper with your name on it. *Who* you are defines the purpose of your existance. <br /><br />I'm sure there are others out there who will disagree with my thoughts, but I'm fine with being labeled as an imbecile and laughed at. Actually, I really wouldn't be fine with that, but if it happens, it happens. "Character through hardships" is the motto of the week, folks.<br /><br />Now it's off to organize stacks of robotics papers and browse through old webcomics.
