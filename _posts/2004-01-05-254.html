I haven't been updating because my dad has been on the internet 2 days in a row fixing the black computer. NOW IT RUNS! Anyways, right after he fixed it, we got the Blaster Virus. How unlucky is that? Well, all software on our computer is gone, all documents, everything. My dad's been downloading tons of stuff from the internet and I couldn't get to updating my blog. I am now on the black computer and it is so much better than the old one.

<br />Tomorow is the day that school starts. I can't wait, yet I don't want to go. I like having a set schedule, but I hate homework. I shouldn't be complaining. This middle school has hardly any homework compared to some OTHER schools I know. I mean, homework is hardly existant sometimes. Anyways, I have to do a speech on my grandma. I timed it and I was just under 2 minuites. My mom got me the general information, but "nitty gritty" details are unfortunately out of my grasp. Today is my one shot at practicing it and here I am, typing on a computer.

<br />Anyways, there has been a flood warning around the place I live. I saw the creek and it was pretty high. The thick, brown water penetrated this one persons lawn. I'm afraid to type things because my parents know about my site now. I guess I could encrypt it and change the adress or something, but I am too lazy. I wish my parents didn't know about this site. They could be reading it right now.

<br />Sometimes I get angry and I don't know why. If I have too many things to do, I get angry. When I can't do those things, I get even angrier. I have to take this ACT test at the local high school sometime this month. I am angry, but will get angrier if it gets canceled. I am very oxy-moronic. I have so much to type about, but I am getting angry. If my parents read this, maybe they would take me to a mental institution, and that WOULD NOT BE GOOD.

<br />Bye ;(
