I don't like mood swings. I don't like myself.<br /><br />I'm not going to rant on about how or why I felt bad after school. You don't want to hear it, I don't want to hear it. It's stupid. I'm over it.<br /><br />But, what happened was I was walking out of school, walking to my van. Andrew and Rachel notice that I'm distressed. <i>They try to help me</i>. I throw my keys in the air and sulk away. <i>They try to help me.</i> I get in my van and turn the ignition. The engine starts to hum. Rachel refuses to shut the door. <i>She's trying to help me</i>. I floor it. Rachel hangs on to the door. <i>She's trying to help me</i>. I'm hitting 35mph in the parking lot, heading toward a chainlink fence. Too fast. I'm being irrational. I slow down and Rachel finally gets off. She was trying to help me. I drive away angry, sad, then ashamed. <br /><br />And they were just trying to help me. They're great people, great friends, <i>people who actually care</i>, people I admire and want to someday live up to. And what do I do in return? I'm angry, sad, stupid, and irrational. I do something very dangerous, putting her at risk because of my feelings that have nothing to do with her. I hate myself for it.<br /><br />I've got to look back on this and change. I'll never get anywhere if I don't.
