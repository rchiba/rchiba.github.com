I still feel like a flogged moose tied to a long tree. In other words, I'm still just as groggy and tired as yesterday. My illness seems to want to stay with me.<br /><br />I have witnessed yet another example of how propanganda in popular media can create a dull-witted generation. My example today is, "Shark Tales." You know that movie, that movie that stirred up the hullaballoo with those crazy little kids and afterward ended up being a forgotten disk hidden away in the dusty corner of a closet. Yes, that movie.<br /><br />Well, no one cares about the story, so I'll skip that part. In the end, the sharks and the fish become friends after a vegetarian shark and a poserlicous fish win over the hearts of everyone. Then the party ensues. The party is not the important part, but just another aspect of a inefficient society. Keep that in mind. Actually, you don't have to. Many people can hardy keep what they ate for breakfast in their mind, nonetheless an unorthodox concept.<br /><br />Well, this movie doesn't explain what would happen afterwards. The sharks would starve. At the same time, the fish population would multiply to an unmaintainable limit. This would lead to the collapse of the ecosystem, the systematical demise of every living organism, and...<br /><br />A bad story to tell idealistic little kids. I suppose that's why they didn't have an "extended version" and whatnot. But, is a bad story a good enough reason to infer something fictional and untrue? Do we want to teach the leaders of tomorrow something that could eventually lead to the systematic destruction of an ecosystem and its inhabitants? What do you think? The answer is obvious so don't even answer. All of those questions were rhetorical, so don't even try. No, really. Stop debating me in your head. STOP!!!
