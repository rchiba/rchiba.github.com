I felt terrible yesterday.  I not exactly sure why though.  I'm feeling ok today luckly.  I have no idea what to do today.  I think I'm gonna have to do some of my homework.  I don't have that much though.  That's good.  I did mist if my homework on Monday.  I still have a few things left.  For me, this week has been going really slow.  I mean, I just had surgery only 3 days ago but it seems a lot longer.  Anyway, that's all I got for now.  LATER!!!
