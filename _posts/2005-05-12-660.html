I had a little speech ditty in English today and the funny thing was, I shook. I was practically vibrating. The tension steadily grew as my teammates presented their part of the project. By the time it was my turn, I was trembling from the knees down. It didn't help that I was wearing dorky shorts and a dorky yellow shirt. I survived though.<br /><br />I also went to a band concert ditty where I felt bad for myself because many people I knew were already in higher bands. This is where communism would come in handy. Since we are not a communist society, poorly performing individuals are chained down and discouraged from moving up. The good are awarded and paraded around in ceremonies involving trophies and clapping. In communism, we would all be equal and so I wouldn't feel so guilty that I'm not an excellent clarinetist. Communism. Is it a viable alternative? Perhaps in band.
