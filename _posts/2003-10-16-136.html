YAY!!!My sore throat is leaving!!!YAY!!!This week has been no problem when it comes to  updating on here.  Mainly it's because all I get to do is lay aroulnd the house all day and do nothing.REALLY!!! I can't do anything!!!The good part is that I get to stay up as late as I want and sleep in as long as I want. That's great but otherwise, it SUCKS!!! I can't wait to see all my friends again. I wonder what they'll all say? I wonder what teacher'll say when I get back? It sure has been good lyin' around all day though. I DON"T WANT IT TO STOP!!! But then again I do.  I'M CONFUSED!!!  Well, I'm all out of things to say.  SEE YA!!!

<br />P.S. I forgot, I got a lot better sleep last night and now my neck cramp is gone.  YAY!!!
