I guess it's significant that I'll be going to Washington D.C. tomorrow. And I suppose I'm being arrogant by being so nonchalant in recognizing this trip. I know a few people who've never been out of this area of the country. Having been dragged around and away from this country, I see travel like this as sort-of trivial. It's so hard to see it as anything else once you experience travel outside of the country. It's like how riding a bicycle just doesn't have the same excitement to it once you can drive a car. Or how booting Windows 95 doesn't have the same spunk as it did eleven years ago. It's the same, because it's exciting the first time, charming the second time, and familiar the third. I'm not a arrogant jerk. Really, I'm not. <br /><br />Well, there goes my plea for forgiveness for not being ecstatic about the trip. Planning to be depressed half the time anyways. It's <b>QuizBowl</b> for crying out loud. How could I <i>not</i> be depressed?<br /><br />Packed things. It's hard to pack little. I'm not a clothes person, but my folding is absurdly inefficient, so my baggage is stuffed with 50% clothes and 50% air, but still has trouble closing. Simply ridiculous! <br /><br />Well, I'm off to bed. And then to go on a nice little trip. If I happen to die on this trip, could someone archive this on a floppy or something? Thanks. I haven't backed up since winter.<br /><br />
