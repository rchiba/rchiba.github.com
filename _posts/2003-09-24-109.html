I have to go to the gym soon.
<br />In other news, OUR FREAKING FIELD TRIP WAS CANCELED. I hate it when this happens. I really wanted to go but the stupid weather screwed it up for me. Ryan has updated his site. I hope his site makes it to the big leagues, or to say the least, the amature leagues. I like to play with fire. I found out that if you dup a stick in wax, and burn it, it burns in a very high intensity. Very interesting.... Anyways, I hope I am not loaded with homework tommorow. I really need to just finish that report on Arnold. My conscience is always nagging me about it. I think I might have Multiple Personality Disorder. I don't know. I change personalities between school, and depending on who I meet. Hey, Just a shout out. If you are reading this, could you pleaaase sign my guest book. Ok, I think that is all
<br />peace
