It all started as a thought, like most stories do. Although, most stories don't involve such things as the one I am about to tell you. The thing is, the activity that is involved in my passage isn't as simple as it sounds. Building a robot that picks up balls and dumps them sounds easy to a layperson, anyone. Robots are all around us now. One can pick up a catalog, or go on the Internet, and find many robots. We take our fundamental state of life for granted. Like electricity, running water, and the wheel, robots take human ingenuity and determination to create. From news stories, to magazine articles, to the occasional startling introduction for a speech, one can surmise that the general talent pool of such a, today, crucial component of society is shrinking every year. It's only human nature to go where the money is, after all, money is the quantification of work and effort. Today, the money is in law and entertainment. Money is not in industrial technology, engineering, or science. Just ask students studying such things. They are simply not doing it for the money. And because attention is being suctioned away from such a genre of learning by popular culture, our future becomes darker every day.<br /><br />And things always seem to start with a thought. I'm sure Dean Kamen's idea to reverse this alarming trend originally started as a thought. A thought melds (if that's even a word) into a concept, a concept into a strategy, a strategy into a plan, and a plan into an action. In this case, the action was FIRST. And it's all so odd, that 15 years after the thought evolved into something more than a thought, I'm being affected by it. The sheer fact that something so seemingly distant can impact my insignificant, small existence is astounding, to me at least. It strikes me as something a bit odd, like a sparkling gem in an ocean of crud that comes along with being an adolescent.<br /><br />Personally, my interest in the robotics team stemmed from the fact that there is an animation contest in it. Now, my experience with animation is around 7 months. At the time, I had around 5 months of experience. In short, I was an educated novice. Before then, animation was just a hobby. Something that I hardly mentioned to my parents, and something that I kept to myself as something I could learn to do in my spare time. Many hours were spent reading books and tutorials from the library, and an equally great number of hours were spent in front of a computer learning how to create things out of nothing.<br /><br />Rather, this concept, I believe, is an inherent part of humanity itself. It seems so selfish to consider myself an example of such a thing, but I will do so. In history, I've seen a pattern within successful societies, and that is that they are usually the societies that possess the initiative and talent to create everything out of virtually nothing. Just as I can let a concept in my head flow onto a CG program, human society itself has been able to build skyscrapers from the ground, organize law in a fair and systematic way, and discover things that have never been discovered, reach places that have never been reached. One would think that such an integral part of humanity should be fostered, promoted, and encouraged to the general population. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. FIRST aims to change that, which is an admirable, as well as an obvious thing to do. Where would we, as a species, be if we were content with a stone wheel as an apparatus for transportation and other uses? Nowhere, that's where.<br /><br />Trudging forward, joining the robotics team seemed like a big mistake at first. The team members, I didn't really connect with. Being the sort of aloof kind of guy that I am, I was out of the loop. Jokes would fly over my head. Conversations would end in dead ends. Tasks were a chore. Staying late was a bore. The general first week consensus for myself was that it was a worthless program. Harsh, but so true to me at the time.<br /><br />And the season continued. Days flew by like hours, weeks like days, and six weeks were over by the time I knew it. In the time in which we built the robot, whether I would notice or not, we bonded. Not as in "sitting-down-and-playing-video-games" bonding. Nor as in "engaging-in-small-talk-in-spare-time" bonding. But bonding as in spending nights together in a stuffy room cutting metal, struggling on through the wee hours of the morning for the greater good of the team. Much like Calvin & Hobbes, with hardships comes character. I "know" the team, I can sense the aura of the team. If the team isn't feeling good, I don't feel good either. And it's all a really odd affair, how something as straightforward as building a robot can involve so many aspects. There's something that "clicks" when one is sharing a soda with a mentor or teammate during a particularly stressful night.<br /><br />Then come the regionals, a minefield full of opportunities as well as conflicts. You'd think that thing that whizzed by you was a foam ball from a renegade robot, but at regionals, the projectile could be a number of things. Mascots, other teams, sponsors, referees, judges. Everything flies by with intense ferocity. The social opportunities are endless. The connections you can make can carry on forever. Simple acquaintances today could be friends for tomorrow. And so I sat in the bleachers, and I cheered my lungs out, and I met lots of people. Simply put, regionals were everything FIRST promised me, and more. The impact wasn't a faraway dream, an unreachable ideal. These things, gracious professionalism, meeting new people, struggling and triumphing as a team, weren't in a promotional video anymore. Having these things in front of my eyes was more than enough to make me want to open them more.<br /><br />Stars sparkle at night, and I'm riding in the bed of a truck of a friend's car as we come home from regionals. I look up at the stars and contemplate such things. Tired from the rush of action, drab from the struggles and conflicts of a robotics team, desensitized to noise. I look up at the pinprick dots of light scattered around the sky, and wonder.<br /><br />"Is it all real, did I really meet all those people and cheer for all those teams?"<br /><br />And staring into the woods that engulf us, I manage to wring out a smile out of my tired face.<br /><br />Satisfaction that can only come from robotics. Character that can only come from hardships. I realize that Mr. Kamen made something out of nothing, impacted my life without even knowing me, and because of that have a relationship that doesn't even exist.<br /><br />And as the road unwinds beneath my feet, the orange streetlight flickers past me, and the world begins to feel rather small, in a good way.
