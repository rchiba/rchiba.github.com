Aren't surprise robotics competitions fun? It's sort of like surprise sex. Except being on the receiving side. What I'm actually trying to say here is that finding out that you will be attending a robotics competition tomorrow morning at 6:45AM is comparable to being raped.<br /><br />But, all nonsense aside, it's my fault entirely for pushing the IRI competition to the back of my mind while I caroused through my July. I'm just glad that it happened to fall on a date in which I do not work or volunteer. Now that I think about it, I don't think it'll be too bad. Familiar people, familiar bus ride, familiar robots. Being part of a small team is nice. It makes me feel purposeful and wanted (except when the small team rejects you, and then you just feel suicidal).<br /><br />There are negatives though that come with a whole day's plan being nullified. Ryan will be unhappy for me not showing up to the pool to keep him sane (I owe him a favor(s) now). I'll be parted from my beloved summer school class, and I'll have to make up worksheets and maybe a test when I get back on Monday. That and the whole waking up early thing. I'm decent at doing that though, so I shouldn't be complaining.<br /><br />I must now hurriedly print out a form for Mr. Florence (the leader of the West Lafayette robotics team) and forge my mother's signature on it. I bid thee farewell.
