Hello, and good morning folks.
<br />This is Ryo Chiba reporting.
<br />Anyways, my dad just got SSX Tricky for gamecube and it is very fun. I am trying to get myself away from games that cost money permanently. This is because it is expensive, timeconsuming, and wasteful. I mean, why buy a 50$ game when you know you'll get tired of it? Tell me. 
<br />Nothing much is happening here. I have a terrible aftertaste of the yogurt I just ate, so i think I'll brush my teeth soon.
<br />I am so close to school and I hate it. Just thinking of 8th grade makes me cringe. Cringe with fear of homework and time consuming projects that have no point. The teachers throw tons and tons of projects at us that are very pointless. There is no learning and nothing good about these projects. Its a totall lose-lose situation. Teachers lose class time. Students lose time and money spent on these projects. Not to mention the energy. I can understand why my classmates projects are always mediocre. It is so frustrating, you just stop living and die away. I hope the school changes soon because if this continues, I think childhood will become a thing of the past.
<br />Well, thats all.
<br />Just wanted to express my opinion about school projects.
<br />Well, tata ;)
