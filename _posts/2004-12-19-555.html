Finals Tomorow: French and Biology
<br />
<br />Finals have pressed me on time, which is partially why I haven't posted as much. I got a cameraphone now so I can take pictures and beam them to my ipaq, upon which I take the picture from my ipaq and post it on flickr.com, upon which it uploads to my site. Neat, huh?
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to study my french now. I wish I could talk, but as I sometimes say, "Work Hard, Play Hard".
