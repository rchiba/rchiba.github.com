I believe that I'm motivated to accomplish things because my parents don't appreciate the things I get done.<br /><br />It sounds selfish, but to me, it's the truth. Today, I spent five hours modeling and rigging a humanoid robot, and my father had nothing to say about it. It wasn't that he was dumbfounded with awe, but his silence was more of a signal that he didn't really even care enough to comment. And so, I go to school every day, do well, my parents don't really care. My grades are set, or at least that's what they think, because ever since the second grade, they've never even taken a look at my report cards. And why do I even try when no one cares? <br /><br />Well, oddly enough, I have this innate craving to impress my parents. Not really "oddly enough" though. I'm sure this primal urge to brag, boast, and rant about one's life is somewhat hard-wired into everyone's brain. Or at least, that's what I keep telling myself so I don't feel like a jackass every five seconds.<br /><br />And I keep working, hoping that someday they'll notice that I even exist. Really, that hope will never die down, even though the chances of them noticing are very slim. If only to get them to notice, I would do something great, or try to do something great. An accomplishment that could be valued. To be something, someone in life. <br /><br />But, I suppose that's how I describe my mad dash to become a hardcore blenderite. Perhaps, this is why I strive to understand this program, and to get things done in my lifetime. And although it seems like a pointless and horribly vain objective, to me, it's all the reason to keep trying.<br /><br />"Nonsense!", I tell myself.<br /><br />But my brain thinks otherwise.
