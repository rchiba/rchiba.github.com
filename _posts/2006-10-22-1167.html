Always things to do on the weekend now. <br /><br />Second Life is always a threatening diversion to real work, which includes a paper I have to write by next week. I have to get that done within the next few days (I <span style="font-style:italic;">should</span> have gotten part of it done today.) Tomorrow then, I guess. And articles to write. Newspaper will once again force me to write articles of garbage. So, that's a few more page of text to write. Tests. A lot of those to remember. A physics test tomorrow that I'd prefer to study for (but, obviously didn't prefer enough).<br /><br />At the lecture on Thursday, Amy Tan spoke about how she took so many classes in college that she had to read and write a paper on a book once a day. Thinking about how other people can do these amazing feats of concentrated effort is both disheartening and inspiring. <br /><br />Here I am, struggling to write a paper in two weeks. Pathetic.<br /><br />And other things continue to harass me, chiefly being the Lego League program at the nearby elementary school. Our robotics team is not to a level where we can competently lead elementary school children in a technical setting. They yell, fight, cry, distract, play, all sorts of things that children are supposed to do. It makes building a robot... difficult. The "research project" that they need to do is very much lacking as well. I don't even think a distinct topic has even been chosen yet. It's a very stressful situation.<br /><br />Tomorrow brings surprises.
