Yay to you Blog-thing, my life is stupid once again. I'll tell you why I am so ticked... Wait..No, let me have you guess? Can you? I thought so, since it's such a reacuring problem. Yep, the parents, namely Mom, are drunk. Yay me. And now mom wont get off my freaking case. Honestly, I can't stand her! Why is she on my case, may you ask? Well, yesterday, after I wrote, I went to go take a shower. What did she do? She waltzed right in! I COULD HAVE BEEN UNDRESSING! OK, so the door was open, but honestly, can't they knock? Can't they? I knock....
<br />I guess it all boils down to this; she cornered me. In the bathroom, in a corner, where I couldn't run. Too many memories resurfaced and I felt just like I was little again. I can't stand it.
<br />Am I going to be like this forever?
<br />~Amanda
