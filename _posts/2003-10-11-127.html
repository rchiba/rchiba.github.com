Hey it's me again and once again I'm REALLY sorry for not updating for so long.  But I'm back.  Anyway, today has been really boring.  I haven't done anything fun.  Today has been so boring that I don't even know what to write about.  Oh! I might as well tell you, I'm having surgery on Tuesday.  It's gonna suck.  It's going to kepp me out of school for a week!!!.  Hopefully I'll be getting some homework in advance.  Then, after that week is over, I won't be able to participate in gym at school for ANOTHER week!!!  MAN IS THIS GONNA SUCK!!!!!!  Oh well, there's nothing I can do about it.  The good part is that they aren't going to put that stupid sleeping gas mask on me, they are doing something different.  They put something on my arm and before I know it, I'm drifting off into wonfderland.  I'm still worried though and I'm not saying that I shouldn't be but surgeries really are nothing new to me.  I've had a lot more than most people.  Well, I had better go gather my thoughts in the little time I have.  Later. ;)
