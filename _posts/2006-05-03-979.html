I was furious at my English teacher today. I still am. Although, her actions were justified by protocol, they were still offensive to me. Sometimes it bothers me that people will follow rules to no avail. We lose the flexibility that makes us so human, limiting ourselves to certain actions using rules, regulations, protocols, and conventions.<br /><br />My class has a "word journal" that must be done as we read the play <i>Macbeth</i>. In the word journal, we must write down each occurence of the word in a "journal entry" and then write a paragraph about the underlying meanings and uses of the word in the specific passage. The whole thing is a large sum of work that takes a daily half hour to full hour. Really, it serves no purpose. I haven't gleaned a thing from it. But, I have kept up with it. Every day, I go home and read the act and write in the word journal. Sometimes, it's frustrating to work so long on something that you know is basically worthless. And once one begins to ask one's self, "<i>Why am I doing this?</i>", everything spirals downward. One begins to question, then one begins to rebel. But, I haven't, <i>yet</i>.<br /><br />The English teacher decided to collect and grade the half-finished word journals last Thursday. Because I was not there that day because of the Robotics trip, I had to hand it in yesterday. I forgot to turn it in yesterday because I spent the whole time focusing on other people's rough drafts in a bell-to-bell peer review activity. I walk up to my English teacher to explain to her my situation, and three words into my sentence, she says, "<i>I can't collect that, you had to hand it in <b>at the beginning of the period yesterday</b></i>."<br /><br />After that, I stepped back. Turning around, <b>the trigger</b> got pulled just a hair farther, and as I sat down, I couldn't help but feel stupid, angry, and remorseful at the same time. Muttering expletives under my breath, I begain to peruse through my book. Not even looking at the words, but going through the motions to try to get a grasp on my own mind. I begin to show signs of over-excitement, a series of symptoms before I undergo a mental breakdown. Elevated blood pressure, shallow breathing, increased heart rate. <br /><br />I understand why she did what she did. She followed the rules. She upheld the law. And, according to her rules, she doesn't collect late work. But, what bothers me is that she has rules prioritized over students.<br /><br />I sound selfish saying that I'm more important than the rules, but one cannot deny that it is a slap in the face for someone who has worked hard on something virtually worthless, for the sake of collecting the meager value of it, <b>to be denied of the value</b> because of a simple mistake. People forget things. I forgot something. And as a consequence, the time that I spent, and will spend, working on the word journal has less value, almost no value. And to have people who worked to less of an extent, to have them get full credit, <b>it pains me</b>.<br /><br />The whole situation, or my take on it, is all absurd. I admit that my anger is groundless and unfounded.<br /><br />I forget something, the teacher follows her guidelines, and I get frustrated. <b>It's all my fault. <br /></b><br />Sometimes, that's the most frustrating thing of all.
