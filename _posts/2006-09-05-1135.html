I do not want to get a cold. Please, cold, listen to me.<br /><br />Especially now. Please don't get worse, cold. I talk to you because I know that if you hear me out, you'll understand why it's a reasonable request for you to infect someone else. You see, I thought I was going to have a good week until now, my friend. If you get worse inside of me, I'll have to worry about carrying so much more. Tissues, cough drops, medicine, etc. If you get worse, then I'll have to worry about contacting other human beings. I have to be careful about what I touch. And if you get worse, then I don't know what I'll do besides cough and snivel and wait a week or two until you go away.<br /><br />I can't do homework quickly with your headaches in my head. I can't write those essay questions at school, or effectively participate in lively discussions about the role of chinese literature in the modern automobile industry. I can't do a lot of things with you, cold. So I think right now would be a good time for you and I to part. Maybe forever.<br /><br />I know you like to be with me, you've been with me since the beginning. But, can't you see it in your heart to let me be as I am for the time being? In a month or two maybe, when it's winter and everyone's sick. But, not now. I've got articles to write and pictures to take and skits to prepare and prelabs to write. You've got to see that it's in both of our best interests if you just jump ship and use someone else as a host. I'm not that great of a host anyways. I don't really get out much, I have little skin-to-skin human contact, I like to use antibacterial soap. So, I'm definitely a sub-par choice for sickening. <br /><br />It's only the beginning, I'm feeling your presence, but I'm not sick enough to have any obvious symptoms. You'll be here tomorrow, unless these words convince you to die. <br /><br />And in reality, I'm not telling you to just go away.<br /><br />I'll be blunt then. <i>I'm telling you to die.</i> Die inside of my body right now. Feel the <b>wrath</b> of my immune system, <b>bitch</b>. <i>Fuck</i> viruses and <i>fuck</i> common colds. You're going to hell, cold virus. There just isn't a place for you up here, you know that, <i>don't you?</i> So there, those are your orders. Submit to my commands. <br /><br /><i>Please?</i>
