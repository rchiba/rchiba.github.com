<span style="font-style:italic;">And nothing to look backward to with pride,<br />And nothing to look forward to with hope,<br />So now and never any different.</span> - <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Death of the Hired Man by Robert Frost</span><br /><br />I am a hypocrite. <br /><br />I wish I didn't care about my GPA. I wish I could really believe that it's just a number. To not lie to myself. To believe that a student's actions are more important than the number the teacher stamps on their forehead. Maybe it has something to do with my identity. It's an identity that manifests itself in everyone I talk to. It's constantly in my thought. It's how I act. It's what I try to be. It's what other people thing I'm supposed to be. It's why I envy. Why I lust for goals I'll never ever reach. <br /><br />Due to circumstances, I will soon be parting from the wonderful 4.0. The thing I've lied to you about for so long. In reality, I put a lot of value on it. When I lose it, my identity will no longer be as it used to be. Who am I? Am I being arrogant in harboring such feelings?<br /><br />Is it worth making a scene about? Absolutely not. Or maybe I'm trying to justify my failure. The failure, it's a result of what I did, what I didn't, what I should've, what just wasn't. The loss is my fault. My stupid, arrogant, foolish, fault. I didn't solve the problems I needed to solve. Time was up. Papers collected. Bam. So, that's how it went. And that's how I feel about it. No one cares.<br /><br />Didn't want to talk all day. Just felt angry and sick. So ashamed. Mad. Wanted to forget, wanted to believe in something. Wanted to be a good at something. A talent? Specialty? Passion? Everyone's special, right? People can create art, people are good at reading, people can sell used cars. Me?<br /><br />Nothing. I have access to many great things. I'd love to keep them, for them to become part of me. To sketch out an identity for myself.<br /><br />But, at the end of the day, on the inside, I have nothing to call my own. Everything's been loaned.
