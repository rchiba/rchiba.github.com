I'm typing this post early to adjust my sleep schedule. If I don't type it now, I would probably start typing at 10, get distracted by the wonders of Internet surfing, and finish a smallish post at around 11. I'm hoping to be asleep by 10 or so, and wake up at around 5am. It gives me a good seven hours of sleep. And enough time in the morning to wake up and wipe off the mental grime that accumulates during sleep.<br /><br />When I was in middle school, I always wondered what high school was like. Older people told me that things actually mattered in high school. I never really understood them, because I was an ignorant, idealistic kid who thought that things in middle school actually mattered too. Now I know that I could have gone through middle school with sub-par grades and gotten away with it without penalty. How I see high school, things do matter. But, just high school itself is too easy. To turn this basic education into a more fulfilling experience, you have to join a few extracurricular activities, juggle a social crisis or two, and throw in an attempt to record all of this in text and images. <br /><br />You always have to throw in something new every year, to spice things up. During freshman year, it was joining the diving team. During sophomore year, it was joining robotics. This year will feature the addition of managing a fledgling relationship. I really don't know what <i>"managing a fledgling relationship"</i> means yet, but I'll find out in a few days. The addition of a few more social events in my life means less time spent moping around in my room. I'd say that's a very good change.<br /><br />I looked back to what I posted exactly a year ago and was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't nervously posting about the upcoming school year. So, I guess I <i>wasn't</i> born an anxious wreck after all.<br /><br />In other news, if you are of Arab descent, drive a minivan, and have a bunch of cell phones in said minivan, then you're a terrorist. <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/13/van_full_of_cellphon.html" title="BREAKING NEWS: All arabs are terrorists." target="_blank">[LINK]</a> I guess the charges by the FBI against these men would make sense if you didn't remember that <i><b>thousands of other people are buying and selling prepaid phones merely for profit.</b></i> We should be concerned because discriminatory arrests like these have been happening here for a long time. A few decades back the government was arresting communists, before then it was the Japanese, before then it was the Irish. Before long, they'll be arresting anyone wearing polka dots.   <br /><br />
