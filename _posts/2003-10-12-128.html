Wow, The "JUSTIN" strikes back,
<br />As you can see, he is getting surgery. Lets all give our regress to him. GO JUSTIN!
<br />Anyways, day 2 of cow costume. I am still wearing it and am delighted with it. It just purely ROCKS. It is really cool, I mean, I even wore it to the movie theatre, it might have got alot of attention, but it is reallly cool. I can't wait till halloween. I don't know what to type right now because it is early in the day, so I'll write back later with my cowland adventures,
<br />SEYYA

<br />P.S.:GOOD LUCK JUSTIN, LET GOD BE WITH YA!
