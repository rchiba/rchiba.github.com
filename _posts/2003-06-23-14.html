Hello, its me again. I am kind of bored. I am afraid school is so close, but i guess it's better than typing away at your blog on the internet. Well, a few days ago I went to Japan. I went all over the place and it was fun. I have a ton of pictures and movie clips. Guess what?! A typhoon hit when i came. I guess I am unlucky or something because that kind of stuff happens to me all the time. Oh well, seeing the plate metal roof getting torn off by the wind was pretty cool. My uncle went on the roof to see what was happening. It was very memorable. It is very weird when you come back to America from Japan. The sheer space everywhere just blows your mind. You dont know how small everything is in Japan! Today I gotta wash the dog. Her name is Shadow and it is a very hyper labrador retriever. There is a flea advisory warning and I dont want to have our house full of fleas and ticks and such. Did I mention that I play Runescape and tennis alot? I am sort of, kinda out of shape so my dad is trying to get me to work out more often. Its a nice, sunny day outside. The only downside to it is that there is absolutely no wind right now. Not even a measely breaze. I like wind for some reason. Well, thats all for now. TA TA ;)
