I spent today writing my speech, attending a robotics meeting, and printing/labeling 500 CD's for the robotics competition in Atlanta that is quickly approaching. I leave on Wednesday for the thing.<br /><br />One of my Robotics teammates parents who works at Purdue reminded me that the Graphics major (animation professional) wanted to meet me sometime. Meeting someone like this is a dream come true for me. I'm hoping that I'll be able to arrange something over the quickly approaching summer.<br /><br />I got back from the CD printing/labeling binge thirty minutes ago. It's 1:44 in the morning, and I haven't obtained a second of sleep. School is going to be painful.<br /><br /><b>But, through the hardship comes character. </b><br /><br />My eyes hurt.
