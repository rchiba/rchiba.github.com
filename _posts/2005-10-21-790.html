I wish upon a shining star...<br /><br />That my old Linux computer will someday be able to connect to my wireless network.<br /><br />Well, besides my silly wishes, I'm practicing to pass the amateur radio exam that I'm going to be taking tomorrow morning. The books I've borrowed from the library have either called the exam extremely hard, or extremely easy. <br /><br />I'm almost, but not quite, sure that I'm ready. I've taken practice exams on the Internet, and I can pass them. If I pass the exam tomorrow, I will be satisfied with myself, which is a pretty big step for my crushed ego.<br /><br />I must continue studying, so I bid thee farewell for now.
