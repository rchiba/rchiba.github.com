Amazingly, homework was not as grueling today. <br /><br />Besides gaming for thirty minutes, which I am ashamed to admit, I memorized all major midwest cities and all the countries in Africa. If you gave me a blank map of Africa, I'm sure I could fill it all up with countries. For this achievement, I am proud. For, how often does one memorize a whole continent worth of countries? I timed myself and found out that I can identify all of them within a minute. Impressive, eh? Well, I like to think that, trying to stand out and all. But, I'm sure my QuizBowl peers already have that covered. I'm always a step behind, but I keep up, managing to survive.<br /><br />I have a backlog of sketches to ink and scan. Perhaps I will do that this weekend. Unfortunately, I am having an eerie premonition that I am going to have loads of homework this weekend. Stacks and stacks and and endless array of stacks. Miles of paper, gallons of ink, pounds and pounds of papers to be written by Monday. That's the kind of feeling I'm getting. <br /><br />Who cares about what I think? No one, so if you read the above, then you probably have no social life. Insults all around, folks.<br /><br />I find it frustrating to see a culture become so obsessed with "dances", "proms", and "parties". I find it absurd that these silly social situations hold such importance. Yes, perhaps these meetings are a way for one to demonstrate social skills, but besides that, what's the purpose? Whenever I go to a gathing involving other people, I have no "fun". I don't find mingling with other people "fun". I can't see how dancing can be "fun". Yes, perhaps humans have a primal urge for rhythm, but satisfying this urge is as easy as turning on the radio. Silly gatherings of people dancing, shouting, talking, and eating just seem too chaotic to be of any use for me. <br /><br />But, alas, that's not how I'm supposed to think, according to society. Television and movies always portray high school dances as integral parts of one's life. I find them to be boring, pointless social scenes. I'm not going to any sort of "party" or "dance" if I can help it. I don't see any rationale to it.<br /><br />Social lives, who needs them?
