Yes, somehow I've been able to secure a Dell Optiplex while in this prison-like university I'm staying in for the Washington D.C. Trip.<br /><br />My supposed "teammates" are going off to watch some pirated movie on a snazzy laptop computer. I assumed that I would either be deterred by the subject of the movie, or would be excluded from the experience since I'm not particularly skilled at conversing and exchanging social cues with other people. Persay, I haven't been able to "warm up" to the people on my team (even though I've been with them for the past year or so.) Plus, I get enough movies at home.<br /><br />The room I am staying in truly resembles a prison. The unpainted, concrete block walls conjure up correctional facilities almost automatically. They give you an old, stale towel and a tiny bar of soap. The only other "amenities" that are in this dank room are two old desk lamps and a bunk bed. The doors, windows, and the closets are all made of cheap plywood and squeak often. They don't even give you sufficient covering for the beds. An thin blue sheet serves as a "blanket" that has to protect against the worn building's dysfunctional heating/cooling system. Truly, this would be a time when you can say, "Oy Vey."<br /><br />The matter of the fact is, Zach think's I'm inferior to him. At every witty comment I make, he turns his head solemly, as if saying, "Fool, do not try to be witty since you are already labled as inferior." It frustrates me so I just keep going on with it. I go on with the comments with the hope that someday I'll be as witty as my peers, but Zach doesn't even give me a chance. He constantly "jokes" about wanting to kill or torture me (which is quite disturbing.) To amplify the insanity of it all, he shares a room with me. Being in a prison room with a sinister king would be the description I would label on this whole escapade. <br /><br />The Gmail servers are down for some time so I can't email all of my friends, which is a shame since I just found the computer labs. It's quite unfortunate. I suppose I'll surf alone. In this lonely computer lab. A lonely, dimly lit, almost silent computer lab. The sound of the keys and the hum of computer fans are the only sounds around me. I wish Andrew or some other non-Zach person would have come. I bet he or she would save me from the insanity of it all.
