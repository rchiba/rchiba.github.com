To burst into the new schedule that starts tomorow, I...
<br />
<br />PAINTED MY SPEAKERS WHITE!
<br />
<br />Anyways, operation "speaker paint" has gone quite well. I'll have to upload photos tommorow. Unfortunately, I'm not quite sure I'll be able to, me being increasingly busy and whatnot. Don't worry, that usually means even more... shall we say, "colorful" posts.
<br />
<br />Yup, this is it. Tommorow is school. Wish me good luck... Please.
