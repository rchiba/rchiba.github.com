I feel dizzy.<br /><br />I haven't studied.<br /><br />I can't concentrate.<br /><br />I should have studied.<br /><br />But why didn't I?<br /><br />Well, to tell you the truth, it's because I'm a lazy imbecile. <br /><br />So, because of this fact, I am going to go to bed early so I can wake up early tomorrow morning and go on a studying binge.<br /><br />Wish me good luck.
