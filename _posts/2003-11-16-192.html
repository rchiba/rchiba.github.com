Today was so pointless for me.
<br />I ate fatty foods, vegged out, played gory video games on my obsolete game console, and went to the movies on the same day. I feel like a fat lomox. And guess what?... I have a English quiz ,that I will probably fail, tomorow.
<br />
<br />Oh yea, I forgot to write somthing down in the last post. Ok...
<br />---------------------------
<br />It all started when we got to Olive Garden. We were all very happy, and ordered our food untill... The waiter came. We all said we wanted water so... She got our 4 waters and the last one (my moms) Spilled all over her and the table. It was like a wall of water, and I was there to see it. Her reaction? Lets just say that she wasn't very pleased after that... She was in a bad mood for hours. Anyways, we got the food free, but my moms still has regrets of going there....
<br />---------------------------
<br />Anyways, tomorow is school and I should get ready. I really gained alot of fat today...
