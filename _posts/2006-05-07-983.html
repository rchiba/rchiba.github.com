A site redesign has taken place. Please, if you can, inform me about any gripes, broken links, broken images, misaligned text, browser incompatibility, excessive loading times, etc. I've tested the site on the three major browsers (IE, Firefox, Opera), and all three work on the site. Opera can't show the neat typewriter font, as it doesn't support embedded fonts, so keep this in mind when moving from browser to browser when viewing this site. <br /><br />Over the years, I've learned that A good designer holds reasons for the elements in the design that is created. For this reason, I present to you my explanation of the nonsense that you see here. First things first. Text. I focused on keeping everything clean, but making certain things <b>bold.</b> Before, the date was grey and small. Now it is black and bold. I went with the typewriter theme because  typewriters are associated with dark, lonely rooms. At least, in my mind they are. The dirty, gritty typewriter title fonts reflect the dirty, gritty truth of the day. The banner reflects the contrasting things I write on here, as well as the fact that I do this for myself, and myself only.  The black line that streaks from banner to footer just ties everything together. I still have to edit all of my buttons so they won't look as gaudy in their color. These things will be done in another weekend in the future (probably when summer gets here).<br /><br />A fleck. I saw a fleck drifting across the computer screen. The fleck starts to grow bigger as it drifts towards me. It ends up being a tiny insect of some sort. Its miniscule wings that I can't even see, the stupid nature of its pattern of flight. <br /><br />Sometimes, things don't even seem alive, but they are. That small insect could have passed for a inanimate speck of dust, or a dead pixel on my monitor. I find this much like meeting new people. <br /><br />I've always had trouble meeting, and establishing a permanent relationship with new people. Before I meet a person, they are just another swish of color that passes me in the hallways between period X and period Y. They may drink from the water fountain next to me, brush against me in the hallways, or even sit behind me in a non-honors class, but nonetheless, I often fail to remember them at all. Another generic stranger. Just another somebody, almost a nobody.<br /><br />This changes so much when one eventually comes to meet these passers-by. These strangers are given a face, a name, and a personality. They laugh a certain way, talk a certain way, and walk a certain way. A certain way that makes them different than everyone else. These people have stories, these people have wisdom. Some more than others, but everyone has at least one tidbit. If you're lucky, they may even remember how your name as well.<br /><br />Personally, I think it's amazing, the fact that so many people I know now were just faceless strangers just two years ago. To know that the mysterious, nameless people that surround me constantly, that bombard me from all directions, may someday be my friends (or enemies) is a truly fascinating thing. It gives one new perspective when entering an ordinarily mundane hallway or classroom. Or perhaps I think this way only to keep myself from going insane from doing the same thing over and over everyday.<br /><br />But the situation with the insect is slightly different. <br /><br />I don't enjoy pondering my future relationship with this insect, nor do I enjoy sharing a room with it.
