Just hit the play button already, dammit.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ge2FHDf_L78"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ge2FHDf_L78" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>
