Acomplishments this weekend: 1. Watched "Shallow Hal"... 2. Burned a "Beatles" and "Modest Mouse" CD... 3. Well, that's about it.<br /><br />I've just wasted two CD's trying to create a "Modest Mouse/ The Beatles" compilation mix. Roxio Easy CD Creator has given me too many errors. Wasted too many ruined CD's, or coasters. I am banishing Roxio and it's sick, unacceptable products. It's this simple, Roxio sucks. Use Windows Media Player to rip and burn CD's. Don't use Roxio. It just sucks. I hate Roxio now. Ban their products!
