Is it the end of the beginning, or is it the beginning of the end?<br /><br />I can't even tell anymore, my minds gone bonkers, I could really tell today that more sleep would be a viable option. Not only did I feel ashamed after my failure on the recent French assignment, I also felt anguish between every class. This weight of life keeps pushing me down, and I can't help but feel like I'm walking in sand. Not that walking in sand is bad. I once saw a shirt in the hallway that said, "Pain is weakness leaving the body." I thought that saying was very insightful, and whenever I see that shirt floating around in the crowd, life seems better. Now, justification is found in wallowing in my self-pity.<br /><br />I think it's funny that I actually talk about feelings. It's all talk, talk, talk. You know, feelings are so fake. Just the mind playing tricks with our primal emotions. When one realizes that emotions are silly, work gets done. People actually do things once restrictive barriers like this are eliminated. I believe that true achievement only comes from the most efficient folks. And the most efficient folks don't have "feelings" to get in the way. <br /><br />And still, I rant on about what I "believe." These sick misconceptions and half-thought out viewpoints are mangling together in my head, creating semi-truth facts and basis for shaky arguments. I'm putting the world together, but in the wrong way. Logic is flying out the window, and I have no idea what I was thinking earlier.<br /><br />What was I talking about? Emotions are the single most important thing a human can have. What is literature, art, joy without feelings? A refined culture, a sophisticated and most regal society can only function with emotion. Let the efficiency go to the dogs if we must, but our Earthly desires can only be satisfied by feeling the sensations. Even if these sensations are just mind tricks, let them exist.<br /><br />Gah, I'm feeling conflicted.
