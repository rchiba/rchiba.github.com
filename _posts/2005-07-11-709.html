I'm sick of teenagers getting paid outrageous amounts of money to do mundane things. People are getting paid $80 to mow lawns. This operation usually takes about a half hour and basically, you sit in a chair and steer. If adults are perfectly happy blowing continuous money to pay a bunch of rejects to cut vegetative strands, then I'm sure they'll all be just glad to donate a few bucks to their favorite charity. That just doesn't happen though. Kids are getting paid to walk pets, water plants, and even CLEAN THEIR OWN FREAKING HOME! What in the <insert EXPLETIVE HERE>?!<br /><br />If you can't clean your own house, then you probably suffer from some unfortunate psychological disease, or you're a fat slob. The latter would be most likely. Houses are now predominantly structured in a capitalistic/adultistic way. Children work, as adults order them. Once the children grow older and become greedy and corrupt, the parents have to bribe them or "pay" them to do "chores." This supposedly teaches the child how to "manage" their money. I think that all it does is get kids to learn how to use their parents as cash cows until they move out. I see people whose parents are paying a monthly paycheck (e.g. "allowance") to teach the child how to "manage" their money. What do they spend this paycheck on? Candy, luxuaries, and convenience goods. "Games" are another wastrel purchase that are common. Are these completely unneeded purchases "teaching" children how to "manage" their money? I don't see how. How the parents can translate "money management" into "buying crap that you don't need with someone else's money." It's absolutely disgusting.<br /><br />That's why all children should grow up in a communist household. Everyone must work for the common good of the household. Five year plans must be set up for maximum household work efficiency. Civic duty should be why you work. Not because you get to blow your money on nonsense after your "chore." Money would be saved, kids would learn faithful work ethic, and the world would be full of happily prancing unicorns and lots of rainbows if communism was standard fare for the governing systems of American households. Start pasting up posters of an idealistic future, and commence the glorification of science! I'm all for a communist American household.
