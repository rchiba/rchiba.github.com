I don't feel good and I feel angry because I have to go to the gym and all I want to do is sit down and do nothing because I feel degraded at mathcounts I only got a 4 out of 30 on a test and I feel stupid and because of this I feel extremely frustrated and I have to write a speech. That's today in a mouthful. Nothing happened besides some kid who jumped and cracked his neck/skull on the top of the door. That just shows you how smart my school is. I am so stupid. Devin gets the highest grade and I am always the lowest person out of the whole stack. I don't understand anything and it is hard to acomplish anything when you don't understand anything. I am sinking into the darkness...Geronimo
