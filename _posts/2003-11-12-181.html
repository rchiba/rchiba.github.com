Ok amanda, not much of a post there but, who cares?
<br />
<br />Anyways, I need rage management. I am ready to kill someone on the roulette of Russia. Or is that the Russian Roulette?
<br />I am particularly angry in gym. Angry at certain individuals everywhere. Angry that I only live for the short ammount of 24,000 days. Angry about anything and everything, but you dont see that in me, do you.... I keep it all inside, as I twitch. It's inside, a mystery....
<br />
<br />Anyways, my life is great, how's yours? if you send me an E-mail, I'll publish you if it is long and good. Anyways, it is a great day outside but it is extremely windy. And cold also. I'll just keep swimming. 
<br />
<br />Also, at school my internet publicity has started popping up again. I must crush it. Very tediously get it to subside. But, on the other hand, I can use my strategies to my advantage. I shall play my cards....
<br />
<br />Also, I have found out somethings.... I have discovered that some people are working for alpha leader #1...
<br />Names I will not mention, but, this means goodbye, alpha leader #1 cohort....
<br />
<br />Well, that is the information for the day...
