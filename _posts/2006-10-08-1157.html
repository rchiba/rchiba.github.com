<span style="font-style:italic;">"Being a good writer is 3% writing skill and 97% not getting distracted by the Internet."</span><br /><br />Ironically, I found this quote in a forum user's signature. Since looking at it, all I've done is realize more and more how true it is. Already, I've surfed Boingboing.net and Digg.com a few times. They're staples of late night post-homework vegetation, sure, but it's just as stupid as watching TV. No offense to television watchers. <br /><br />I'll have to keep working on restraining myself. It's hard though. Wikipedia could keep me up all night. I get curious about a topic and go to its site, then just go in circles by clicking the links inside the article to other related articles. The links within articles is a helpful feature, but a very distracting one. A few minutes ago, the chain went a little like this:<br /><br />Snow Crash -> Metaverse -> Avatar -> Anonymity -> Con Artist -> Australia -> Australian-Rules Football<br /><br />The time spent reading these articles slowly starts to replace sleep time and work time and all sorts of time. Maybe I'm learning something, but I don't think I am. Sort of like reading a tabloid, I guess, my data retention is very poor. <br /><br />And even as I write this, I'm getting the urge to hit my Windows key to get out of the program and open up the big box of Internet my computer is connected to. So very tempting... To check an inbox that rarely has any new messages in it, or to wiki some random topic, or to browse poorly-drawn anthro on DeviantArt.<br /><br />Friday and Saturday were filled with enough content to shove all my writing aside. This sort of content usually contains certain crucial elements. New elements. Female elements.<br /><br />Being in a relationship is splendid, but changing my priorities so abruptly is a little weird-feeling. Every day, I look forward to those moments when we're together, and writing, sleeping, hobbies, extracirricular activies, and homework all get shoved aside in the name of love. It never used to be like this, but then again, I've never had a girlfriend before. I'm still learning, and my time management skills will improve with practice (I hope).<br /><br />Now, I'm off to be distracted by the Internet.
