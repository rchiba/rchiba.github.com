The sad thing is that I'm too shy.<br /><br />I'm too shy, even on the Internet.<br /><br />I browse my favorite tech and furry forums every day, reading what others have to say, but I just read. I am suscribed, and have the oportunity to post, but do I?<br /><br />No, because I just sit there and read. I suppose the fear of posting is being perpetuated by what I read. Everyone else's posts seem so tactful, articulate, and sophisticated. Whenever another forum member posts, I am awed by their magnificient wordsmanship. But, sadly, the amazingness of everyone else is just make believe. <br /><br />Other people aren't writing things that are better than I could write. Well, I suppose people are, but not substantially better. I'm human, so I should stand up and communicate like everyone else in the world is. But, here I am, sitting in an office chair in a dimly lit, humid room. Trying to communicate using a medium that is sadly unidirectional. How am I ever going to learn how to convey my thoughts if all I can do is type inside of a little text box on a website? It's not going to help me, and reading other peoples' writings just makes me hate what I write. I can already see my faults. I use the word "I" too much as the subject of my sentences. The structure of my sentences does not flow. I have awkward paragraph structure. I can't even keep the same tense sometimes. And you know what? You can't use "and" at the beginning of a sentence, or use "you", because that is unprofessional. Everyone seems so perfect and clean, precise, clear. The imagery imparted by the books I read are beautiful. What I write is garbage.<br /><br />Self-esteem, such an intangible thing. I suppose rewards like self-esteem are earned, not given. <br /><br />Carpe diem.
