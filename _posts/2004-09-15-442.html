My internet connection has been down for the past 4 days, so that's why I was unable to call, communicate to anyone, or update this blog for the past 4 days. The insight BB man said that our Vonage router was not registered, thus blocking our whole connection. I don't know.

<br />I hate it in study hall when everyone is just sitting there, usually talking or laughing, or generally socializing. I hate it so very much. I am working for the full 50 minutes and everyone else is just talking! They make themeselves look so ignorant. I don't think they even have homework. Grrr... The envy is growing in me every day....
<br />
<br />ANyways, I have the hardest Honors Biology test in the year tomorow ( I have no idea why this test is so hard, so early ) and I am planning to study full force tonight. I am just really annoyed by those study hall people. Really ticked off...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I found this site called www.thisisbroken.com, or something like that. I really like it. I found it in my most recent issue of PopSci magazine. On the topic of PopSci, I LOVE IT! Anyways, I'm thinking into purchasing 3 radiohead cds, but need Devin's advice first. Unfortunately, he seems all but absent from phone, email, and face to face contact these past few days. I can never catch him. I really need his advice though. I trust him.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am just terribly shaken up because of the impending doom also known as my honors biology test comming up, so I think I'll be done posting for the day and study. Oh yea, I have pictures from Chicago's Millenium Park, or whatever. I'll post them ASAP.
