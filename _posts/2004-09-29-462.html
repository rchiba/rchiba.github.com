I was picked for quiz bowl. This is a very, extremely surprising thing. I am so superfragishly happy! It's like... unbelieveable. Undeniable euphoria is overwhelming me. And also keeping me from doing my essay and various other works I have to do soon. I went to diving today, saw Ryan smack the water a few times. He was so red, you could have mistaken him for the Japanese flag. Obviously, I fell behind, but Rachel joined our little gathering and it's all good and happy. Cheeseman... you've gotta love that name!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have enveloped myself in RadioHead. I really need more of a music collection, because sooner or later, I'll get bored of RadioHead, and I'll forget about them. I don't want that happening. I've just got to mention again, my overwhelming euphoria from getting into quizbowl. It's euphoric. 
<br />
<br />I killed a bug on the computer desk a few seconds ago. I'm begining to suspect that my computer is full of bugs (The ones that squirm around when you slowly rip them apart), which would explain why it makes a cracking noise every once in awhile. Stupid bugs, always running into the computer fan. Maybe I should clean the computer... or not.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I've planned my movie out, mostly. I've scheduled a date with Ryan for the Saturday of this week. A interview scene he has to act out. I hope he has a shred of talent, or else he's dead. Not really. No... really. Some school teacher or some hippie is going to find me and then say that I wanted to kill Ryan and then charge me with conspiracy to murder, and then I'll go to jail. So for the last time, all you hippies, no, I'm not going to kill anyone. I'm starting to share my hippie-disliking thoughts of Oliver. 
<br />
<br />Oliver... Such an awesome name. Like Cheeseman. Oliver sounds like Olive, so it reminds me of Olive Garden, where they have chicken alfredo which also is the most awesome dish in the world, but it costs 11 bucks, so it sucks if you only have 10 bucks, because chicken alfredo is awesome. Yes, Oliver... mmmm...
<br />
<br />I need to think of a thing for my essay. I'm thinking of a more unified world federal government that collects taxes from everyone and distributes the services equally to everyone. Social security, medicare, stuff like that. People would have less kids, and the world wouldn't be big anymore. 
<br />
<br />Fine, maybe that's not plausible right now, but I'm really sleepy and that's all I can think of. Except maybe, the unified federal government brainwashing everyone to become avatars of the "perfect" human. What an efficient society that would be. No more smokers loitering at the library. No more scary people at school with chains stuck to their pants for some strange odd reason. Yes, no more idiots who pretend to be funny, but are really just morons.
<br />
<br />Talking about scary kids with chains stuck to their pants, what are those chains for? I always thought the chains were for self defence, but who are you going to defend yourself from? Plus, it's kind of embarassing to stick chains to your pants. I mean, you can call it "cool" or whatever, but it just looks stupid. It's like sticking a metal straw in your ear and calling it cool. It just doesn't make any sense. You have to drag all that around and for what? Other kids calling you "cool"? I don't think so. I think that is the most dysfunctional thing I see all day. Chains on your pants? Give me a break.
