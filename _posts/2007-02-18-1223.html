Showed the robotics team animation at open house today. I was very discouraged when I found out that West Lafayette's animation team didn't improve very much. The Jefferson team didn't even have an animation to show (I shouldn't blame them, I was supposed to help them make one). Ah well... Below is team 1747's animation.<br /><br /><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=8346854853682661977&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed><br /><br />Browsing <a href="http://www.chiefdelphi.com/">chiefdelphi.com</a>, a forum for robotics teams (and thus robotics teams' animators), I found a few animations that are <i>miles ahead</i> of ours. I know the mentor from team 1625 personally (Pete Casey), and he's a nice guy. Very impressive stuff these folks strut:<br />Team 114 (Los Altos, CA) Animation: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=600450062930783891">[LINK]</a><br />Team 1625 (Winnebago, IL): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtzHZsaKiA8">[LINK]</a><br /><br />This evening was spent drilling holes into the robot. Finally, some quality time to connect with the thing.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/136/394718724_308db35192.jpg?v=0" />&nbsp;<br /><br /><big>I love happy endings.</big>
