Hey...
<br />I wonder, is there a disease that slowly eats you away inside? Something that makes you feel in control, but then turns you around? Is there some hidden disease that is making me feel such pain and misery? Sometimes, blog-thing, I don't want to go on. I just want to sit here and die. die. die. Ryo would probably scold me for complaining, I just feel so lost and hurt inside. So lost... I feel so big when people tell me I'm not, and I can look in the mirror and see I'm not, but in pictures I dislike me so much. I just want to make this pain real, maybe... No. I've thought about it. I can;t break my promise to Angela..
<br />~Amanda
