It's completely absurd how vocabulary has become so skewed in the past few years. First it was trippy psychedelic slang, then it was ghetto language, and now it's nonsense 1337 speak and other vulgar slang terms.<br /><br />I mean, I was reading the writings of a peer recently (Via Xanga, eww...) and found that they had met a "shit-load" of people. I'm not quite sure how that word crept into the English language, but many words do. It seems like teens these days have to cram their language with words that have roots in vulgarity. Calling another person a "penis" or "gay fag" is somehow supposed to communicate to others that you do not like them. What if they are gay? I suppose you're stating a fact, but how does that correlate to you not liking them? What's with the anti-homosexual atmosphere? If I called you a "heterosexual", would that be a complement? <br /><br />Or, if you add "shit" or "crap" to a word, it somehow puts more emphasis on the word you add it to. In this day and age of computers, technology, and spell-checking programs, how do we get this kind of terminology? If you meet a "shitload" of friends, how many friends is that? Is it how many friends can fit in your rectum at a time, or are you making an analogy to manure piles on farms? If people are to use these terms effectively, everyone should have a standard. Suppose we make "shitloads" of people a standard measurement. A standard "shitload" would be 15 people. That way, the term is not so relative. A "shitload" of people for me might be 4 or 5, but a "shitload" of people to a socially active teen might be 15-20. But, wait. What about metric "shitloads"? Is that 2.1 times a standard "shitload?" We must unite to have set protocols for our terms. Yes, calling your peers "fagwads" may be all machoist and all (if you hang out with people of a lower intelligence), but it fails to communicate information effectively. Establish protocols! Workers of the world, unite! The only things you have to lose are the chains of tyranny! A little Marx for you.
