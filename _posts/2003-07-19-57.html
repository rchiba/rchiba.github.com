Guess what everyone!!!
<br />I get to go to my friends house today. He has a lake house and I am going to spend the night and I cant wait. We are going to do tons of stuff! But as I waited for this day to come, I still am getting closer to school. I dont want to go. I DONT WANNNAA!!!!!!!!!! Well, I kind of do, but I know there will be tons of homework which will be hard to keep up with. And those hard tests which will see if we can get into high school. I am afraid, very afraid. My Blood Pressure is rising, rising, and rishing. I gotta get myself to calm down. Take deep breaths. OK, now I'm situated.
<br />Lets talk about other things. Anyways, I got 2 gift certificates at school because the band voted me the best bandsman 2 years in a row. And right before I decided to go to the store, It closed. It was sold to another music company based in a city near here. Now, I decided to go on their website and see what I wanted to buy with the 20$ in gift certificates. I saw this awesome mouthpiece for my clarinet. And it was clear. It is a clear plastic mouthpiece. I decided to fork over my certificates for that, but I had one problem. I still had to pay 20$ more because the mouthpiece cost 40$. Luckily, my mom paid that price. So with the money all settled. I called the phone number for the new music company and ordered it. Now its coming on Wednesday. I cant wait. ;)
