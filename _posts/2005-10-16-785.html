On <a href="www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> today, I heard from an aquaintance about "NaNoWriMo".<br /><br />I've heard of this mysterious "NaNoWriMo" in forums and chat gatherings all over, but, to tell you the truth, I never really understood what it was. I just recognized it.<br /><br />That's why when I learned about what it actually is, I was estatic.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/cjaycontent/index.php?id=2">NaNoWriMo</a> stands for "National Novel Writing Month", and is a competition based on the production of prose.<br /><br />The thing is though, is that you have to write a 50,000 word story in a month. It's all about quantity, not quality, and that's what makes it fun. Even if you're some Joe Schmo that writes like a cat tied to a stick, you can compete with other artsy-fartsy posh-posh writers. I've always wanted to write a story, but I always quit after the eleventh page. Now that there's a competition where you can submit crap and still win, I'm interested.<br /><br />Perhaps I'll take a stab at it.
