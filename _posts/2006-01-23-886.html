Inside my mind:<br /><br />What if...<br /><br />Time stopped, and I was trapped in a period of very slow time? <br /><br />Whenever I think of this, I imagine the world around me turn grey, and sound stop. I view it as if it were an old film that crawls through the projector of the universe. The whole fantasy starts out in band class, as I look out the window, music becomes noise, and noise becomes a whisper, eventually being swallowed by the depths of eternity. Silence, and the colors around me go away, leaving only monochrome shells of once moving people. And I ask myself, what would I do?<br /><br />For a time, I usually walk around and think to myself, is this really happening? And occasionally, I see something interesting, like a family gathered around a dinner table, or a man throwing a coin into a Salvation Army container. I travel the world, as there are no more limits to space, traveling to random locations on Earth. The world lacks life, and as the color slowly fades from myself, I find myself drifting toward the band room again. I sit back down in my chair and think to myself of all the things that could have happened, but didn't. And I think of the people I could have met, but didn't. And I think of all kinds of things like this. Over time, I realize that maybe it really doesn't all matter anymore. If it ends, it ends. The world moves on.<br /><br />And when I finally realize this, color returns to the world and I again see the beige walls and the peachy tones of my peers. The sky turns a brilliant blue, and the ground a earthy tone of brown. And motion returns. The flick of the wrist returns to the band director, and slowly the Earth begins to again rotate. Sound returns, and the once empty air is now filled with pleasing vibrations. <br /><br />Life comes back, and I wake up.<br /><br />Was the whole scene created by my delusional mind, or is it a message to myself?
