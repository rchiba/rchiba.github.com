Today was unimpressive. But I did find something out...
<br />
<br />An average American conversation:
<br />American#1: Screw you, Pachke!
<br />American#2:Your retarded
<br />
<br />This kind of speech goes on forever sometimes. Oh well...
<br />
<br />Anyways, Alpha Leader #1 asked me how many signatures I had on my homework card. I said 0. As I was saying this, she mouthed some choice words at me. I pretend to not notice, but why do such a thing? Why ask me a question, and shun my answer? Why does she have to torture me even when I do my best. It's like she wants to torture me. What did I do? All I did was do all my homework, and all she does is insult me?!?!?!? It's outrageous. I am very angered now at her behavior. VERY ANGERED. I tried to keep my cool, but now she has angered me. She is probably going to kill me anyways... If I die soon, pin it on Alpha Leader #1 please. 
<br />
<br />You know what else I am angry about? I am angry about everyones comments about the bus driver, especially the person who sits right next to me. ALways complaining!!! WHY CAN'T YOU SIT DOWN AND BE CONTEMPT?!?!?!?!? The bus is fine!!! Sit down and SHUT THE F*** UP!!! but of course, while all of this is racing inside my mind, I keep silent... No one knows the trouble I go through everyday. MY MIND RACING, my body quiet. They go, "she drives like crap, it's pissing me off." That's is what they really say. And do you want to know how I want to respond to that ALPHA LEADER #1??? I WOULD LIKE TO SAY" COULD YOU DO ANY F****** BETTER??? DO YOU WANT TO DRIVE THE BUS??? WHY IS IT HER FAULT THAT THE BUS IS A BIT BUMPY??? HUH??? WHY DON'T YOU JUST WALK TO SCHOOL?!?!?!?!" And that is what is racing in my mind, but silent all the while....
<br />
<br />Now, I think that is all that I have to say. I am still very angry....
