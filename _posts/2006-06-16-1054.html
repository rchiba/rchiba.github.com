Another Friday.<br /><br />The weeks are passing by most quickly, summer will pass us all in the blink of an eye. New things are good, but savoring the present is sometimes better.<br /><br />I am going to take up a volunteer position at a local english/math learning center for advanced children. Not being particularly advanced myself, I hope that I won't be shunned by everyone as a simpleton.<br /><br />Tomorrow morning, 9AM sharp, at the pool. Things going on all the time, it's great that I don't have time anymore to just mope around and feel sorry for myself. By keeping active, I keep myself from stagnating.
