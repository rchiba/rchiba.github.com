I have to work tomorrow morning. Planned excursions for tomorrow seem exciting enough. We will meet me at the pool and we'll socialize for awhile. Then, all hell will break loose and we'll go to random places in his car (which usually means the library, a random place that I enjoy very much). Anything beyond that time is unknown at this moment. Since I'm sick, I should probably get to sleep. I'm sure I'll find at least one dead mole in the pool tomorrow. What fun.<br /><br />To the sleepinator (alternatively named: bed)!
