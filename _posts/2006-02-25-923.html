I've been enjoying my life more than usual. This can be attributed to the fact that the weekend means more time to engage in recreational pursuits. My engagement in these activities greatly enhances my mind. After a few hours of reading, drawing, modelling, and FPS-ing my mind is sharp, excited, and content. No longer is the world a hazy smear of color that blurs more and more as time passes. No longer is my life a sick and twisted land of dark, damp drear. Unfortunately, this euphoric state of existance is set to be eliminated with the coming of the week. Time slips past the loose grip I have on reality, and so my nonsensical macrocosm of sleep-deprivation begins.<br /><br />Although this little story has nothing to do with the above paragraph, I have to tell it, just because it deserves to exist.<br /><br />Today, I picked up the newspaper. The newspaper is a great thing. A useful tool to spread... well, news. I find the obituary page the best part of the newspaper. I see this page as the exemplification of human existance. What else can quantify something as "priceless" as a human life as an obituary page can? There, lives are treated like data. An organized log of the dead that records age, history, and surviving family, all in a paragraph of text. It is the summation of one's meager lifespan, and as a whole, the obituary is the summation of humanity's paradox. We see individual life as priceless, our own lives as something that should be cherished and remembered forever.<br /><br />But, in all truth, we will all be forgotten. And the only justification to keep living is to make a positive impact in the world, no matter how small it may be. People pretend that memories are meant to last. Through photographs, videos, journals, and diaries, we record ourselves so as time passes, our past does not fade.<br /><br />Such a hopeless attempt.<br /><br />Hopeless.<br /><br />And with a reminder that Monday is coming up, I enter my state of diluted consciousness and sadness.<br /><br />How odd. And about that story that I was going to tell you. Maybe it has something to do with it.<br /><br />The title of the column that caught my eye was, "42-year-old woman fears she will never find love".<br /><br />Here are some excerpts from the text:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"I am a single, never-married, 42-year-old academic woman who is undergoing a midlife reappraisal."<br /><br />"I have no friends."<br /><br />"I truly believe there is nothing to look forward to for the rest of my life"<br /><br />"When I die, no one will know what to do with any leftover family pictures or keepsakes. All of those things will be thrown away."<br /><br /></span><br />After reading the letter this anonymous person sent into this advice column, I didn't know how to feel. In a way, it made me feel very grateful for not living such a sad life, but in another way, the reminder that there are deplorable people out there in the world, walking the streets, working a job, and breathing the makes me feel dark inside. In yet another way, the text makes me feel angry. Angry at sob stories and "woe is me" tales from chronically depressed nuts.<br /><br />I'm so conflicted.
