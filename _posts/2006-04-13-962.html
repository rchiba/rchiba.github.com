The temperature in my room is too high for my taste at the moment. The fan is doing little to help the situation. My room is orderly, in fact, eerily orderly, but dust has become an issue. It seems to come out of nowhere. My fan is probably blowing more dust at me than air. Well, like I've said before, I'll get to cleaning when I'm feeling better, and when I have more time.<br /><br />But, it's all an excuse, a sham. A sick, wretched way of trying to ignore a problem that won't go away. The solution to the problem being a minor inconvenience that I, as a tired/lazy person, cannot stand to go through. I should stop putting it off and set a date. <br /><br />Speaking of time, I've figured out that I can make time. Due to a number of reasons, chiefly me obsessively targeting character animation as the "next thing to master", I am choosing to lose sleep to gain time. Novel idea, I know. Sometimes, I amaze myself (not really).<br /><br />This morning, looking at my French grade really didn't help the day get better. Two words that describe my French grade are, "Damage Control". The next few weeks of that class will be all about cleaning up the gigantic academic mess I've made. But, at least I can tell myself, "It can only get better from here". Nonetheless, I must be alert at all times, be ready for all surprises, and absorb as much French as I can. This is particularly difficult, as this is my first class of the day. <br /><br />Wonderful, wonderful sleep. Something that I often sacrifice, and something that I always covet.
