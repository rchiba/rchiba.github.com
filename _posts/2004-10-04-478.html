I'm still brooding over the fact that this 7 year old kid next door called me the "biggest nerd in the neighboorhood". It's really perturbing me because I can't comprehend why a child so young can harbor such a evil comment. I think she's lying about the whole neighboorhood calling me the "biggest nerd in the neighboorhood", but she could be telling me the truth. She's saying that everybody's saying it, to help justify her own comment. That doesn't justify any crap. You can lie in my face that everybody says that, or make up some lame excuse that everybody says that, but it won't justify a personal and malignant comment directed to your neighboor. It's really perplexing me, because I can't get over the fact that that little kid can do something that evil. Just think about what happens when she grows older. She'll probably end up as one of those often naive popular girls who make up every rational (and sometimes irrational) excuse for everything. You know, the kind that giggle and spread rumors at the same time. It's called multitasking to them, I call it a vile anti-social act.

<br />Anyways, tomorow is going to involve serious concentration. I'm coming home at 6PM, which leaves me 3 hours to do my homework. I usually have more than 3 hours of homework, which will mean that I will be ripping my hair out and looking up suicide up in the dictionary. Of course, I'm not going to kill myself because that totally defeats the purpose of doing my homework in the first place. Duh... Anyways, I have to take a bunch of tests tomorow and get all stressed out all day, and probably not have enough time, which will make me explode and then I'll get all angry, and I'll probably start babbling and shaking violently, then you know what happens next. The Explosion. Not just any explosion, it's wall to wall blood-organ frenzy of flesh flying every which way. Ok, maybe being gory won't make me feel any better about it, but it was worth a try.

<br />I have to research cell phones now. I must learn the best deals.... Must learn....
