I think that knowing is only half the battle.<br /><br />Or something like that. I read it all the time in books and inspirational brochures that they hand out at corporately sponsored sex-ed "convos" at my high school.<br /><br />Because one may know how to use equipment, but Alex's "it just works" saying does not apply. For example, my cellular telephone is dead. The screen has broken, the battery is worn out, and the speakers on it are busted. However much I know about how to fix phones, the Motorola customer "service" people are still going to hassle me by telling me that nothing is broken. <br /><br />So I sent my phone in a month ago, right? Well, they send it back, I look on the paper form the sent with the phone, and I see a little message neatly typed in a little box labled, "issue".<br /><br />The message reads, "No prblms".<br /><br />This frustrates me. My phone clearly lacks any capacity to ring, display information, or even connect to any cellular telephone service. Without working speakers, screen, and battery, this phone is just a lump of plastic and metal that takes up space. And to think, they "rigorously examine" and "test" each phone to make sure it meets "quality" standards. <br /><br />What kind of quality standards? Very bad quality standards.<br /><br />If they're going to keep letting crap like this end up in the hands of consumers, I'm never going to buy a cellular phone, or suscribe to cellular phone service ever again. The broadband phone connection I have right now is much better quality than that rubbish they sell at those seedy cell phone retailers. I find it degrading to call the Motorola hotline six, yes six, times to get them to send me a shipping label, and then have the "technicians" tell me that nothing is wrong with my phone. It's absolutely absurd!
