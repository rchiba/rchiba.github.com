Have you ever had the feeling where it seems like your friends are just being nice to but are not really your friends? It feels like that to me a lot.  I never get invited to ANYTHING!  There's like only one or two people who really act like my friends and one of them is Ryo.  No one ever talks to me.  I don't no if that's because I'm not social enough or something like that.  No one ever really pays any attention to me when I talk.  It's like I'm secluded from everyone and everything in the world except for my family.  Sometimes it feels nice because it's a lot more peaceful and I can concentrate on things better.  But otherwise, it really kind of angers me.  But the weird thing is I don't really want it to change.  I kind of like peace and quiet all around me every day.  It feels good to know that I have time to think instead of thinking about others all the time.  I normally am rather quiet anyway.  I think a lot.  But it's not about pointless things, it's about life in general.  Oh well.
