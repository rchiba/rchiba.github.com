Today my English teacher was absent.<br /><br />Thus, today's mood improved tenfold.<br /><br />The rumor is that she had a mental breakdown at "the Academy" that she teaches at before she comes to my school. I heard from a friend that she supposedly cursed at her students and went bonkers.<br /><br />I hope she doesn't come back.<br /><br />But, I know she will.<br /><br />Besides my English teacher's temporary demise, I've encountered a number of high-tension social situations today. <br /><br />One such situation was when I was rude to someone before lunch. Due to my unacceptable order to leave me alone (which can be attributed to Health class, which I have right before lunch) caused a girl that I know to hate me for the day.<br /><br />The following hours were full of heavy guilt and self-hate. That made my day worse by tenfold.<br /><br />But, a few hours ago, I sent an apology email to her explaining my situation and pleading for forgiveness.<br /><br />Luckily, I just recieved an email from her that stated her acceptance of my apology. <br /><br />Such a happy ending to a rather odd situation. The whole scenario demonstrates the importance of proper apologies. If I hadn't taken the time to write her my apology email, she would still hate me right now. Because I had taken evasive action to avoid future conflicts (by apologizing), I have secured a relationship that may or may not positively affect my life in the future.<br /><br />And now, I realize the importance of having other people "on your side" so to speak. No matter how weak, no matter how unimportant seeming, everyone is a contribution to the big pool of power that one must continuously harvest to survive in a cutthroat world. The philosophy is, the more people that you are on "good terms" with, the more people that can help you in a time of crisis. I find this concept facinating, as it seems to me like a sort of social insurance. All people should take great care in keeping relationships favorable. That's my two cents involving relationships, anyways. It's a rare thing to see me giving out relationship advice.<br /><br />Another thing that I've realized...<br /><br />Just like in books, people have distinct character roles that can either be flat or round. I know plenty of "shallow" people that seem rather lacking in depth, whether it be mental depth, emotional depth, social depth, or physical depth. Then again, I know quite a few people who are very "deep", so to speak. The people I attach onto so dearly and dependently are these people. Depth adds so much quality to one's overall human persona. <br /><br />In middle school, depth was difficult to find. Now that I'm in high school, I know so many more complicated, sophisticated, intelligent, and deep people. I think middle school was a bad experience because of this fact.<br /><br />Just something to be thankful about.
