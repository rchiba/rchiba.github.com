Nnng, hello blog-thing. Today I didn't go to school because I was sick. I've been feeling like utter, total, and complete crap all day. Right now I'm feeling a bit better, but I'm still a bit dizzy and sore. I haven't walked or exercised all day, and I'm trying not to feel guilty. It is very hard after eating a giant bowl of soup. Of course, I haven't had all that much all day, but still.... Anyways. My life in a nutshell right now. I don't want to type much, I'm feeling a wee bit hot again.
<br />~Amanda
