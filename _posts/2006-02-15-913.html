French class always makes me feel left out.<br /><br />Today was stage two of the sleep deprivation sequence. I'm not quite sure what happens on stage two, I don't quite remember, but all I know that it made me felt odd all day. Spurts of intense drowsyness hit me around every three hours, while the rest of the time I functioned at a slightly below optimum level. <br /><br />Wait, I think I was talking about French class.<br /><br />I begin to wander when my mind is so drenched in the muck of time, mood swings, entropy, etc.<br /><br />So I walk in. The room is chilling for me. People around me begin to converse with each other. Occasionally, someone will have a quip about how the room is too warm for them. For awhile, I sit there in my chair, dazed, staring at the wall, facinated by the fact that the room is different temperatures for different people. As I stare into the empty reaches of my field of vision, someone's rear end stops in my direct line of sight. A few seconds or so pass before I notice. My reaction time takes even longer. After half a minute, I respond, and shift my eyes away, trying to avert the possible attention that staring at someone's rear end could garner.<br /><br />My eyes finally respond to my command and move. Attention averted.<br /><br />Noise begins to slowly filter into my consciousness. The noise slowly becomes sound, then the sounds begin to mutate into words, that begin to clump together to form phrases. My comprehension ends there. In my early-morning dazed state, phrases cannot become sentences, nonetheless paragraphs.<br /><br />So the phrases formulate thoughts. I realize the conversation is between the teacher and the student in front of me. The student happens to be three years younger than me and in the same class. <br /><br />I'm too tired to be envious or resentful. <br /><br />But, I hear them talking about how she knows that people hate her. She's complaining to the teacher. I start to think to myself, "What a suck up.", but then I get hit by a wave of lethargy...<br /><br />And I think back to this website, that started around three years ago.<br /><br />And I think back to the things I've written in it.<br /><br />And I begin to realize that I was rather unintelligent three years ago.<br /><br />I sit in my desk, slouched over a pile of random French papers and writing utensils, and think to myself, "Who cares?"<br /><br />And it all made sense to me. Who cares if people hate you? Who cares of there is conflict in the world? Who cares about relationships? Who cares?<br /><br />And at that infinitesimally mundane, but powerful moment, a little part of my soul was freed. I felt better about all those years of stored anger, resentment, ill-will, rage. I realized that there will always be things that I don't like. So, I accepted. I accepted the fact that happiness isn't normal, accepted the fact that I'll never get enough sleep, accepted the fact that there will always be people better than me, and accepted the fact that my death is inevitable.<br /><br />I figured it out, and I felt a warm, pure, happy sensation.<br /><br />And the rest of the day, I was happy on the inside.<br /><br />So, why did I start off this post with "French class always makes me feel left out."?<br /><br />Everyone else just kept talking about how the room was too hot.
