I was never a very musical person.<br /><br />From the beginning, I was opposed to music. I ignored and tried to dismiss all music throughout my middle school life. My thought was, music was distracting and ate up time. I mean, after all, music is just coordinated noise. What's the big deal? Finding music to be a trivial matter, I focused my efforts on writing and creation. Last year, my friend gave me a taste of a few good bands. He gave me a CD and I put it in the portable CD player. The CD, spinning like some hypnotic wheel of doom.<br /><br />Euphoria and joy started pulse throughout my mind. It's unbelievable how amazing something is until you try it out for yourself.<br /><br />So, I went home and thought about it. Let's try this music thing out. I mean, it's just coordinated noise, how bad could it be? I bought a few CD's and listened to them constantly. Every second was bliss. It wasn't noise anymore. The music was being absorbed by me, and I savored every second of it. <br /><br />With that in mind, I find myself sitting here in front of a stack of about 18 CD's on my desk, a locked suitcase beside me holding about 50 of these things, a hard drive chock full of oldies, and 2 stereos in my room. Not to mention the six speakers and countless headphones that are scattered all over the room. I believe that music is an addiction. You buy a CD and you just can't get enough. You go to the store or download some more music. Constantly clashing feelings overwhelm you as you get bored and the euphoric rhythm starts to wear out. Sometimes it wants to make me start at the beginning, and forget about music. <br /><br />I thought I was wrong when I put that fateful CD in my friend's CD player, and I still do. Music is overwhelming my life. And so, from beginning to end, I'm still stubborn as a mule. Unwilling to appreciate the euphoria of such a flowing and natural drug.<br /><br />I was never a musical person, and I don't think I ever will be.
