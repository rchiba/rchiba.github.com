Always, with the talk about the time. <i>What time is it?</i> And I really don't know because it's always changing. In my eyes, it's speeding by too quickly to talk about. In someone else's, it may be plodding along. And our interpretation of time can be so different. But, yesterday night seems like a few minutes ago. I find it hard to believe that it's already Thursday, the day before Friday.<br/><br/><i>Friday</i><br/><br/>The day I've been waiting for for the past five days. Because you start swerving if you don't look far enough on the road. Goals. My QuizBowl coach posed the question, <i>"What is your goal for this year?"</i> on a paper notecard (to be filled out for information purposes). I really couldn't come up with a singular goal for this year. I don't even know where I'm heading. There are tasks, sure, but my only goals at the moment are getting through these tasks. One step at a time. Goals like :<i>"Getting to Friday."</i> come into mind. <br/><br/>But, on the card I wrote, <i>"None. Philosophy: Go with the flow"</i>.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure if that's true or not, but that was the only statement I could think of that would satisfy the prompt.<br/> <br/>I can't think right now. My pencil is yellow and black. I can feel the little grooves between my teeth with my tongue. Blah. I really can't think about my thoughts today. Memory. It's just. It's going away. Sleepless nights lead to fatigue. Does it come from an ordinary schoolweek? No, it comes from me. It's my fault. Gah! I'm pulling my hair out thinking about how stupified I am right now. STUPID STUPID STUPID. I can't think. Work, tasks, just too many.... things. They're all there, all at once. And I can't see any of them clearly. Blurry. Primitive. I'm seriously not able to comprehend these things that are being asked of me. My senses. All not coming thoroshgoadn fofofoofooooÂ
