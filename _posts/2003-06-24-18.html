I havn't eaten lunch yet and I am pretty hungry. About 30 minuites ago, I walked my dog and biked around the neighborhood. It was pretty tiring. My neighborhood is next to a cornfield and is pretty wide open, but not in the middle of no-where.Its hot and alittle breezy, but not much. This is the total opposite to what Japan is experiencing right now. In Japan, it is the rainy season with hardly any sunshine. The sunshine at my house is pretty harsh and you can't go far without geting tanned. It is a little weird realizing that I am writing to no one for this blog will probably never be seen to any eyes besides me. I proped up my fan on the computer desk so my butt won't sweat as much. It feels soooo good on my face right now. I feel a bit sticky though because all the dried sweat is making me sticky. I am pretty bored and bored I am. I know I will be urgently waiting for summer when school starts but it is pretty boring. I guess in reality you can never be satisfied with anything, ever. Well, thats the case for me anyways. I feel exceptionaly wierd talking and ranting away with no sound, only the taps of the keyboard to signify that I am communicating. Weird indeed...
