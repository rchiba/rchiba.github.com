I will now try to emulate the intricate and mysterious language patterns of an ordinary proletariat in today's society.<br />-----------------------------------<br />Fuckin' Ay'! Today was gay as a faggot fucktard that fucks. My homie, JJ, tried to crap out on a shitty deal on some fucking Mary Jane, but some kike took our fucking stash and fucked it all up. Shit! That was some fucked up stuff, man. Lata, we was pimpin' some ass-hoe some shit and shit happened! Fuck! We ran to like, our 'hood and chilled at JJ's crib, who's a ass fuck who can't fuck shit! Shit happens when you fuck shit up, but, shit, my gay lesson is that some faggot gays can fuck stuff up, so shut the hell up and don't be gay, fucker. Signing the fuck out...<br /><br />Your fuckin' awesome as hell homie,<br /><br />-M.K. Daddy<----OMG! Shit! I can't even speell my fucking first name! Fuckin' shit!<br />------------------------------------<br /><br />Oh how dearly we need Marx and his crew to educate these poor proletariats.<br /><br />Enough about communism and whatnot. More about other things.<br /><br />Finding people who parallel the intelligence demonstrated above is easy, but exterminating them from society is hard. First of all, any economy needs these people. By ripping them off, cleverly hiding small print on credit card contracts, and by selling them services and products, we all profit. If we were to exterminate this corrupted strain of people, we would all suffer price hikes and increased competition in the job market. I suppose it would be beneficial for me to let these folks live their simple, debt-filled lives, but why not eliminate a few for future purposes? I mean, in the future, money will be obsolete and everyone will coincide together in ultimate harmony. On the other hand though, we could just create a devastating nuclear winter that slowly kills off our species and others. Well, for now, let's pretend that we won't all kill each other. The following are options for eliminating inferior strains of people: bridge pushing, car hitting, cannon shooting, mustard gassing, food poisoning, water poisoning, microwaving, brick throwing, mech crushing, stick impaling, KGB, scalpel slicing, laser cutting, cloth formaldehyding, blade dicing, hammer whomping, boulder rolling, grenade exploding, flag burning, bat whacking, face slapping, building jumping, snipers, and dish soap.<br /><br />Of course, there's ethics to be taken into consideration. There's also supply and demand. We demand lots of lower-strained people, but we also have a large supply of them. I suppose by keeping them where they are, balance in the universe is achieved. Thus, we can all continue to practice fung shuei and meditate in zen gardens. So there I go again. I reasoned out my irrational ideas. Pft, my ideas are always stupid.
