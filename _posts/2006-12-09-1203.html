Spent the morning doing my English project. <br /><br />Cutting out rounded squares of paper and coloring them for a 5" by 3" booklet on Moby Dick doesn't make for the most exciting weekend. <br /><br />Later, I got on Second Life for a little bit and chatted with a group of "peacekeeping" German militants in my favorite sandbox. I don't think the sandbox is my favorite anymore. It's filled with newbie garbage, and the lag is intense. Boxes with animated .gifs of Beavis, physics-enabled houses that haven't been linkled together (resulting in a pile of physics-enabled rubble), and giant, rotating smiley faces, you get the idea. The place is a dump.<br /><br />The "German Army" people told me that they fight for the rights of Germans throughout SL. The guy trying to recruit me told me that they are a "peaceful" army and that they are the ones "who always get attacked". It's always fun to meet people full of bullshit, especially online. It's obvious they're finding an excuse to carry around big guns and look cool. I joked around with them for a little bit and left the simulator, wondering what ever happened to the clean, fast sandbox I enjoyed two months ago. <br /><br />Unfortunately, after logging out of Second Life, I was lured into clicking the Wolfenstien icon on my desktop. A three hour frag fest ensued. 400+ kills. Now my right eye hurts, and my ring finger is sore from hitting the "throw medpack" button so many times. I feel guilty for indulging myself. I should have been studying for finals. I plan to do that tomorrow.
