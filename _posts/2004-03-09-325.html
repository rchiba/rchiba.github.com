Writing is hard when you SPENT 3 HOURS ON ART HOMEWORK!
<br />Average Yo reporting,
<br />Anyways, I am typing this before the school bus comes. So, I have to be quick. Anyways, I have started art. It seems fun, a bit time consuming though. I mean, drawing isn't my best subject, if you know what I mean. Also, I'm going to get new in-line skates for my birthday. I need a pair of those. I mean, I have to wear my dad's and even his skates don't fit me. Also, I spent 3 hours on art homework last night. We have to draw a muscularly "exaggerated" body and put a cartoonish face on it. Of course, I chose Kirby (that pink blob that I idolize). Luckily my dad has this Arnold Schwarzenegger ( I spelled it right!) magazine with all of these pictures in it that I could use. I went to various kirby fansites to capture the minute details in kirby's face, and then to top it all off, spent forever coloring it. Pink is a hard color to find nowadays.
<br />
<br />Anyways, in math everyone got a pretty bad grade on the test that we took a few days ago. Because of this, our teacher is going to let us take another test to try to help us boost our grades. This test is going to take place today. On the original test, I got a B-. Is that good, or bad? I mean, according to PSI standards, that's pretty good. Of course, I'm not a presumeably stupid idiot, but I don't know what to make out of a B-. Anyways, I hope I do good on the test that is going to take place today, because if I don't I will feel bad. (writing on my blog always helps me do good on tests for some reason).
