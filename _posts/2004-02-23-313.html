Average Yo reporting.
<br />I went to Devin's house today and Devin, Karl, and I TRIED to work together. 4 hours later this is what we got done:
<br />1. A Crappy Map that Devin drew Pixel by Pixel
<br />2. A corny story that I made up and Devin want's to scrap it
<br />3. We wasted a ton of black ink trying to resize a crappy map that Devin drew pixel by pixel.
<br />I think that that was kind of a warm-up. I guess we weren't really working. Next time will be different. I hope we can get this done because we just can't work together efficiently. I mean, Devin was on the floor laughing at my story (I personally didn't think my story wasn't so bad) and Karl was talking about going home (It seemed that he lived in the Ritz, the way he was saying it). Most of the time, Devin tied up the computer because he was talking to his friends on that evil, useless AIM thing. I those things. Anyways, no time to talk, need time to make up all that lost time at Devin's house. I think we have scheduled a next meeting this Sunday. Well, bye...
