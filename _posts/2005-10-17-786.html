I must be going blind.<br /><br />I can't see what's ahead of me anymore. Since I've started using my PDA as a personal information manager/calendar, I've been confused on things going on. Having a machine let you be stupid and lazy, well... does just that.<br /><br />It makes you stupid and lazy. I realized that in my math class today. I forgot my calculator, and bad things happened. I ended up asking the people around me how many 7's were in 21 and how to multiply 7 by 9. Flailing madly and cursing, I somehow managed to finish my homework without a trusty little computer to do all the busywork for me.<br /><br />Situational irony can be found in the fact that I am now using my graphing calculator to help me memorize vocabulary for French. Now, isn't that funny.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I didn't think it was that amusing either.
