Because it is the end of the year, everyone's talking about how many days of school is left.<br /><br />Sometimes, it bothers me. I think it is bad to excessively look forward to time passing and something happening in the future. If you don't enjoy what's going on in the present, what happens if you die tomorrow? I mean, sure, summer is next week, and that counting down days is exciting. But, one must realize that every day that passes is another day closer to an accident, another day closer to a catastrophe, another day closer to death. High school may be over for many, but then where to? College, then work, retirement, then death. I find life so much more manageable if I focus on enjoying today, not planning to enjoy tomorrow. Make use of the events at hand, that's my philosophy.<br /><br />In middle school, I was rather stupid. Sometimes, I would have lists of good days that would happen in the future, lists of half-days, holidays, birthdays, celebrations, etc. And every day, I would gripe about how that day wasn't a day on my list. Complain about things that happen in the present. Living a life that is predominantly spent waiting for things isn't very fulfilling.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I have no idea when I changed. I have no idea <b>if</b> I have even change. Even today, I complain about the present and gaze into the bright future. I know on the inside that if I paint today positive, I'll be much less depressed. But, I still paint the present dark colors and see sunny windows as openings to a forbidden paradise. If only I could realize that the windows are just transparent barriers that block me from a wonderful world I'm already in. In this sense, there is no balance in my life. I tend to isolate things and then favor one over the other. <br /><br />I felt better while I walked around school today. Either I'm sleeping more, my workload is reduced, I'm content with myself, or a combination of the three. I can't really tell, my whole life seems to mesh together, with the earlier end trailing off at around middle school. I hardly remember the beginnings of middle school. I remember more 4th grade than I do 6th grade. Perhaps I blocked out my feelings of separation. Having moved here right before starting 6th grade, I must have had a terrible time adjusting to my peers. Male teachers, who would have thought? Moving from Alabama, the male teachers in 6th grade startled me just as much as the snow.<br /><br />Right now, I'm looking into my future and I'm seeing myself as a writer in the school newspaper. The newspaper teacher has wanted me to join the newspaper team ever since I took Journalism class last year. I enjoyed the class, but my schedule, as well as my aversion to the teacher (I really don't like sports, and she covered the sports beat when she worked for the town newspaper. I know I'm prejudiced, so shoot me) kept me from joining newspaper this year. Today, she approached me in the hallways and I did my whole schpeel on how I would do it if my schedule was more open. Unfortunately, the my counselor was down the hallway, so she walks down, cajoles the counselor into changing my schedule, and voila. I'm in newspaper. Magic? Fate? My journalism teacher trying to drag me into newspaper? You tell me.<br /><br />I don't think it'll be too bad though. Positive aspects are numerous, even though the social antagonism involved in working for the school newspaper is going to be heavy and hard. I don't think I'll have to adjust much, since I already type posts every day. But, journalism is full of rules and restrictions, which is going to make work challenging. On the other hand, I'll be able to bring some tech expertise to the crew. My dream is to someday convert the four page sports section in the school newspaper to a four page technology and editorial section. <br /><br />The future looks slightly less dim, so I might as well look forward to now. Not as much "look forward" though, but more downward, or not even looking at all.<br /><br />I see my feet.
