I hate reading my English book because I always spend more time reading it than doing any of my other homework. I read the story, think about it a little, then randomly flip through the pages to another eyecatching story. I read it, then move on to another story. It continues until I realize how stupid I am to spend so much time reading fiction, or until I realize that there's still a pile of other homework on my desk. <br /><br />The most memorable story for today was an excerpt from a book that chronicles the atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima. I've read it many times before. During reading days at middle school, I would read the whole book over and over. It was the only nonfiction on the book dolly. Cover to cover. I must have read that particular chapter at least fifteen times. And it never stops intriguing me. In the book, the terror and suffering comes across as completely fictional. Like a bad nightmare, or a science fiction novel. But, to think, there are actual people who lived through the vaporization of a whole city. Actual people who breathe and think, who could come up to me and shake my hand, and tell me these stories that are so much more than stories to them.<br /><br />It's disturbing to think that such a enormously violent has become something to be found in short pieces of old, dry English book. New Orleans wasn't vaporized by a expanding ball of flaming inferno. But, what if it was? How long would we remember before it would happen again?<br /><br />Tomorrow I get to go on a field trip to Purdue with my AP Chemistry peers. It's a friendly change to my routine.
