Hello, average yo here.
<br />I haven't been updating because of chores, mathcounts, and getting angry at my sister. But those are just excuses. I guess you have more to write about when people at school make complete moronic fools out of themselves. Ahhh, humans are so predictable. My sister opened her present early. I hate my sister, she is such a weakling. Couldn't even wait a few days. Oh well, I hope she feels guilty on Christmas. 
<br />
<br />Well, my mathcounts game is going well. We are playing a questionaire kinda thing on a message board. I have alot of points and am dominating the competition. Yay. I still don't understand alot of things though.
<br />
<br />Anyways, Amanda is complaining again. I should email her. I can't talk to her because I deleted to freaking AOL messenger crappalicious program. That program is the most annoying, idiotic, useless program I have ever had the discontent to use, see, and ratify. That program does more harm than it helps. Stupid idiot girls sending me messages. A window always pops up occasionally that says, "Do you accept this message from, soanso?". And I'm like "GO AWAY YOU FREAKISH MONKEY ANIMALS!, I HATE YOU!" So that is why I deleted AOL. I hate AOL. America online, hahaha. Their commercials suck unsuspecting middle age parents and tortures their kids. Good thing I subscribed to MSN. I feel sorry for all those AOL users.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I better get going with emailing Amanda. She is the only person I can talk to who understands the things I talk about. The people who sit at my table at lunch blabber endlessly about trivial subjects like "video games", and "gangs" and what not. Those monkeys are trapped in a perpetual fountain of stupidity like no other. It's like they don't have any sense of intellect anymore.
<br />
<br />Well, that's all for today, seeya later.
