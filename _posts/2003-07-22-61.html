Hello,
<br />Another blog session with me. I was just writing about stuff and my mom interrupted me to go walk the dog to the garage. So, I had to delete the previous stuff.
<br />Anyways, I am angry right now. I got that jiggly feeling like on the edge of emotion. Like a bubble about to pop. If someone pokes at me anymore times, I might just pop. My dad got on my nerves today because he said to give up any entertainment what-so-ever. I took a vow to not buy games, so thats what I did. I still cringe when I go to a b-day party and everyone talks about how many games they get everyday and how much money they have. Always cringing because each time I realise that I have to stay true and stick to the free stuff. Then, I had to give up my sitting lifestyle to "work out". That took out alot of enjoyment out of my life. Now after all that, all I got is the internet, Right? Well, my dad thinks I spend too much time here. He thinks I should stop. STOP. Pretty serious if you ask me. I am dependent on internet for my soul my enjoyment. I have learned much from the internet and I am close to it, like a pet or something. If you take it away from me, this is the last straw. I have no point in life. Nothing to live for, nothing to do. After that, my life is work work work work. I am only 13!!! Can't I have a life? Ever heard of entertainment??? I don't have any after my dad makes me get off. I will surely get on again, one way or another. You can't separate me with the internet. You can't. Maybe you can, but I will give a fight. This is my entertainment and don't take it away from me. Please dont. All my friends may have more entertainment, but I dont care. As long as I have my internet. That is all that I ask for. Isn't that enough? 
<br />
<br />Wow, I feel better now that I expressed my feelings. I still feel like a bubble, but a more rigid one. My dad is angry at me and I need to get him not angry. I dont know how. I gotta think.... think... think...think...
