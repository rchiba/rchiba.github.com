I took the third sip.<br /><br />A sip of a liquor so foul that one cannot drink it without conjuring up images of hellish fires. <br /><br />No, I was not drinking antifreeze. Yes, I was drinking apple cider.<br /><br />I open the fridge to smell the alluring scent of spiced apple. My hand snakes its way toward the fragrant container of brown liquid. I stop myself. <br /><br />I know that this apple cider is old, and possibly nausea/food illness inducing. But, the smell, it forces me to pick up the container. The cool air from the refridgeration unit makes me even more mindless. To think, I've drank this liquid twice before, and twice I have suffered the wrath of foodborne illness. <br /><br />Time is running out. I'm reaching a crossroads, where I have to make a decision. Will I trudge on with false hope that somehow this apple cider magically turned new again, or will I run away, cowering in terror from the horror of it all? The cold air in the fridge turns tepid. Time to choose.<br /><br />I take the container out, and I pour myself a glass of apple cider. The fragrance continues to tempt me, pull me toward my ultimate doom. Like a primal instinct taking over, I pick up the glass.<br /><br />I take the third sip.<br /><br />And bad things start to happen. My digestive system goes haywire, and it's curtains for me. <br /><br />Lesson learned: Apple cider does NOT magically turn new, however much you want it to.
