I just want to cry or jump off of a high building, or both at the same time.<br /><br />For the last hour or so, I have stared at one chemistry problem trying to understand it. I have yet to do so. And I continued on for an hour, in a desperate attempt to comprehend the words that sat in front of me.<br /><br />The words taunt me. <br /><br />And I tell myself that if I stare at it long enough that the answer will appear before me. But, that's never how it works. An hour. Of my sleep. Or my life. Gone. Because I'm incompetent and have defective critical thinking.<br /><br />And allthewhile knowing that I'll come to school tomorrow and everyone besides me will have figured it out, saying that the worksheet is easy. And every time someone does that to me tomorrow, I'll feel like a part of me just withered away and died. Because every second of that hour I spent staring aimlessly at the stupid problem could have been an hour working on my endless amounts of other homework, or the seconds could have been spent cleaning my room, or spent drawing, or spent sleeping, or spent preparing for my tests. <br /><br />But, that's not how it happened.<br /><br />Now, I will forever have to live with the fact that I wasted that hour of my life. Dedicated it to a lost cause. Dedicated it to something that should be very easy and that everyone will understand, except me.<br /><br />And still, I sit here and get angrier and more frustrated about that one hour. And my frustration gets me frustrated even further. To think that the time I spend here typing this out could be time spent typing my English paper out, or a number of other things that have to be done tonight, besides sleeping. And usually, I feel better about things after I type them out, but right now I'm just feeling helpless and angry and confused and lost and disappointed and sad. For that one hour, I will feel guilty for five hours. For that one hour, it is not only an hour lost, but hours off of my life from the inevitability that my death will be instigated by myself.<br /><br />It's futile really. The whole thing. The whole thing that surrounds me. The thing that I would like to call reality. I'm a mess. I could see myself killing myself at some point in my life. Eventually. Probably during middle age, or something like that. If I get this mind-racketed from a chemistry problem, think about how I would respond to a deadline for thousands of such problems.<br /><br />Things seem like big mess. Things sometimes clean themselves up, but entropy rules my life. Right now at least. And I still have to finish that one chemistry question. <br /><br />It sits there. On my table. That question makes me feel bad.<br /><br />It watches me.
