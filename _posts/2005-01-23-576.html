You've probably heard the saying, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." Well, I've got a news flash for people who are slackers. When you face reality, the real slogan is, "No work and all play makes Jack a high school reject who can't function, or contribute, in a competitive society." Yes, constantly working might make you dull, but isn't being dull better than being unable to contribute to society? I become quite shaken when I find slackers who justify their "slackeryness" by saying that work is "boring". Everything has to be fun for them. Their only purpose in life is to enjoy it. There are times when you have to NOT have fun in order to do something for your future. School may not be "fun", but sacrifices have to be made. Deal with your "non-fun" homework.

<br />Anyways, Ryan's father did something very demeaning to me yesterday. Ryan and I were just comming back from the library. We were in a small cramped red car. Ryan handed me a book that instructed you on how to draw anime characters. He showed me this fat slob that you could draw called "burger boy" (how original). As I handed back the book back to Ryan, the page turned and Ryan's father happened to glance at the book. He said, "No wonder he was looking at the book, he was looking at the girls." The page that was showing showed you how to draw scantilly-clad females. I was a bit shocked by the comment, but restrained myself. Ryan tried to explain my predicament, but his father interrupted, "I never said that there was anything wrong with looking at girls!"
<br />
<br />Now, if you haven't noticed, this all happened in a matter of minutes. I was surprised even more about the second comment. How could he accuse me of such a thing, not let me explain, and then condone something he isn't supposed to? My mind was rushing with frustration and anger, but the car was silent. In my mind, I thought, "How dare he accuse me of such a lurid act?! Why, if only I wasn't a subordinate..."
<br />
<br />All this got me riled up, and when I get riled up, I think. The thing that is wrong with religion is that no one follows it. Yes, the lord might forgive your sins, but then what is the point? How can people like Ryan's father call themselves religious when he accuses people, and then condones looking at women in inappropriate ways?
<br />
<br />I'm probably exaggerating, but that's because I've been frustrated with this situation ever since I got off of that small red car. I'm frustrated.
