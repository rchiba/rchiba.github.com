I've gotten past the brunt of the storm.<br /><br />Now, it's a matter of time before I'm better, in school, and reading a poem about suicide bombers.<br /><br />You know, it's really odd how things so far away... seem far away. I mean, with this new technology, telecommunications advancements, journalistic ideals, and televised newscasts, one can be attached to the world, like everything going on in the world is a big mesh, and you're the one trapped inside of it. <br /><br />But, unfortunately (or fortunately), it's all an illusion. A trick of our primal mind and the telecom giants.<br /><br />Everyone knows about suicide bombers, IED's, world hunger, civil wars, dictators, and economic strife. But it's all so far away. At least to me. They're things that one can sit at home and see on the television, but turn off and go back to eating dinner. It's something that you see from an electric box, not something someone is going through across the globe. For all I, we, and you know, the stuff being spit out of the news could all be just a bad dream. The people I know at school, have no idea. I have no idea. I don't think anyone has any spec of an idea of how life is like away from comfort.<br /><br />There's this one kid in my English class that is just clueless as to what the darker side of the world is like. Just to satisfy my sick mind, I have this urge to beat a cat to a bloody pulp in front of her face, because her cluelessness bothers me so.<br /><br />But, I suppose it's not a matter of if she'll see death and destruction, but a matter of when.<br /><br />But, who cares? How I see it, the pain doesn't matter until it hits.
