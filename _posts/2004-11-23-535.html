I look back at myself, at my last post, and wonder what I was thinking. Practice went well, and I think it was a positive experience.
<br />
<br />Anyways, tomorow is the last day until Thanksgiving. I'm excited, and so is everyone else.
<br />
<br />Now, to talk about Journalism class. I hate it. Everyone is better than me at writing "news". I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I signed up for jounralism. Now I'm stuck in a class that interviews people and writes "news". Any creativity included is stifled by a set of rules that are written in a "stylebook". I would like to announce that Journalism class is a waste of my time. I can't write crap, and I don't want to spend a hour reading newspapers. Sheesh...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I plan to submit my MEDIOCRE feature on this sports star I don't even care about. Stupid sports. I hate sports.
<br />
<br />So much hate, where is the love? I guess it's not a lovely dovely day. Tomorow will be. I hope.
