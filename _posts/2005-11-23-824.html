I heard something on NPR a few days ago, three days ago to be exact, and it has been bothering me since.<br /><br />The radio program was an interview of a man who was trying to understand and write an article on what "philanthropy tourism" was, and so in his quest to discover what "philanthropy tourism" was, he went to a village in a poor African nation. This nation I cannot remember, but I do remember what this man spoke of, and his recollection of his experiences.<br /><br />He went to Africa not really knowing what he was getting into. He really didn't think all that much about it until he was a few minutes away from the village, in a humanitarian aid van.<br /><br />So, he gets there and makes a speech to the people of this impoverished village. He reminds them, at the aid workers' request, that not all white men would come with cash. And still, he didn't know what he was getting himself into.<br /><br />While in the village, he found an injured, old man who had trouble walking and moving around because he was severely injured and infected in the leg.<br /><br />The man being interviewed decided to pay for an operation that the injured, old man needed. The operation cost $100. These 100 dollars would give back the injured man mobility, hope, and purpose. Basically, these 100 dollars would give him life. <br /><br />Now, this is the thought that struck me so. If a life is worth 100 dollars, are we, as inhabitants of post-industrialized nations, spending our money wisely?<br /><br />Think of everything in your house that costs more than 100 dollars. Your computer, your television, your excess clothing, jewelry. There are quite a bit of these kinds of things in everyone's home, I imagine. Then, picture each of those things that are worth 100 dollars or more as having a face. Having life.<br /><br />Those faces are the faces of people who could have lived, but didn't because humanitarian aid did not get to them fast enough. These are the faces of people who are not poor because of their performance as humans, but poor by the luck of draw. These are the faces of people who ask for so little, but recieve even less.<br /><br />And so I look at myself, and I feel sick to my stomach. I bought 20 dollars worth of pens and markers. And to think, that was one fifth of a person that could have lived, but didn't. I have a computer, nice clothing, and a television. That's 10 people that could have been saved. There are a number of things all around me that I really don't "need". <br /><br />I say I "need" them, but when you look at everything relatively, isn't life the most important object, if you can even call it that? Isn't sheer existance the driving force in everything? What would be the world if you were dead? What would be a broadband connection after death? <br /><br />I understand that money can't necessarily buy life, or happiness. One can throw infinite money at any third world country, and it'll most always be diverted to corrupt officials, or wasted in meaningless inefficiency. But, sometimes, money can buy life. Like the man who gave 100 dollars to the ailing man in Africa. As odd as it may sound, he bought back the old man's life.<br /><br />And, in the same way, money can buy happiness. When you play a video game, doesn't that make you happy? When you turn on the television and watch your favorite show, doesn't that make you happy? When you put on nice clothes, you must feel happy.<br /><br />But, which would you rather buy? Someone else's life, or your own happiness?<br /><br />I'm sick of everyone, including myself, buying the later of the two.<br /><br />This nation is full of people who would not think twice about buying a new gadget or gizmo for 100 dollars or more. <br /><br />We call life priceless, so why are we ignoring the starvation and pestilence of those overseas?<br /><br />Is the only "priceless" life our own?
