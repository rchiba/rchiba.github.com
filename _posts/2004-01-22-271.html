This is the Average Yo,
<br />Anyways, today was interesting (and like alot of other days, I am overloaded on homework). Miles Hunley tried to demonstrate his intellect today, only miserabley failing. Well, he can't help it. It's the society he's brought up in. He is rewarded with attention whenever he does something stupid. Consequently, his brains core intent in life is to do stupid things and therefore, get attention. That's my thesis statement on Miles Hunley. I don't care who reads this because I am entitled to my opininons because of this great country called the USA.
<br />
<br />Well, there was a note put in my band teachers desk and she read it to us. It was very angry and it talked about how stupid alot of things going on in band are. It was very insulting and whoever wrote it deserves to paint themselves in black for a week. I really hate those kind of people. If they don't like the things in band, they should just quit. Maybe it was some stupid 6th grader who doesn't know they can quit. I really hate people who protest things that they should be thankful for.
<br />
<br />Also, another topic of discussion for today is the public bathrooms at school. No one seems to have the intellect or mental capability to flush their own waste down the drain. It seems as though I go to a school built for utter morons who refuse to even flush their cr*p down the toilet. I mean, people spent years perfecting the amazing invention of the toilet and people at my school don't even take advantage of it. Consequently, the bathrooms are always stagnant with the powerful smell of urine and feces. By my standards, that is poor quality bathrooms. The people at school don't even wash their hands. I think they should put a smallpox virus on a desk and see how many morons get it. That would be funny...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to eat dinner. I should put on my "to do list" to write some terms of service. The only problem is that I have NO time whatsoever. I really need to invent a time machine.
