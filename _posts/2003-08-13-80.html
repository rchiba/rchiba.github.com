Ok, I just woke up and school is in about 2 hours. I am glad about all the teachers because they are nice. I am afraid about algebra though. I guess, I'll get used to it. I hope I have time to write in this journal when I get back from school. I hope... hope.. hope.. hope..
<br />Do I hear an echo??? Ohhh NOOOooo!!!!
