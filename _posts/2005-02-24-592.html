It is so close to Friday. It's one of the first Friday's worth waiting for. Before, diving had made the weekend just as hard as the week days. Now, my life has become a bit easier. I've been invited to Jordan's surprise party.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm not sure if I should even go. I mean, I'll probably be alienated and alone, but it's a chance to network. A risk perhaps. But hey, I'm a man of risk. <br /><br />I did well on my French test, and that's probably why I'm so upbeat today. Plus the fact that Ryan gave me "LUV 2 BLOG" post it notes on the bus. Even though they are purple, I still enjoy using them. It's a big deal to me. Hardly anyone gives me presents, ever. It's touching... <br /><br />Anyways, why is purple the symbol of homosexuality? Purple is a color of royalty, a color of rich aristocrats. How does this relate to homosexuality? If I wore hot pink to school, would people think I'm a freak? Why do we as humans represent ideas and objects with different wavelengths of light? Enough of my stupid ranting.<br /><br />I'm tired, again. Time to recharge....
