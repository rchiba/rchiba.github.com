I was watching an old Harry Potter movie on the Disney channel a few minutes ago. My excuse is that it just happened to be on when I was brushing my teeth. The actors looked so young in the movie. I believe that the actors are the same age as me. I pictured myself at that age, and it was hard. But, although the mental image of myself fades away, I remember when the movie was in theaters, I remember when the promotional posters were glossy and vibrant. The cardboard cutouts of the characters weren't dusty collectors items being sold online, they were useful tools to further the profits of the movie. I walked into the movie theater and watched that movie, the air was cold, and the seats were stale. I remember all of this, but I cannot recall ever being as young as the actors on screen.<br /><br />It's very odd that I never remember myself. I look into mirrors of all sorts all throughout the day, and have been for the past sixteen years. There have been pictures of me, proof that I did indeed pass through the gauntlet of time. The old video camera in the basement has taped footage of me when I was nine. All of this proof, and I can't remember? It frightens me because it makes me question if I really know myself.<br /><br />When I look at myself in the mirror, I sometimes try to imagine how I will look in the future, as an elderly gentleman, as a college student, as a middle-aged depressed slave to society, trying to see myself and figure out who I may become. In all of my fictional renderings of myself, each is different. Different because I have this scary power to decide which renderings of me will become reality, and which will be discarded in the recycle bin of fate. Will I be the suicidal and realistic guy in the khaki pants, or will I be the idealistic beatnik with a colorful wardrobe of turtlenecks? I wield this power to meddle with my future, and I can choose. Little decisions I make every day culminate to create the final product. People say there is no "right" outcome, but some must be better than others, right? And it's so much like a tree. There are branches, and branches on the branches, and leaves on the branches, and veins in the leaves, and smaller veins on the veins. An almost endless choice of outcomes, and even the choice of not having an outcome.<br /><br />Is it really even a choice, or does it all "just happen"? I hate to think that my life will "just happen", although that's how I'll feel when I'm old and ready to die. I'll think to myself, "It happened. So, I guess this is the end." <br /><br />Perhaps I'll even read these words I write to myself now, and hate myself for taking every day for granted.
