My post last night was too emotional, but I have every right to be angry. Every right to be sad and distraught. Yet my emotional wall keeps those feelings from tearing me apart. My spirit is at an all time low I believe, and I wonder if these wounds in my heart will ever heal.
<br />"Now as I lay me down to rest,
<br />there is sadly, no mistake
<br />my soul my spirit broken to pieces,
<br />I know I'll never wake.
<br />So as I die in my bed tonight,
<br />cry no tears for me,
<br />instead burn me and scatter my ashes,
<br />finally, finally, free."
<br />~Amanda
