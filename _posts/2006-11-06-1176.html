I feel attacked. <br /><br />By who? I can't see. <br /><br />I sat there in the hallway after school, waiting to interview someone. Waiting for swimming practice to start so I could interview the swimming coach. In the wide, open hallway my books are sprawled out on the floor. I rest against some wooden trophy case. Remembering diving freshman year, remembering the ice cream machine that isn't there, remembering how much has changed in the past year, I cried. I pushed myself against that trophy case, and I pushed hard, thinking that maybe it would fall on me, or maybe pushing would somehow relieve my stress. Maybe it would solve my problems. Quickly, I realized it was for no reason, this pushing. The trophy case wouldn't fall on me.   <br /><br />And it's sick. I'm sick. Because, what am I doing? Am I <i>waiting</i> for someone else to come up and feel sorry for me? Am I <i>waiting</i> for everything to go away? <b>Nothing</b> is going to go away, and I <b>never</b> feel better when people feel sorry for me. But, why am I doing it? Why can't I just hold it in like <i>everyone else</i>, why do <b>I</b> have to be some <i>weak <b>prick</b> that has to <b>arrogantly</b> flout his uncomfortableness to the world</i>? <br /><br />And right before swimming practice started, I moved to the extra room behind the pool that the swimmers store their snacks in. Rachel and I talked. But, I felt so pathetic. The only thing I could do was shove my hat down lower and try to keep my eyes focused on a worthless book in my hand. I had to ignore everything, ignore her, ignore the moon pies in the cardboard box next to me, ignore all the happy, friendly, efficient, proper, well-to-do, exciting people outside of the door waiting to valiantly sacrifice their physical comfort, I had to at least try to ignore these things. If only to keep from dwelling on my thoughts. I cracked a little, and Rachel left the room. I didn't feel any better after the interview. I didn't feel any better after going home and eating. I didn't feel better.<br /><br />I would like to tie it down to one thing. Like Robotics. Like Newspaper. Like School. Like Myself. That would just be blaming something. Pointing my insignificant finger at something, anything, to get the attention of people who have no reasonable intention or need to care. There's no problem to solve. There isn't anyone to blame. It is just how it is. I feel how I do. The world was just build like that.<br /><br />And if someone feels sorry for me, I feel worse. And if someone doesn't feel sorry for me, I feel worse. And I just don't know when this cycle ends. On Friday? But, then it starts on Sunday. Can one day really be called the end of a cycle? <br /><br />Like banging on a wall, I am tense and explosive. And my problems are still there. A Thursday deadline. A Tuesday interview. A Precalc, Physics, AP Chemistry test. Paying for a t-shirt for a lego league team whose members I despise. None of these things cuts deep, so why do I feel so bloody mangled?
