Downright nonsensical, that's what the day has been like. <br /><br />I have found my red notebook!<br /><br />At the beginning of the day, I wasn't very stable, emotionally. Maybe it was the knowledge that I did this to myself, and that it was my own fault, and it could have been prevented by being more careful, or maybe it was the feeling of helplessness from a lack of knowledge of where the darned thing was. Whatever the case, my morning could have been better.<br /><br />I walk into the physics class, seventh period, at the end of the school day. By physics, there isn't any of that gripping and tightening around the throat feeling, that uncontrollable, dark, and overwhelming feeling. None of that. By physics, I've started to accept the fact that a quarter of this year's work and notes have vaporized. Finally, while absentmindedly staring at my physics teacher, I came to terms with the loss.<br /><br />I turn around and find the notebook sitting on a chair behind me.<br /><br />The experience was surreal. My long departed friend, resurrected from an untimely death, there it sat. I put the notebook on my desk and let a wave of gratefulness wash over me. How absurd I was to be fretting over a stack of papers that was within my grasp the whole day. I have no sense.
