Living in the city for two years makes the space required for comfort much smaller. Seeing the horizon is replaced by seeing across the street. And walking outside becomes an art in navigating man-made canyons. A shallow inset of a gigantic maze. Chaos overlapped on gridded order. And coming back to the city is always accompanied by a reassuring claustrophobia. I'm finally back in Los Angeles.

Tomorrow is the first day of class.
