Being the token outsider, I remained quiet.<br /><br />Today, I joined a few members of the Robotics Club to venture to the mystical land of Pleasantview Elementary School. Our mission? For many, it was to get out of classes. For others, it was to teach children how robots work. For me, it was to get to know the team members, and to understand each person's personality, working style, and values. I also went to attempt to establish myself as part of the team.<br /><br />The ride on the little white bus wasn't exceptionally terrible. Besides being awkward, me not knowing anyone on the team, it was as peaceful ride. Once we got there, things changed. <br /><br />Pleasantview Elementary School is a small, ten-room school in the country. Some of these kids live in real farms. The kind one sees on the television, with cows, chickens, and mad-cow disease paranoia. The first thirty minutes went smoothly, as I didn't have to interact with the children. We spent the half hour demonstrating the robots, and letting the children drive the robots. I found out today that kindergarteners are surprisingly human.<br /><br />The essence of human seemed to seep out of these little children. You could clearly see the facinating group dynamics, as some kids were leaders and others were followers. Yet others were disturbers of the peace, and others were nearly silent. These dynamics start to disappear as one ages. With age, comes social responsibilty. With little children, there are no rules. One can sit in the corner and cry without being labled as a depressed sociopath. <br /><br />Thirty minutes pass.<br /><br />The kids are starting to get bored. The VEX robots are starting to fall apart. The kids are starting to run around and kick the robots. The VEX robots continue to fall apart. The team scrambles to grab stray nuts and bolts. The kids are starting to become violent.<br /><br />The quintessence of the human. The purveyor of chaos, the animal from which all destruction stems. <br /><br />And, we continue to repair the robots.<br /><br />Finally, someone breaks out "plan B".<br /><br />Time to build "robots" with the kids. These are no ordinary "robots", I must inform you. These are "robots" that are made of wooden dowels and rubber bands. I have no idea how they are supposed to be built, I'm as oblivious as the children. The rest of the team knows how. I feel like an outsider.<br /><br />Team members begin to be paired with the children to ensure successful completion of the aforementioned activity. Slowly, each child is paired with a member of the robotics team. Some of the members get two or three kids. I'm paired at the end. Naturally, I get the firebrand.<br /><br />"Jonathan" is supposedly the class "math whiz". I consider him more of an inquisitive, hyperactive nipper. We begin the build. I pull out the wooden parts from his plastic bag for him. He smiles at me. I freeze up. I don't know what to do. The smile, so foreign, something that could only come from a child. I put on a weak smile and gave him a wooden dowel. <br /><br />He hesitates.<br /><br />I nod.<br /><br />He nods back and takes the dowel.<br /><br />I felt a deep connection with this little child. Such a primal form of communication, yet the transmission of information was so clear. Like some sort of primitive, instinctive form of link, our minds were linked together for that fraction of a second. I've never experienced such a primitive, yet effective form of bonding with someone else, a stranger, like this before. Only a small child is socially daring enough to smile and nod to a complete stranger. If only this kind of human compassion could be retained, but alas. People like me have lost all pathos to humanity. I can hardly smile or look at strangers. People like me? Are there people like me?<br /><br />We build a robot. We engage in primitive small talk. He asks if I'm going to stay for "snack time". <br /><br />I sit there stunned.<br /><br />I'm amazed that someone would actually want me to join them for a snack. I remember when I was a child, no one ever invited me to snack time. I was alone. But now, something inside of me, was given life again. I was no longer alone. My inner child, perhaps? Or is it something more?<br /><br />I say, "Perhaps... What do you have for snack?"<br /><br />The small talk continues until we finish the "robot".<br /><br />He seems a bit disappointed. I can understand why. When I think of "robot", I think of giant mechs with rocket boosters, and I suppose that's what he thought of too. What we ended up with was a pair of wheels mounted onto a simple wood chasis. The only thing keeping this chasis together was friction. I felt like I let him down.<br /><br />But, he wasn't let down. Soon, forgetting about the dinky "robot", he walks over to the supply table. He pulls out a wood cylinder. A small one, small enough to fit in one's pocket. He asks if he can keep it. I tell him that he can keep it forever, for the rest of his life. <br /><br />He says, "It's gonna' be my pet. A guinea pig!"<br /><br />To him, the dowel represents a guinea pig. Nothing wrong with a bit of immagination, right? I tell him to keep good care of it, and soon I'm back on the bus, back to school, back to a building lacking in what these children excel at. <br /><br />Human compassion.
