Gosh darn it.
<br />Ok, I feel really guilty because my blog has deteriorated.
<br />
<br />Anyways, because of final exams, then a trip to orlando, I have been absent from the computer. Thus not allowing me to update. Finally I'm back. Anyways, my new camera is going to come today! I'm tracking it as of now.
<br />
<br />Anyways, Orlando was very tiring. I have a small diary about it on my palm pilot. I hope that I will soon post it up on this blog. Well, summer is here, and that means that I'll be bored. Which means I will have time. Which means... I can update this blog more.
<br />Well, that's all.
