The "Baby Bunny Massacre of 2006" has officially been prevented.<br /><br />This very true story involves a lawn mower and five baby bunnies in a hole.<br /><br />Like most other sundays, I was mowing the lawn. Grass grows, and needs to be cut. I like to type "cut". When suicidal people google "cut", I might show up. Cut, cut, cutting. I'm still cutting. Grass, of course. I finish up my cutting by mowing the edges of the lawn. This means grazing the barbed wire fence at the back of the yard, grazing the walls of the house, and occasionally panic-swerving to avoid water spouts.<br /><br />I approach a clump of grass. Nothing new. I've been rolling over clumps of grass since I was born. But, as I get closer, the clump starts to move. This gets my attention. Then, a  little brown animal jumped out of the clump. That further got my attention. What appeared to be a chipmunk or squirrel quickly tries to hide in a concrete crevice in the wall of the house. Too terrified to care, it runs straight into the concrete wall of the crevice. I pull the lever and stop the lawn mower before running over it and its home.<br /><br />Climbing off of the lawn mower, I see more little brown animals inside of the clump of grass. I stick my head near it, and four more brown things jump out. They're a little bigger than the size of my fist. Further inspection reveals that they are baby rabbits. I turn to see if the impact-prone rabbit is injured. It isn't, but now it's trying to shove its head into a crack above it. Behind me, one of the baby rabbits runs into the woods. I grab the rabbit in the crevice and put it in my hat, its little body trying to squirm away.<br /><br />I go inside with my hat and rabbit to show my parents. My mother is horrified. She had a friend whose finger was bitten off by a squirrel, or so she tells me. Baby rabbit, squirrel, same thing to her. My dad is fascinated, he comes with me to release it back to its nest.<br /><br />I carefully walk to the clump of grass where it jumped out in the first place. I see two other baby rabbits trying to hide in the same crevice that I pulled the hatted rabbit out of. It must be some sort of communal emergency shelter. Not a very smart one, as it's in a concrete cave with no escape. It reminds me of cold war bomb shelters. <br /><br />I open my hat and let the rabbit back in the clump. Hopefully, the mother will return tonight to feed them. I start the engine on the lawn mower and put it in reverse. I'll ignore that patch of grass for awhile.
