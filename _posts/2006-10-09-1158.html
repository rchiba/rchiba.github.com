I got myself a 900L$ <a href="http://www.luskwood.com/" title="Luskwood- avatar store in SL" target="_blank">Luskwood</a> fennec fox avatar. Rawr, I'm sexy.<br /><br /><a href="http://img144.imageshack.us/my.php?image=forcetduporttq9.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://img144.imageshack.us/img144/8470/forcetduporttq9.th.png" border="0" alt="Look at my hot avatar! I'm so mainstream!!!" /></a><br /><br />Considering the thing cost me eighteen weeks to save up for, I'm liking it very much. Customizable facial expressions, tail movements, eye color changer, and automatic "away" expression. I love it lots. Too bad it's much too late for me to stay up any longer to play around with my new fennec-self. The next few days will be spent accessorizing! <br /><br />I'm not gay, I swear.<br /><br />The dinner jacket I'm in cost about 150L$ at some fancy formalware store. Bought the clothes about a half year ago, the glasses I got a year or more ago. I've got matching pistols for the jacket (but I don't carry them around furry-ish places because of the stigma they carry with them. Recent griefing attacks by random spammers/gunmen/hackers have turned the general public wary of avs with weapons)<br /><br />Is it pathetic when you genuinely get excited about being a new kind of fox in a virtual world? Because I am right now.<br /><br />I spent the other half of my day obsessing over nothing at Ryan's house. Fretting and fretting over homework that I imagine up, over tests that won't come for days. Getting angry and isolationist, trying to stay away from social situations because sometimes I think it's just too much. I don't know how people deal with all of the talking and all of the people. I need alone time as well as people time.
