Today I hated again.
<br />In passing period today, I discovered that Alpha Leader#1's words are like paper clips. She bends them, sharpens them, and stabs you in the eye with them. Then she goes out and brags about her escapades killing me. Anyways, that's my description. Today I got a C. Yaay go me. NOT. I AM SO ANGRY AT MYSELF, but ANGER IS JUST A FEELING SO I AM JUST A STUPID IDIOT!!!! Ok, calm down people...
<br />
<br />It all started when Alpha Leader #1 was standing in front of my locker, incompetently chating away and obstructing my locker AT THE SAME TIME, IDIOT!!! Sorry... Then I asked her to move. She wan't listening because she was just wasting her time gossiping. Just then, Kara (Thank god for her) asked Alexi, I mean Alpha Leader #1 to move. Of course, because Kara is in the hierarchy of the populus, she got the attention of Alpha Leader #1. Then Alpha Leader #1 asked why I didn't ask her to move. Before I could respond, guess what she does???  She starts telling one of her Alpha co-horts about how mean I am to her, bending words I have past said, making me look like a stingy fool, and embarassing me in front of my self. I can't believe her aggressiveness toward me. What did I do. If I say a word to her, she will bend it and stab me with it.
<br />
<br />Anyways, that's my story of the day. What's yours?
