I can never sleep, even on the weekends.<br /><br />Right now, I'm on the downstairs machine, practicing my speed modelling. As of now, I can get from start to finish of modelling of my tank in 7 minutes and 43 seconds. I'm aiming for something like 5 minutes, or maybe 4 minutes, if possible. I've got to work on my eye-hand-monitor coordination, as well as my vertice selecting abilities. <br /><br />I have ten minutes from typing this very sentence to finish the post, as tomorrow will begin in that time. Now it's nine minutes. I hate not being able to sleep. It just frustrates me, but I have to trudge on like a good soldier. At school today, I was falling apart. Sometimes, I would stare at the wall and not be able to stop. Other times, I would be on the verge of a mental breakdown, lump in the throat, panic in the mind, water in the eyes, hightened senses, the whole bit. And other times I would want to kill myself. <br /><br />Not being able to go to sleep is like a container of month-old mixed berry yogurt. Mind you, this yogurt has not been kept refrigerated, but instead has been sitting in a warm, humid environment, opened up. I would imagine such a thing would have many unpleasant lumps and colonies of organisms in it. My mind felt like this container of yougurt today. Old, musty, infected, and malignant with tainted thoughts. That's all I can think back to. With this week being like a giant day and all, it's just like all I can think of is myself feeling bad. 100% memory consumption. All of it. Every single recollection of the past five days.<br /><br />I'm sick of it all. I just want everything to stop for just a second. A fleeting moment. <br /><br />But, I can't. I have to keep moving forward. <br /><br />And, I tell myself that progress is a good thing.
