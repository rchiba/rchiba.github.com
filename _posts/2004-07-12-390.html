I dreamt I was flying. It was so exhilarating.
<br />
<br />My dream all started when I appeared in a bus. My friends and other east tipp classmates were all riding it to go to a field trip, except we were all in college. We went to an amusement park and Mr. Pohlenz said that we could each ride 3 rides. We all went on this monorail that was really high in the sky. The monorail went at least 100 mph and we traveled for a few minuites over a senic desert, admiring the view. For some reason, the theme park was cloudy, but the monorail destination was not. Anyways, We all went to this rickety texan looking, rustic, motel in florida. There was this texan cowboy giving us a tour when I realized that I forgot my toothbrush. I asked Shishir if I could borow his, but he forgot his too. We both started panicing. Then we started the tour. After the tour, I went in the pool/hot tub. I was relaxing with some unknown friends (One looked like a fat John Edwards, one looked like Bill Gates, and one looked like Chad Chambers). Then some girls came and I was like, "Do you want to see me fly?". I tried to fly, but the water weighted be down. I dried off a bit and then I raised my arms and said, "Fly". I made it past the roof by kicking, but then I started falling. For some reason I said, "Mach 40" and I started going really fast. This was the flying part. I flew over florida, then the ocean, then I saw some tropical islands like the kind from the movie where Tom Hanks was stuck on an island while working on fedex. Then I traveled over African jungles and the sahara, then asia, then california, then finally back to florida. All of this taking about 2 minuites. I could go up and down and had full control, except I constantly lost speed and had to say, "mach 40" or "mach 20" to keep myself flying. As I approached florida, I saw a apartment/subdivisions with large tall white houses and decided to freak people out so went really close to the ground. There was sudenly a barbed wire strung from tree to tree, right in front of me. I spiraled toward the ground, but I was uninjured. I tried to fly again, but I just couldn't muster the energy. I realized that I was probably really far away from my group so I decided to rest to regain my engergy. I walked over to a swingset, but then from the corner of my eye, I saw a line of army people training for boot camp on the road. I felt as though they might poze a hazard, since I'm just a stranger in someone's neighboorhood, so I just walked cautiously away, trying not to make any sudden movements.Then I saw a road, so I walked on it awhile. There was a large van that passed me that had on it's side, "neighboorhood watch". There was a fat black guy in it, but he seemed really friendly. He asked me what I was doing and I picked up a instruction manual that happened to be laying on the ground. He pulled over in someone's driveway before I could answer, but I went up to him to answer because I didn't want to look suspicious. I conjured up a story about how I was someone's cousin and I had to deliver a garage door manual to a family friend. He then said, "I used to have a garage door manual like that when I was a kid, How about that? Thanks kid...". Then he left in his large white van. I felt good that I was a liar and I beat him, but I knew it was time to get out of the neighboorhood. I raised my hands and said, "fly", then started kicking. With some effort, I got up in the sky, where I said "mach 40". Upon saying mach 40, I realized that I couldn't go as fast, but I had to make it to my friends. I flew for awhile and then I lost my flying powers. Amazingly, I landed in the pool and everyone was waiting for me. They were older and they said that they skipped graduation to wait for me. I felt glad. Then the pool changed to a harbor and there were many large barges near us. The water was stale and black, and we were all freaked out. But we celebrated my return for awhile anyways. Then the nerdy guy said, "I feel some coral underneath my feet and it's freaking me out!". I felt some too, but it seemed to grab my foot and pull me under. All my friends for some reason said, bye in a happy tone, and I felt better as I sank into the harbour. 
<br />
<br />That was one of my best dreams yet. Maybe it has a meaning. Maybe, it doesn't. Who knows?
