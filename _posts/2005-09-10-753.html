Now their ready for viewing on DeviantArt, so check that out if you're bored out of your mind. I mean, that seems to be the only reason anybody every comes here or anywhere affiliated with me. I don't have the pizzaz to attract people, both in real life and on the Internet. Isn't it silly?<br /><br />You know what else is silly? The grass <em>really</em> is always greener on the other side.<br /><br />Fertilizer is so overrated. Why are people so obsessed over the color of their lawn? I don't see how brown is so much worse than green. It's like our neighboors are trying to over-compensate for their gas guzzling by making their lawns greener. Little do they know that fertilizer is made out of oil too.<br /><br />Bah! Green lawns are for people who care about grass. As for me, I don't care what lawns look like.
