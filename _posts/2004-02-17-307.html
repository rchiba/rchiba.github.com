Average Yo reporting...
<br />It seems that some choice people who ride my bus into the rich neighboorhood (NorthRidge popular people) have a cruel soul. This cruel soul also gave me inspiration to write a speech on it for my Communications project. Anyways, it started with me on the bus going home. A certain kid whos name begins with Jus and ends in Tin started the conversation that let to this. He was ABSOLUTELY BRAGGING about how Thomas tripped this one Delta girl. Unfortunately, this bragging kept on going. One of his quotes was, "She has nothing to lose, she has no friends and is totally unpopular! Who cares if we trip her?" Now, maybe it's just me but this kind of behavior seems a bit mean and cruel. The kid whos name begins with Jus decided to go on bragging for maybe about 5 minuites more. With his chums backing him up and going with him. Supporting such untolerable behavior. As I quote tripping a Delta girl "Right in the face" and it being "funny" has serious issues with the morals of true humans. This just shows that the delicate strings of society are "unravelling" so to speak. I mean, this behavior leads to suicide, self-torture, runnaways, and mental problems. These Alphas truly anger me because they have NO RIGHT to stride themselves into such a situation like this, exececute such a hanious and evil act UPON a delta, and have the stupidity/demoralized state of mind to LAUGH AND JOKE ABOUT SUCH A THING. This is just consuming me, the fact that these people have the state of mind like this, and them BEING RICH, BEING ALPHAS, BEING PURSUASIVE? What a joke. Give me a break... 
<br />
<br />And to say something more, these Alphas went on to talking about their dog who died just a few days ago. They all conforted the SAME kid who executed and supported such acts and cared about the dog and him. The impression that this ingrains in my brain is that these people (BELIEVE IT OR NOT) care about their parasitic pet animals MORE than HUMANS. This is outrageous, unheard of! I need more adjectives, because my world is collapsing on me here. Anyways, this led to my inspiration for my speech. I am going to ask the teacher if I can do it on treating deltas with more respect. I've got lots of support from statistics on teen depression and suicide numbers, in Japan AND America. This is going to be a good speech if the teacher approves it. Then again, the teacher might reject it and all of this discussion go to waste. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, people are calling me weird and psycho and other demoralizing names in Comunicatinos. I really shouldn't pay heed to such accusations, but it's really coming to me. I think that I might have a breakdown again if people just keep calling me names. It's humiliating and hurts my feelings. It doesn't hurt, its more like, "torture", or "contort", or "purturb" my feelings. It's really getting to me. Day after day, same accusations and names. Day after day, I have to endure the searing pain that really seeps into you from the outside world. I am going on a field trip tomorow, but I don't feel like going. I want to go, but I kind of don't want to. Anyways, people aren't going to read this, so this is probably just for my reccord. Anyways, today was a great day. I had an inspiration (Sheesh, those don't come around so often these days) and I resisted a mental breakdown. Yay. No one reads these things anymore because they say they are  "too long". I would like to say that if this 3 paragraphs of my life is "too long" you should go to kindergarten and read picture books.
