My legs are sore, I'm surrounded by papers, the clock reads a little after two in the morning, and I'm 16 years old now.<br /><br />Today is supposed to be some sort of a milestone, but getting both of my English papers done seems to be more of an accomplishment to me at the moment. <br /><br />Tiring. Lots of things going on today. QuizBowl state championships was quite a bit of work. Moving furniture around, untangling cords, allocating food, managing resources. There was also quite a bit of play. Running like a madman in the hallways playing tag, frenzied screaming while going for a headshot in a video game, and a little physical violence, as a few of us bickered about taste in music. Actually, that game of tag was the best fun I've had in months. I'm not sure if "normal" people experience more enjoyable activities on a more frequent basis than me. <br /><br />I was lucky enough to have one of my peers show me into the lighting corridor that is on the roof the auditorium. From there, one can look down upon the people on the stage. The view is so outstanding that I watched the whole final match from there. One does have to climb three ladders to get there though, which is a hassle. But, I figure that if janitors aren't around, I might be able to sneak in there during lunch period. That'll be my next challenge.<br /><br />After all of the nonsense at school, I went to see a band concert with someone. Great show, but better talk. And the someone happened to be female, which was a first. Does this strike anyone as odd?<br /><br />We wrote silly notes to each other, which disillusioned me with the idea that I'm socially competent. <br /><br />I'm so fritzed. I think I'll go to sleep.
