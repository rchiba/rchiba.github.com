HELLO, this is me on FRIDAY BAYBE!
<br />Ok, because I was bored I started a lab report on "Specimen #1" I'm just going to type it up for fun, for all to see.
<br />Ok here it goes:
<br />Specimen:Alexia
<br />Hypothesis: Inclusion in Alpha(popular) community can cause mental and judgement skill impairment.
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />Survaillance Details
<br />1. Specimen is over emphasizing my refusal to listan to her music. NO doubt a result of inclusion in "alpha" community.
<br />
<br />2.Brags about detention, very odd behavior
<br />
<br />3. Excessive loud squealing in back of bus :unexplained behavior...
<br />
<br />4. Sirring up ruckus and rumors at back of bus. "Rebel" outlook prominent in "alpha" community.
<br />Tests conclusive, but more testing needed to support hypothesis of specimen#1
<br />-Yo
<br />
<br />Ok, that was my lab report of the day. Anyways, I hope I can study #1 more thoroughly on monday.
<br />Well, thats all ;)
