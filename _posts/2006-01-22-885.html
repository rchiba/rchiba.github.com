I was able to cross out three out of the seven goals for today on my postie that I have stuck to my desk. It's crucial for me to complete the other four tasks in the next thirty minutes or so.<br /><br />Right now, I'm trying to solve the delima of somehow being able to take my very small flash drive to school without losing it. The flash drive itself is the size of half of my thumb, and my thumb is statistically smaller than average. I figure that the only solution to this problem is either duct taping the darned thing to my arm, or putting a string through the little hole on the top of it and wearing it around my neck. Luckily for my arm, I've chose the later option.<br /><br />Usually, I turn my stereo on and that's how I listen to music when I'm in my room. This is because the stereo has three large speakers that surround my room, compared to two built-in speakers for my laptop, and two weak speakers for my alarm-clock radio. Today, I decided to change it up a bit by playing my music through the speakers on my laptop. Through this change, I have discovered something very facinating. The speakers for my laptop are located beneath the plastic that I rest my wrists on while I type. The neat thing about this is that the music vibrates through the plastic so I can "feel" the music. Although the bass is weak, its a brand new experience. Something new, I guess. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning, but who cares?<br /><br />I have overcome a major hurdle for my rendering endeavors. I can now get a model in Blender to import as a model in 3ds Max. Although, I still despise 3ds for some reason. I'm trying to keep an open mind, but it's hard. I find myself squinting to make out the poorly laid out, wigety user interface. I guess a 3ds Max user could say the same thing about Blender, so I suppose beauty (or in this case, UI perfection) is in the eye of the beholder.<br /><br />I just realize that I don't dream anymore.<br /><br />Am I supposed to be scared?
