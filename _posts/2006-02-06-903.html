There was a scheduled outage for Blogger servers at 10PM tonight, lasting an hour. Because of this, I am now tired and up too late to write a long article about how my life is horrible, etc.<br /><br />The animation must be re-rendered, and because of this I am slightly frustrated. I'm sure that in the future, hardware will not be the issue. When hardware becomes so fast that it poses no restriction on human productivity, the next issue will be software. Then, the only thing that would restict work would be the human mind itself. How would one conquer such a restriction. With computers clocking in at thousands of terrahertz, and software designed by millions of open-source programmers, the world would be quite a place, wouldn't it? <br /><br />Once one is their only restriction, life suddenly becomes a big puzzle to figure out one's self. Without knowing yourself, how are you going to beat yourself at something?<br /><br />I'm tired. Pay no heed to my incoherent thoughts.
