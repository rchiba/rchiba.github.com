The QuizBowl team suffered a crushing defeat today, and it was all too sad.<br /><br />It wasn't a failure of the team structure itself, but a failure of a few key individual members, me being the prime example. I blatantly failed. I don't see why Andrew didn't take me out of the game and replace me, but it happened like it happened. It's just that, I'm an idiot, but for some crazy reason, people like to keep me in because they think that I know everything, and I don't. <br /><br />And so, we were defeated from the nerds from far away because I failed, and it's really my fault, particularly because I voiced support of a category that killed us. <br /><br />Enough about QuizBowl, because talking about it always makes me feel bad, just like talking about my future, or talking about English and/or French class makes me feel bad. <br /><br />Bad is such a general word, but right now, I'm using "bad" to describe the dark, unpleasant feeling that one experiences after a failure.<br /><br />I suppose the "bad" feelings were compensated when I came home and discovered a letter on the counter that was from the FCC. <br /><br />I finally got my paper license, and that was the bright point of my day. I'm planning to go laminate it at Kinko's or somewhere else this weekend. Too bad Christmas is so far away. I'll just have to satisfy myself by reading reviews of 2-meter handheld radios until the holiday arrives.<br /><br />Yes, that will be the day.<br /><br />Until then, I'll be radioless.
