I'm so frustrated and it's making me angry amd sadistic.
<br />
<br />It was a complete misunderstanding when my dad said that he needed a new computer and he wanted me to build it. My hopes and dreams are shattered. All of my weekend research has gone to waste. I am a failure. I can't do anything right now, and I don't even want to think about going to diving practice. I'm so emotional right now. I can't get anything done, like my French homework.
<br />
<br />My French homework is to do something happy that brings "joy" to us and others. Our teacher made a point on how we should be happy and help others and charity, and all that other good stuff, but I really don't have time to be "joyful" or make other people happy. I have research to do. Being happy is a waste of time. Why can't you just be sadistic and sad and be more efficient. I type faster, think faster, and physically perform better when I'm in a state of anger or sadness. I can't do that when I'm all happy doody running around in a meadow of flowers and helping homeless people in my meadow of happy flowers with smiling faces that can sing. Plus, we have to write a paragraph on what we did. How am I going to acomplish this when I am so pressed for time, even on a half day? I can't get anything done, nonetheless make myself and others happy for the sake of humanity! I can't do it, and she's grading it. The fact that this is homework makes it even worse. If this is for a grade I am going to have to do it. The next course of action is to find out what to do.
<br />
<br />I pry into my mind and I can't think of anything worthy of doing that will both make me happy inside and make others happy. I could walk my dog, but I'm not sure my dog would be happy about that, and I sure wouldn't be happy. Plus, the that is the example my teacher explained to us in class, so it would just be a cheap cop-out, and I would look like a poser. Not a good idea. In the end, I am in a lose-lose situation. I can't get myself to be happy, and I can't do anything to anyone else to make them happy. happy, happy, happy, happy. Who has time to be happy? 
<br />
<br />I'm so frustrated. I trouble myself.
