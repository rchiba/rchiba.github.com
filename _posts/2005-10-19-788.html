It was a gut feeling.<br /><br />The kind of feeling that I would immagine a suicidal person would feel. <br /><br />It's something queer, this feeling, overwhelming the mind, body, spirit.<br /><br />It comes from the gut and rises, to the lungs. Choking your air supply. Then, to the throat, where heat, congestion, and pressure is felt. Then to the eyes, which start to water. And finally, the mind. This feeling numbs the mind, yet puts it in the highest sense of alert. Like the pounding of drums, the sensation makes its way into every last neuron, shutting down synapses. Controling me. Overwhelming me. The feeling encompasses all pain, suffering, and fear and puts it all into one universal experience. <br /><br />Breathing becomes sporadic. Motor control declines. Eyes cannot focus, as tears are starting to form. The mind tries to divert attention. Perhaps I should look at the floor. I look toward the floor. This does not help. I look at the wall. This does not help. Someone looks at me in a funny sort of way. Heart rate increases. My hand starts to shake, perspirate. Body temperature increases, but inside, I feel cold, dead. A medley of suicidal thoughts and emotion-control protocols rush through my mind. Chaos continues to rage within my small, idiotic head. The walls seem to expand and contract, my mind, restricting my breathing. I close my eyes.<br /><br />A few seconds pass. But, the feeling does not go away. Terror starts to sweep through my body, pulsating, flowing through me as if it somehow fused with my soul. My mind turns to panic for answers. No answers come. Only inquisitive thoughts on how to end one's life appear where solutions were before.<br /><br />I look down.<br /><br />62%.<br /><br />I turn the paper around.<br /><br />I find that I did not realize there was a back side to the test. I restrain my urge to vomit.<br /><br />And to think, there's two more years of this to come.
