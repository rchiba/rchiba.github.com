I failed my math test. I know I did. Oh goodness, I failed it. I must pace now blog-thing.. Oh goodness. I knew the information, I really did. But I froze. Go on, laugh at me. Ugh, this weeks really bad. I've had it rough. So many projects, so little time. Augh! I can't stand it, if I failed that math test, I'll...I'll... Cry. I know I will. I'll break down like the stupid thing that I am and cry like a simpering dog. 
<br />Ugh, bad thoughts, not so bad day but a bad evening. Ugh, ugh, ugh. Yes, it may sound like I'm complaining, sorry. need to vent. gotta go now. work.. work work.... -_- I'm only 14 and I'm workin...how sad. I'm gonna burn out. Goodbye cruel world...*sigh*
