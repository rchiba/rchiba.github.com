The room is filled with smoke, noise, and Torino. The scent of artificial muck that the workers of the culinary establishment lather on the wings of dead animals intrigues me. The senseless chatter swells and dies away, like forlorn ocean waves crashing into concrete tide blocks. People around me sit at small, informal groups, eating chicken off of flimsy, cardboard containers, talking of a number of topics ranging from mundane daily events to the latest gossip pertaining to topics that I have no intent to divulge. And allthewhile we are surrounded by large television screens, projected video of various sporting events. But, who is "we"?<br /><br />Tonight, I attended an informal meeting between QuizBowl members at a local sports and alcohol establishment. I got there early, being transported by a friend. We get there, like I said, early. And the place isn't as crowded as usual, which is surprising to me. We reserve a table, and then grab some handheld game consoles from the counter. The place lets customers use them to play games on the television. A few hours pass while my friend and I tap away on the consoles, trying to figure out how to get past the infuriatingly complex and unfriendly user interface. Time passes. Fifteen minutes pass.<br /><br />We both finally figure out how to get past the first dialogue box, where one enters a individualized PIN number. The dialogue box discovery fades away into the nothingness of abstract mind space as other fellow quizbowl team members begin to stream into the building. Because of our early arrival, the table is allocated in very little time, 15 minutes. <br /><br />The team sits down at a table and everyone orders. I don't. Food is of no concern to me. All the talk goes through one ear and comes out of the other, and I feel so distant from my peers, the world, the table I sit at, the flimsy cardboard containers, and my own dinky chair. So very distant, like reality is not actually reality, but a dream.<br /><br />And everyone talks, smiles, talks, smiles, cracks a joke, eats, smiles, and talks. <br /><br />I don't.<br /><br />And it feels distant.<br /><br />This goes on for hours until the informal gathering is over and it becomes socially acceptable to leave. So I do, running to the local bookstore with my friends. But, even there, I feel cut off, connections not attached, communication difficult, social cues missed. Even the books feel unreadable, my mind detached from the stable ground of the Earth, my body stuck in a depressed stupor.<br /><br />This was the event I was looking forward to all week.<br /><br />The fact that I can no longer enjoy such things bothers me so.
