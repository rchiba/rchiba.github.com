Great, weekends over and an average day with an average yo continues.
<br />On the topic today, I SHOULD HAVE NEVER TOLD ANYONE ABOUT ANYTHING ABOUT MY WEBSITE. THAT RYAN!!! Oh well, he's human like me, like you, isn't he. I guess sometimes we all screw up. Of course, obsolete people should be terminated, in my opinion. Also, I am going to post a new poll today for all of everyones enjoyment. Here are the results of the old one
<br />
<br />What do you think about Popular People?
<br /> 
<br />I hate them SO badly 2 (0%)  
<br />
<br />Like, I'm popular, so shut up 2 (0%)  
<br />
<br />Lets all just hug 2 (0%)  
<br />
<br />They are nice to me 3 (1%)  
<br />
<br />They make me barf chunks 6 (2%)
<br />  
<br />All I want is coexistance... 1 (0%) 
<br /> 
<br />I want to burn an effigee 2 (0%)  
<br />
<br />Who cares about those scumbags 2 (0%)
<br />  
<br />Click here if you are dumb! 216 (91%) 
<br />
<br />The spammer who clicked dumb was none other than the "Carebare" Matt Lucasac, spammer.
<br />Anyways, vote for your country in the next poll!!!!
<br />Ok, anyways, today we played with hydrochloric acid in science class. It was very short of exciting. (Sarcasm)Wow, it sizzles(Sarcasm) was my reaction (pun not intended) to the acid. Everyone , for some STUPID REASON, was talking about how they got burned with the acid. They were bragging like idiotic 4th graders. I hate it when people do that, don't you? I really hate it. I can't wait untill I get out of this school of baboons on wednesday. Finally, just me and my mind. I'll have plenty of time to think on the car. I'll maybe just write all the thoughts down so I can type them here when I come back. I should do that. I should do that....
