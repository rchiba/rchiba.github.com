I filled my blue cup with ice. Walked over to the faucet and pulled the lever up. Down comes the water. The sloshing continues until the glass is full. Ice water is so important in my hot room. But, by the time I trudge up the stairs and glance down at my wet cup, the ice is all gone. All that is left is slightly cool water. Accepting defeat, I take a swig of that good stuff and enter my room. Hot, humid, bordering on steamy.<br /><br />Almost as hot as work today. A severe heat advisory for the local area was being broadcasted on the radio just before I went to the pool to work for seven hours. Heat is unpleasant when not felt in moderation.<br /><br />Tonight is the night I study for my US History II class final exam. I know very little at the moment. I'm so late in studying because I had to work an hour of overtime, making my work last until nine. Now I'm in my room, trying to convince myself to study, trying to convince myself that I'm not tired, hot, or sleepy. Funny thing that the only thing on our exam will be three essays. One on Watergate, one on the Iran hostage crisis, and the last one on the Persian Gulf War. <br /><br />So, I'll stop typing and get to studying. It's the best for both of us.
