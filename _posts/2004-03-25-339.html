Average Yo reporting...
<br />It's raining in Indiana, and according to the forecast, it's going to rain some more. I was terribly bored today, because all of my contacts are away for break. The suns gone, the worms are out (which means I can't rollerblade), and I feel fat. Anyways, I've been tinkering with the various video programs out there. I finally found a decent program that can convert .MOV files to .WMA files. The catche? It is that there is a large logo of the company pasted on anything you convert untill you pay up the $25. Of course, I'm not going to pay, and I am going to stick with the big ugly logo in the middle of all of my videos. I also upgraded (for free) my window's movie maker (comes standard on Windows XP). I'm going to make a movie that has some relevence to star wars. It's going to be crappy and it's going to incorperate "Froda" (my sister with a green afro). I think it's going to be fun. Might take a while to make. If it rains tomorow, I'll have enough time, but I don't neccessarily want it to rain tomorow. If it rains tomorow, then I won't be able to rollerblade. I really want to go skate.

<br />Anyways, this is an excruciatingly exceedingly boring weekend, I mean, spring break. I really want to go back to school. Nothing is fun when you sit in front of a computer 7 hours a day. But, that's all that I can do. Besides folding clothes, eating, walking my dog, or wallowing in my self pitty. I've always been partial to wallowing in my self pitty, but I usually go for sitting in front of the computer. You ask, what do you do in front of a computer for 7 hours? Well, I can respond by saying that I sit in front of my computer waiting for a 15 MB file to download on my dial-up internet. If I had T1, it would download in 10 seconds. I use the internet WAY more than ALOT of people with faster connections. I think I deserve it more. See, look at me, I'm wallowing in my self pitty again. Poor me.....
<br />Bye;)
