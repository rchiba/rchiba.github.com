"<i>It's gonna' be one of those days...</i>"<br /><br />And I really didn't want it to be one of <b>those</b> days. We all know the kind. The kind of days where things are abysmal no matter how many fake smiles you pile on. The kind of time where you constantly have to keep yourself from just sitting down and stop breathing by telling yourself lies about the world, and lies about yourself, as well as lies about other people. Starting in French class, getting a bad test. Something like that just ruins my day, but the fact that it does so makes me feel worse than the initial ill will felt. It's a sad thing when a test makes such a big impact on your life. I tell myself that a perfect person would just brush it off, get over it, and focus on improving, not dwadling and complaining about something that has already happened. These feelings of remorse will do nothing to change the red numbers on my test. And, so because of this, I realize that it's not a big deal, I shouldn't feel anything. But, I do. <br /><br />"<i>It's yourself. You're doing this all to yourself, and you deserve it.</i>"<br /><br />In all reality, I did deserve today. Deserved today for the lack of effort I put into things. When I really should be giving more than my best effort, I'm just gliding my way through the bare minimum. There's no motivation. And when things get down, and things keep getting down, and things don't seem to ever get better, it's hard to be excited about things anymore. Things. Things like tests, things like friends, things like sleep. Simple, idiotic, selfish <b>things</b>. <br /><br />"<i>Concerning yourself with yourself is a demonstration of your inability to think in a broader sense.</i>"<br /><br />The truth finally comes out. Why would talk about myself if I wasn't self-centered? The negative attitude, traced to the source, that being myself. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy as well. I might as well make the world hate me even more by writing more words. And as I do so, I become even more of a jerk than I really am. The period that I just typed is not the end of my complaining and whining. I'm just as bad as the people I criticize from time to time. Why even criticize people? The simple fact of the matter is that it is not correct to do so. My life is <b>incorrect.</b> My mind is <b>incorrect.</b> The words I hear are <b>incorrect</b>. Everything I touch becomes <b>incorrect.</b> <br /><br />"<i>Stop now, people might notice.</i>"<br /><br />I try. But, there's nothing I can do about it. Please, why can't I just <b>not think</b> to myself for a few minutes?
