My cable internet was disabled and everything running on electricity was shot down yesterday, so updating was out of question. Darn thunderstorms.<br /><br />My English teacher said that I possessed the amazing power of "wit" in my speech about Mao Tse-Tung. This is highly ironic because any "wit" orchestrated in my speech was overly rehearsed and pre-prepared. My kind of "wit" is against true "wit because "wit" is supposed to be spontaneous, but making sense in an appropriate and humorous manner. <br /><br />I feel like Jell-O (Which is a brand name that I feel like using because I'm a corporate exploit and the government can't even control the brainwashing that is on TV toward young children to get them to buy toxic, sugarized cereals because of the cute little character on the box and the worthless little trinket inside) because I'm so tired from my abysmal pit of nothingness. I looked through an old yearbook. Amanda looked much different, which is a bit funny, but let's not make fun of Amanda since she is like the most skilled person I know for the time being. Am I living in a bubble, or is the bubble living in me?
