The RAM is working, but my onboard graphics processor isn't being so happy.<br /><br />I suspect the cause of my frequent crashing is due to my onboard graphics processor driver. Rolling back to an older driver causes even more crashing. Thus, I will just wait until Intel decides to update their drivers for their graphics processors. Until then, I'll just have to deal with crashing every five hours or so.<br /><br />I took my chemistry test today. When I took my chemistry test, I was stressed. As I took it, I was stressed. And when I finished it, I was, you guessed it, stressed. Considering that I didn't study for extremely long, I think my actual performance on the test was higher than average. But, it was close. Knowing that getting the test done on time was the key issue, I started the test with a bang, rushing through questions at full speed, not wasting a second to stop to think, just killing off the questions I knew in my head, skipping those I had doubts about. After about thirty minutes of this high-intensity answering, my ears were red from the excitement and effort. The muscles in my hand were a bit sore, to tell you the truth. I'm not a weak person (this statement can be debated liberally), but my hands were red with furious writing. <br /><br />So, I sigh a concerned sigh. I take a peek at my watch and realize that I only have ten minutes and a good bit of the test still needing to be answered. I write. Write hard.<br /><br />Ten minutes pass, but the bell rings on the eighth minute. My estimation of time was inaccurate, so I suffered for it. With the last, long question half-way done, I try to paraphrase my answer, and shove it in the stack of tests on the teacher's desk. I rush to the door and take a fateful left. I don't kill anybody, and so I celebrate this luck by rushing, weaving, and pushing my way through the crowd to get to my class.<br /><br />Practice really does make perfect. After so many months of having to find a way through masses of people, I can easily manage to get to classes, even in the densest of human crowds.<br /><br />And so, that's how my testing went. <br /><br />My ears still hurt.
