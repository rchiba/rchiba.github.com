My connection to the Internet is sluggish. It's something worth complaining about, I guess.<br /><br />Recently, I'<span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">ve</span> been listening to harder rock (notice how I use <span style="font-style: italic;">harder</span>) due to certain people. You know it's time to jump a station when you can hum chains of songs on the <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">playlist</span>. New music sounds fresh. Plus, <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Tif</span> told me that I need to "feel the beat".<br /><br />But, the thing is, it's not about feeling the beat. It's about my confidence.<br /><br />In my mind, I'm often faced with the conflict of <span style="font-style: italic;">Arrogance and Confidence</span> vs. <span style="font-style: italic;">Humbleness and Negative Self-worth</span>. I dislike arrogant people, so I try to shy away from that as much as possible. Arrogance is something distasteful, vile, repulsive, yet so plentiful. But, sometimes it feels like you have to be arrogant to feel happy. I look at myself and see nothing of note, and that's good, or at least I used to feel as if it's supposed to be good.<br /><br />It's not. It makes me weak, dark, and boring. Boring, boring, boring. Ordinary. A stupid potato. I sit around, average, ordinary, a simple creature. And the thing is, I can't call it "humble" anymore. It's more like "screwed up". Something is <span style="font-style: italic;">wrong</span>.<br /><br />Arrogant people are vibrant and loud, confident in their stride, simply exciting. They get what they want and they're admired.<br /><br />I look at myself, and I can't help but try to shove the image away. Pathetic.<br /><br />I look at myself, and I can't help feeling afraid. Afraid that I'll lose things. If I keep sitting in my chair feeling sorry for myself, I'll lose everything. <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Tif</span>... friends... schoolwork... my will to exist... If I stop believing in myself, they'll stop believing in me. And then things end.<br /><br />I'll lose them all because of my frail mindset. I feel pointless. And I know I'm making a mistake. Even if it means brainwashing myself into believing in myself, I know I need to change.<br /><br />In the classroom, I watch students walk in and sit themselves down. I hunch over my books and peer from the corner of the classroom. All of them, they talk to each other powerfully, exchanging loud jokes, hand gestures. On their faces are these <span style="font-style: italic;">bold</span> smiles. Smiles that don't die, can't die. They're indescribably content, they're so confident. I struggle to convince myself that I can pick myself up and save the future I don't believe in..
