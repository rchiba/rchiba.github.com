Here are deposited three significant things that happened today:<br /><ul><br /><li>A mosquito bit me under my watch. A very inconvenient location it is. This morning, I washed my face and felt an itch come from my wrist. I figured it was just irritation from my watch, but the feeling got stronger and stronger. After a few minutes of subconsciously itching under my watch, I took it off and saw a small red bump. Put antihistamine cream on it, it never helps stop the itch, but it never makes it worse, so I wear it to put my mind to ease. I hate mosquitos, and am lucky that I haven't been bitten more than I five times this whole year. The mosquitos usually have no mercy on me. But, I'm not through the warm season yet, I shouldn't count my chickens before they hatch.</li><br /><br /><li>I'm officially a permanent resident of the USA. I got home from schmoozing with Ryan at the pool late this afternoon. My mother handed me a card with my face on it. In the back was on a green background, white text that gives me rights that I should have had fifteen years ago when we applied. All of these years. I can work, I can get scholarships, I can travel. I don't have to wait in the giant "visitors" line at the O'Hare Airport the next time I come home from a foreign country, and I don't have to go to Japan every two years to renew my visa, I don't have to be labeled an "illegal" by those certain people at school who think that visa is only a credit card. </li><br /><br /><li>I told my mother about Tiffany. She didn't make a big deal out of it, and the reaction was positive. She's holding off on telling my father though. She says that if he finds out, he'll make fun of me every day for a long time. I'll trust her discretion and hold off on letting my dad know. He was never much of a social person. He wouldn't understand. Then again, I was never much of a social person. Maybe it's hereditary.</li><br /></ul><br />
