I haven't updated in the past two days first because of a football game and then because of a trip to Chicago.<br /><br />At the moment, I feel very stressed out because I've been working on things since 8 in the morning, and I haven't had any time to just sit down and breathe all day. I hate it when things get pushed back to the wall. I could have gotten it all over with on Saturday. I could have done things I wanted to today. Now I feel like the week has started before it had to. I just finished my chemistry homework, which was a pain. I'm angry right now. Want to kick something. Frustrated. I can't even write any stupid idiot things anymore. It all ends up being a mashed-together lump of crap that isn't worth showing to other people. And it's taking up my sleeping time. <br /><br />Now this malfunctioning program won't post, so I have to take five minutes of my life to open up a web browser and post manually. Stupid. My words, they're all stupid and pointless. Stop reading this shit because I can't stop writing it.
