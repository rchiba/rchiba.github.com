Today was frantic and disapointing. 
<br />
<br />I got many Many MANY B+,s right on the edge of being an A-, but didn't make the cut. I had too many. In math everyone was getting 99%,s and 95%'s while I got a measly 89%. The conclusion was that I am a failure. Anyways, I had too much homework today so I didn't really get to do anything except take a shower and eat dinner and do homework and type a 5 minute post on blogger. I really hate days like this because it makes me feel like I'm 500 pounds and sinking into the ground. Well, I have to get rested for ISTEPS which by the way are rediculously easy. I have to sleep now and I feel tired enough to do so.
<br />Au Revoir!
