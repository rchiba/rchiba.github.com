Currently, I am praying to my mystical computer idol.<br /><br />The reason?<br /><br />I really, truely hope that my computer doesn't crash right now. This is due to the fact that I am burning a DVD, uploading a video file, rendering an animation, playing music, refreshing RSS feeds, ripping music from internet radio, and updating my blog on my trusty Dimension 4700 right now. If it crashes, oh, I'll be quite disappointed. <br /><br />So, my accomplishment of the day? That would either have to be surviving Ms. Henderson's English class, or learning how to keyframe, use IPO curves, and animate in Blender. I'm siding more with the later.<br /><br />I have figured out that rendering takes a long time. I've got 520 frames, which translates to roughly 20 seconds, give or take a few seconds, and each frame takes 22 seconds to render. This computes to a little more than 3 hours. I think the render to product ratio is very disproportionate in this situation. 3 hours of hardcore computing to produce 20 seconds of video? I find rendering very time consuming. But, one must remember that I am creating something out of nothing. Well, I'm not. The computer is the one creating something out of nothing. <br /><br />It's an amazing thing, these computers. You put work in, and products come out. <br /><br />In this case, the product will be my 20 second video file that I'll be waiting all night for.
