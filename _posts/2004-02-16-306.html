Today was boring. Actually, I shouldn't say boring because days are never boring. Never as boring as...
<br />
<br />Anyways, Average Yo reporting in. I still have to memorize my speech, which is an impossible feat. Also, I have to finish my biography report which is due tomorow, but it is on the servers at school so I'll have to somehow find some time to finish it. Wait, I found it on my site, that's done. Tomorow I have mathcounts. Nothng much has happened. Once you really think about it, I don't hate that many things. I can make my eyes spasm now. Now it looks like I'm really psychotic. I can freak people out now. With 30 minuites untill my bedtime, I better wrap it up. I wish I had more time.

<br />Bye
