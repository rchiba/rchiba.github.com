Today was a day of great achievement. I completed five drawings on full sized sketch paper. They are inked, colored, and shaded. It's a great feeling when you create a world. It's even better when you get to see it. These five drawings are basically just a character doing action poses and bubble letters. But, the fact that I did it presentably makes me happy. Not to gloat or anything, but I'm pretty proud of what I did today. I put, what, six hours into five pieces of paper. I'm sure you wouldn't be proud, but I sure am.<br /><br />The characters are "Socialist Dog" and "Dusty the Robot", new characters that were created by yours truly. Basically, they are a crime, and capitalist, fighting duo with a color scheme reminiscent of USSR propaganda, travelling the world to industrialize nations and unite workers for a better tomorrow. The duo enjoys science, but fights to destroy religion. SD's weakness is lawyers, and the Robot's weakness is, well robots aren't supposed to be weak, so I guess he doesn't have a weakness. But, characters must always have a weakness. Superman wouldn't be so interesting if he could just do anything, now would he? <br /><br />But, alas, maybe when I can develop these two, they'll be ready for release to the public. Then you can check out "The Commie-Tastic Adventures of Socialist Dog and Dusty the Robot!"<br /><br />I can relate with these two imaginary beings. It figures, a socialist superhero being my make-believe idol.<br /><br />You know, a red colored pencil goes a long way when you are working with a socialist character.
