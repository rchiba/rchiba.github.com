A lot of things in my life mean nothing to me. The reasons behind why colors are how they are, why I prefer red and yellow to purple and orange, and why I have exactly three empty water bottles in my room. Perhaps these random things mean something. But, even if they do, it wouldn't matter because I have no way of determining what they all mean. And so we learn that although there are important events, and important things that make up the very basis of our existence, they are unimportant if we have no means to understand them.<br /><br />My parents don't understand how computers work. But, they'll never understand, so it's unimportant to them. Computers "just work".<br /><br />At school, one meets quite a few people who understand little about what they speak so powerfully about. But, I don't care about these people anymore, because I'll never be able to understand why they are so naive and obnoxious at the same time.<br /><br />The covering for my eraser is covered in navy blue and light green stripes. I wonder how many designers it took to come up with that design. Randomness. It's late and I'm dehydrated. I wish my water bottles were full instead of empty.
