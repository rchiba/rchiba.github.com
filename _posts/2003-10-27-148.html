Halleluya, I'm back from my adventures in Alabama. I can't write much because my typing skills have deteriorated. My fingers are so slow. Tomorow, I have to hit the ground running so I don't trip up at school. I have a science test I am iffy about and I'm not sure if he will let me take it the day after tommorow. Anyways, I can't type much, like I said, so I am going to type on the weekend, if I have time. I have many oppinions that I want to express before this week is over. Ok, thats all. 
<br />Adios compadres!
