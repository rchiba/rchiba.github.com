Branches and boredom.<br /><br />When you get bored of something, you have to move on and learn to do something else. <br /><br />This philosophy cannot be efficiently applied to practicing my 10 minute speech, but today it has. I'm sick of looking at text. Sick of writing, sick of drawing, and sick of moving around. So this afternoon, as I slowly plodded through creating the six notecards that I will use for my speech, I stopped. What I meant to do this afternoon was to rehearse and properly perfect my speech.<br /><br />That didn't happen.<br /><br />And instead, the 3d bug has hit me again. It's been nagging me ever since I returned from my trip, when I found a nice, free (as in freedom), and generic Blender-specific model that looks promising as a tool to help me learn more about character animation. I've revisited new, as well as old, animation resource websites to help me understand the very basics and solid techniques to creating fluid life. I'm eagerly awaiting the new audio clip for this month's 10SecondClub animation contest. Application, my friends. I must learn to apply the things I read, and in theory, with practice comes skill. When time permits, I'll inevitably find myself learning, or working on such things. And as inevitably as I'll find myself learning, I'll also find myself distracted from other important things, like my informative speech which is sitting like a neglected child in the corner of my room. Unfortunately, I have to give it this coming week. I'm not pleased with my knowledge of it, so I hope to try to stave off my addiction to Blender for a few days so I can do what needs to be done. <br /><br />One of the "things that need to get done" is sleeping. That which I will attempt shortly.<br /><br />Preferably now.<br /><br />Good night.
