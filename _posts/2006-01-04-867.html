Hundreds of thousands of millions of years from now, long after humans have died out and the Sun has engulfed the Earth in searing flames, there will be our message in a bottle out there in the universe, floating out in the nothingness that we now know as "space". Voyager I and Voyager II, NASA's distant and old probes (1977), contain a number of things that, if decoded, could reveal much about our civilization. Images, sound data, and text data that could be our only itty bitty spec of evidence that humans really did exist, that there was intelligent life on a planet called "Earth.<br /><br />It makes me feel small. I'm one person, in a big state of people, out of fifty states, out of 192 countries, on a planet, in a system of nine, in a galaxy of millions of systems, in a universe of... who knows. I find it very humbling.<br /><br />A side note to all of the self-discovering nonsense above, you can check out the images stored in the Voyager probes right here: http://re-lab.net/welcome/<br /><br />On the subject of humans and their place in the universe, I resent the fact that Titan A.E. was a flop of an animation. I really liked the concept, however absurd, and the actual movie itself was enjoyable too. But, I watched it when I was around ten years old, so who knows what my crazy mind was thinking then.<br /><br />But, on a more localized note, school is starting tomorrow, so I can't go without mentioning that.<br /><br />I spent the day helping SecondLife newbies at my daily camping spot, the welcome area chess table, and giving out self-made "care packages" with lots of freebies and links to need-to-go areas. <br /><br />Not like you care, since not anyone I know is an active Second Life resident. I just wanted to gloat because gloating is a source of short-term satisfaction, which is what I need before I start believing that school is indeed going to begin tomorrow.<br /><br />Links, links, and more links. I found SSS via digg.org. http://mirror.softwarefor.org/index.html<br /><br />SSS stands for "Software for Starved Students", but you can know it by "Software that you should install because you shouldn't depend on closed-source software for long because standards will change and you will be screwed". I'm thinking of burning a few .iso's onto a bunch of CD's and just handing them out to the computer un-savy and needy. And there's a UI on the CD for technologically illiterate people, so I'll be able to hand it out to stupid people as well. How exciting.<br /><br />Not to mention they bundle Blender on the SSS CD. Isn't the world wonderful?
