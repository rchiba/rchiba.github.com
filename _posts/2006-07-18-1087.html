My Internet connection is not working, and it is bothersome. Or rather, my network adapter is giving me wonky indications that there is some sort of interference between myself and the router. For information to get to me, I must caress my network adapter. Yes, I must physically be in contact with the hardware to get it to receive information. Like when the radio reception gets better when you touch the antenna. Maybe, there is interference in the air, or the router is damaged in some way. Until the madness of the network stops, I'll have to have one hand attached to the panel antenna while the other surfs the web. <br /><br />Today was a completely free day for me, so I took advantage of this and slept for a long time. Hopefully, this deposit of sleep tokens in my resting bank will stave off the fatigue creditors for a few days. I can't expect the weekends to generate any sleep income anymore. I think there's more time during the weekend, but I always end up doing more during those two days than any other weekday.<br /><br />I went out to Wal-Mart and bought a $40 fire chest. It'll supposedly keep the things inside of it intact if a fire happens to ravage my house. I figure that it's a good price to pay for something that is unlikely to fluctuate in price. Years from now, it'll still be functional, its value will be the same. If I were to buy, say, a computer game with those $40, then I would have gotten bored with it in a few months, and it would be worthless after a year. The fireproof, waterproof, sisterproof box is going to retain its distinct boxiness for future boxification of valuables. And in the unlikely event of nuclear war, I can put things in it, bury it, and die with a false hope that future civilizations will somehow discover the $40 thing.<br /><br />There isn't much to think about during these slow, sleepy days, ok?<br /><br />
