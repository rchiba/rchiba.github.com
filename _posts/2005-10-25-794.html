I'm really not used to this "stay up really late and homework binge" thing that I'm doing tonight. <br /><br />After drinking that 2 liter of soda, I felt like I could take on the world, but now I'm thinking of vomiting all over my chemistry, which is still sitting there with one molecular structure empty. I can't really think in this state of mind. It's sort of a dream/trance-like state in which I'm actually half asleep. I think it would be really disorienting if I didn't go to sleep at all tonight. The morning would come along, and it would be time for school again, even though I just got home from a band concert and was working on homework. <br /><br />In other news, I still have to study for various tests. Wish me good luck, and maybe I'll get finished by 2AM.
