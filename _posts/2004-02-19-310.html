Soddin barn. Ha, love that term. Now it's stuck in my head. Soddin barn....
<br />Average Yo reporting, and life goes on. The teacher approved my speech, WooHoo. I still have to help Devin find a good topic. Also, I have to find statistics for my speech. If I find any good ones, I shall put a link to them here. My speech has to be daring, bold, and most pursuasive to get people to understand the situation at hand. It has to be loud and heard by everyone. Even those dreadful alphas in the back. I have to take advantage of the pliableness of childrens minds. Make them understand what is happening. Anyways, it is very late, but tomorow is mid-winter break (pretty stupid excuse to get out of school, huh?) and I can stay up as late as I want, laboring for my speech. I love speeches. Great fun for everyone. Also, I have nothing to do tomorow, so I better work on my optimist club speech and memorizing my primes. Also, I have started to neglect my ACT book. I have to get back on track to reading it. If I don't I won't have bragging rights.

<br />In gym today, Shishir and Ryan said that I was a perfectionist and an overachiever. I really degraded by these comments. I mean, it is a bit rude, and if you think I'm an overachiever, you should realize that anyone can get A+'s at a public school in the middle of a cornfield in rural Indiana. Devin and I really need to get together for the kingdom project. For those not in the loop, the "kingdom project" is a school project in which the advanced english class members (in groups of 3) create their own fantasy/futuristic kingdom. Devin rejects all my ideas, I mean, ALL OF THEM. I guess I have to go with his sub-par ideas. 
<br />
<br />Well, that's it for today. ;)
