During today's routine medical check-up, I was vaccinated. With a needle. A needle is a sharp object. I don't like sharp objects.<br /><br />But, surprisingly, all went well. The needle went through me like it was coated in lard, but it wasn't, you see? The pain was not in vain. I will be invulnerable from tetanus for ten more years. Unfortunately, that isn't the case for the pain incurred from diving. <br /><br />The pain from diving was high. Physical pain, mental pain, imaginary pain, pain in all of the wrong places, and I mean ALL of the WRONG places. But, when you smack the water after attempting that double-flip, you aren't cured from some disease or protected from a virus. The smack results in you, reluctantly, going up to the board to bullshit (for a lack of a better word) your way out of smacking the water. You know what I did when I was stuck on the diving board with a coach breathing down my neck, expecting me to do some insane trick? Well, basically... <br /><br />...It's all in the entrance. You must look like you are actually committed to what you are doing. Focus, and look ahead. Take a practice jump. Then, "loose balance" all of a sudden so you fall in the water. After you resurface, put on a grimace and take a quick glance at the coach to see his/her reaction. If the reaction is tolerable, sulk to the diving board to await your turn. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />Diving isn't a pretty sport. It's only like that on the outside. Finesse and masculine beauty on the outside, pain and suffering on the inside. I suppose diving is a bit like Windows Longhorn. A technological advancement and engineering marvel on the outside, prepackaged, old-news, post-Macintosh features on the inside. And diving is also like war. Idealized and heroic on the outside, but a bloody, pointless hellhole on the inside. Diving can be put in the category of "Activities That Look Cool To Do But Actually Suck When You Get Suckered Into Doing Them." That's why being a diver isn't fun.
