I find it an exciting challenge to get through the day. I'm crossing the finish line right now. In the last twenty minutes of today, I'm typing up this post to quantify today in a string of words. Without this string, there would be no record that today even happened, and if too many days that aren't recorded come to pass, it's like life isn't worth living anymore. Because where is the future if there was no past?<br /><br />And so I return to reality. From the eternal lethargy that cannot escape me. It's a chronic thing now. No use trying to make up for the lost sleep. I'm planning to do that over the summer. That's the only time I'll be able to do it. My workload is too much of a burden to justify sleeping more than five hours each night. I reserve the weekend to practice speeches, study, and finish English projects, as well as some quick personal renders and Robotics. The weekdays are for obsessing over homework, QuizBowl, filling out forms, obsessing over homework, and Robotics. Did you see sleeping in those lists? <br /><br />I glance down at my watch, stained yellow by the dim bulb that lights my room, as well as my life. But, such dim lighting sets a wonderful atmosphere. That and the modern jazz. It makes me feel like I belong somewhere. I suppose that means that I feel that I "belong" in my room.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, I only started to stay in my room for extended periods of time ever since I obtained a successful Internet connection in my room. I suppose that the dim lighting, jazz, various trinkets, bed, and random gadgets have nothing to do with me "belonging" in my room. It's the sheer fact that my room has access to an alternate universe of information and interactivity, sometimes known as the Internet, that propels me to enjoy my room so much. The atmosphere is just icing on the cake, so to speak.<br /><br />I have a thing for dim lightbulbs.<br /><br />I relate to them.
