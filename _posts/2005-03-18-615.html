I went to the park for a bit of a picnic with Ryan and Company today.<br /><br />It wasn't particularly eventful, besides for some middle school kids who shared the park with us. This one kid called "Kane" was a belligerent and vulgar prick. I really wanted him to be pushed down forcefully, but the key in these situations is to keep the enemy from having a reason to hate you. As long as they have no reason to hate you, anything done against you by them is their fault.<br /><br />Well, I need my camera back from Devin, so I'll have to badger himi this weekend. Can't wait...
