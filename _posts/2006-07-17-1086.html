It's really late at night and it's bothering me that I'm having trouble sleeping to more of an extent due to events and/or ideologies which may or may not be mentioned here in the future.<br /><br />There girl at my volunteer work that couldn't understand equations of lines. She kept asking for help, and I just couldn't stand it. It's one thing to not understand something and try to work toward understanding it, but it's another to depend on other people to do your work for you by "explaining" how a certain problem works. She said, <i>"I'm thinking of quitting soon, so does it really matter?"</i> I just wanted to throw her out of the room, because what she was essentially saying to me was, <b><i>"There is no purpose in this program, and it's worthless to me if I learn anything or not, so give me the goddamn answers you mother fucker, the answer book is right next to you."</i><br /></b><br />I just gave up and stopped helping her. Of course, she got up and leeched answers from another assistant, but at least I kept my moral obligation to not help the arrogantly naive.<br /><br />The rest of the day was wonderful though. Took all of the muck from volunteering and threw it all out of the window. I'm grateful that I have nothing going on tomorrow. I'll take it as a day of rest, perhaps.
