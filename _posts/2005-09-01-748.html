My peers must write "pet peeve" speeches for their speech class. I take speech next semester, but like always, I want to rant on about my own "pet peeves."<br /><br />People who don't take the time to understand the things you are saying infuriate me. I suppose you can call that a "pet peeve", right? Well, what I mean by not taking the time, I mean people who say, "English please?" or, "That word is too complicated for me." Alone, these phrases are harmless questions. But, this changes soon after proper context is applied. <br /><br />For example, I could say, "fraudulent" and Joe Schmo would say, "That word is too complicated for me." This just makes me so angry that I want to whip out an aluminum bat and start smashing Joe Schmo's head in until cranial fluid gushes out and the rest of his body is a bloody pulp. A bloody pulp of organs, bodily fluid, and ripped skin. The word is three syllables for <expletive> sake! If you can't learn the vocabulary of your first language, move to Mexico. I mean, how can I, a non-citizen, know more freaking English than Joe Schmo of the USA? It's a real "WTF" moment. At the risk of sounding extremely elitist, I want to say that there are many people who are unworthy of existance in this country. If I can't even be a citizen, why can complete morons continue to breed and pull down society in this way? <br /><br />Not to mention how derrogatory these comments are to me. I mean, it says to me that Joe Schmo thinks that what I'm saying is too unimportant for him to understand. This hightens my sense of anger and visions of future retribution.<br /><br />If another imbicile walks up to me and can't understand my lingo, I'm going to bash his/her head in.<br /><br />*Note: The above threat was not meant to be directed at anyone in particular. All are equally considered as possible candidates for future head bashing ins.
