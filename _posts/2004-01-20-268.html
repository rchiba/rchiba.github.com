This is the Average Yo,
<br />and I made a few critical discoveries over this past, uhhh, past 3 days. 
<br />Ok, I was at the gym. Hot, sweaty, sweltering, it was packed (because of those new years resolution things). I looked around and made a mental guesstamate that 1 in every 3 people had CD players. Now, that is a bit outrageous. I think that too many people are dependant on too many things. If these crucial things become a nothingnesss, I would expect revolts of stupid people to ocurr. Consequently, the global economy would spiral down in a death crunching depression (stupid people are the people who buy things). These crucial things are things like Coca-Cola (tm) and various music industries. Subsequent to the economic downfall, I predict a deadly malace to spread throughout the stupid community. This malace would effect anyone addicted to strong down rythms and caffine. In the end, the world will die and wither into a rock. That's my prediction for the next 20 years, I guess you can say that it can't happen any worse.
<br />
<br />Also, I would like to mention my despair in mathcounts. First of all, I am the most untalented person on the team. I can't decipher any of the math terms and still can't understand many concepts covered on this team. I am extremely desparate to learn, but I'm just not that good at doing math. Even the sixth graders are ahead of me by a leap, but at least I made it on the team. I guess I could be studying stuff from the mathcounts site, but I won't understand it when I read it. I already don't understand alot of things. I am confused most of the time I am at mathcounts. Compared to everyone else on the team, I seem like such an obsolete model of human. 
<br />
<br />Now I feel depressed because I talked about mathcounts. Mathcounts always gets me depressed. Consequently, I forgot all the other topics I was going to talk about. Dang...
