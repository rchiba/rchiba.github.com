Blog-thing, in the dreary and often times blissfully unaware set of mind my friends find themselves in, I can't help but wonder if they are totally ignorant of the fact that they are highschoolers and NOT in kindergarten. Ah, what joy it must be to be like them, so blissfully unaware of how childish they look.
<br />Isn't that a nice introspective into the mind? I tend to be doing that a lot these days, desperately trying not to loose myself again, while further fortifying my social walls. My friends are worried about me. Again. I am so pathetic, aren;t I? I worry even my friends.
<br />But, I wonder, who is more pathetic? Me, or my parents? My parents can't even see my slipping sanity, maybe that is because they too are intoxicated by the realm of stupid and foolish things. How dreary, how blaze, and how utterly fruitless. Are these my final moments of sanity? I do not know, all I can say is that I can feel myself slipping back into the place I had so desperately wanted to erase. That little box that had contained my very soul for most of my life.
<br />I guess I was foolish to think of myself as free from such monotonous tyranny. Foolish for thinking that I didn't have to shrink in the halls, and furthermore, I was stupid enough to think that I would never again flinch if someone so much as brushes my shoulder.
<br />I'm sure I look fine to everyone around me, but I guess I haven't let anyone know me well enough to see past this mask of mine, to peer into my eyes and see my cries for help. It is scaring me, and I am at a loss as to how to fix myself again. It seems my sister shunning me is breaking me, and my own withering body is tearing my apart.
<br />My physical existence and spiritual soul are at sake, and no one can hear me screaming. Is it that my facades are actually working against me now? Foolish even the toughest of my critics even now? How I wish I knew these answers, and how to satisfy my brain's lust for knowledge.
<br />Until I can figure these things out, I will ty to fufill my promise and update.
<br />On a note that makes me even happier, I have lost weight yet again, and I am succeeding in my quest to be physcially fit. Yet I can't help but think about this quest, and how sad it is that everyone, no matter what size, race, shape, or color, can not yet be accepted.
<br />In my sanity's plight, my sane voice cries out to me in an anguished cry; 'Is this world we're living in full of three-year-olds, too proud to admit their own faults and accept others?'
<br />Till next time, bog-thing,
