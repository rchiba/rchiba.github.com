Hello, this is Ryo Chiba. 
<br />It is a very hot and sunny morning with the temperature skyrocketing every second. I just mowed the lawn so I am very hot and tired. I think I got a sunburn. Anyways, I was talking to my friend, Justin, and we looked for cameras. It was a hard search but we eventually found a good one. Well, thats about it right now. Oh yea, im a little sick right now, but hopefully itll get better by fribat. Hopefully...
<br />TATA;)
