I've got less than half an hour before this day, Friday the third of the second month, will end. This means that I have less than half an hour to post, my deadline.<br /><br />Right now, I don't know how I'm awake. In the past few days, I haven't slept. And so my sleep debt grows larger and larger. I really can't figure out how I'm still moving right now. One would figure that something as essential as sleep is... well, essential.<br /><br />Will I challenge a fourth day? A fifth? My lifetime?<br /><br />But, it seems like I have no choice. So the answer would be the last one. I have to say, my purist work ethic will be the end of me.<br /><br />Now, there's a speech to be written, a book to be finished, a worksheet to be written upon, a test to be studied for, and an animation to render.<br /><br />But, am I getting anything done if I can't feel emotions anymore? What is reality but what one feels? My mind is dull with time. My hands shake even more than they usually do. I can't focus my eyes on one spot and do things efficiently anymore. <br /><br />So, my life's a cycle of doom. I have to get things done, so I stay up. Staying up makes me get things done at a slower pace, so I have to stay up even longer. So on and so forth. Blah. Not good.<br /><br />Or is it?<br /><br />I can't even tell anymore
