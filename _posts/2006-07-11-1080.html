I'm wearing a solar watch which won't run if it's left in the dark. It helped me realize that even the most constant source of energy, the sun, can fail. Indoor lights can power the solar cell decently, but the electricity for those lights come from power plants that burn compressed bio-material. The compressed bio-material got its energy from the sun. <br /><br />Sometimes, the greatest things fail. We all look up at the sky and feel the sunshine on our peachy cheeks, form armistace agreements, vow to disarm ourselves, promise to work toward peace and not war. But, in the sky there is no sunshine, and hope is often shot down by the raindrops of conflict. Brutal fighting, random killings. And ordinary people, as well as people somehow "justified" in dying, are targetted for reasons that can't stand up without a crutch and a wooden leg. It's hard not to grow disillusioned, and see that history is a window to the future. <br /><br />I hit myself in the head. It's stupid to just think about one side. There can't be bad without good. And there are plenty of people who go beyond their obligation to help other people. The only self-interest they have are other peoples' interests. The greater good, a movement towards a perfect world without suffering.<br /><br />That can't exist. What am I doing here in my happy little world? I don't deserve this.
