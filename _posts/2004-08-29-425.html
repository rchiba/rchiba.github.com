Mission "Get AOL CDs From Target" was a success. I was able to collect 15 cds in total with my acomplices Ryan, and Lisa. That almost doubles my collection. In addition, I got a new radio alarm clock and it can be run on batteries! W00t. I can listen to the radio while on the computer now. Anyways, it has deachable speakers and looks stylish and it makes me happy. Anyways, I took some good pictures of the AOL cds while at Ryan's house. I'll post them later. Anyways... After the Target escapade, Ryan and I threw the cds at each other and threw them in the air. It was fun, even though it sounds so dorky.

<br />On the octoberish side, I have an idea. I'll dress up as Dorthy from the Wizard of Oz for halloween and go with ryan. Very exciting, don't you think? And do forget my trusty sidekick, "Flashbang". Otherwise known as my Camedia D-380. Able to blind crowds and take a snapshot of them at the same time.

<br />Again, it is the end of another weekend. And the start of another week. I still can't believe this Middle School to High School transition has gone so easily. I know something bad is going to happen sooner or later. Well, I can't really say that, because well, that's not optimistic. And I try to optimistic all the time.
<br />
<br />Oh yea, I'm addicted to pogo.com for some strange reason. I know that there is evil lurking in ANYTHING that is owned and operated by AOL, and that AOL in general is evil, I still can't resist playing those stupid games just to get prize tokens. There is something magical in winning prize tokens that is just mezmorizing. Oh yea, I found an article in WIRED news that talks about this site called freeipods.com. You do some offers, make your friends do some offers, and then you get sent a free ipod of your choice. They say it really works, but it smells so scammish. I just does. Well, I have to go tinker with my new clock so... until next time... BYE
