Is the week finally over? Or, am I hallucinating again?<br /><br />For me, nothing is ever over, because the sequence of events that consumes my life continues without stop, no matter how I feel.<br /><br />The next few weeks will be allocated for rest. Rest so I can tolerate the next week.<br /><br />Rest... What a joke.
