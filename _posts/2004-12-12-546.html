Heaven would be so nice now.
<br />
<br />What's the point of living a life that sucks?
<br />
<br />Why do I... I... exist? Why should I keep going?
<br />
<br />My life is a living hell right now, and I expect it to get progressively worse over the next week. Finals and all. Desparation and depression come hand in hand. I hope I can make it.
<br />
<br />I am such an idiot. Andrew can do all of the biology worksheet in no time. I've spent the past weekend doing it and I'm on question five. It just goes to show you that I am a retard. I can't work, process, think, and move faster than many of my peers. I just am not supposed to exist. I don't.
<br />
<br />Maybe tomorow will treat me better. Probably not.
