It seems that whenever I'm given time, I waste it away, but when I make my own time, I use it like there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />I think this statement can apply to a number of things in life. I can plug in any word for "time", and it'll come out all the same. Money, art, respect, power, etc. I suppose it has to do with our inherent nature to value those things that we have suffered to create. I suppose even in our "sophisticated" reasoning systems, we all have a bit of self-centeredness. The things other people strive to create are thrown away, trashed. <br /><br />We throw away plastics, old electronics, half-empty cans of soda, and a whole number of other things. I think it's maybe because other people have strived to create these items.<br /><br />In third world countries, people keep plastic bottles, eat and drink every last bit of food they can get. Yes, it's mostly for necessity, but they work hard to survive and aquire these items.<br /><br />And sometimes I wonder if we'll ever run out of things to throw away.<br /><br />But, then again, ignoring the situation always makes one feel safer.<br /><br />Is it all about me?
