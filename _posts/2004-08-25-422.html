<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As I walked from beige room to beige room... hauling the books burdened upon me to their predetermined destinations... trying to ignore the monotony of the crowd rushing, talking, pushing. I notice this one adolecent. Listening to heavy metal music, he walks slowly, deliberately... This adolecent is rather large and intimidating. The first impression I get from this person is that he is not a good student. Not a very viable impression of course, because many kids listen to heavy metal music. I wonder what made him so noticeable... His dreary eyes? His deliberate walk? I don't think I'll ever know.
<br />
<br />Anyways, the inevitability of something going terribly wrong while the day is going on was putting pressure on me. That's when I started listening to jazz. It really calms you down. I was doing my homework and I felt like exploding. I listened to the jazz and cooled down. It's probably a stage. Yes... a stage....
<br />
<br />Anyways, at lunch, the people who sit with me (Joe, Eric, and this short kid) always leave me. It's so depressing. I have no where to sit except by myself. Then Brian Durban comes up to me and puts a humerous spin on things. It's not apparent to me wether he is trying to cheer me up, or just insult me in my face. It's pretty hard to tell with Brian. Crazy kid I tell ya...  But there are other things... worse things than sitting alone by yourself, with no one to talk to in a crowded lunch room. Things like... forgetting my homework as such.
<br />
<br />I have so much on my mind. I have so much.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I still live in the same world I did yesterday. Oh yea. I'm glad I finally find a teacher with computer skills! Huzzah! Go Mrs. Schnieder! W00t! Anyways. I'm thinking of making a new banner. What should I base it off of? I'm thinking... My template has to match my banner, so it's going to be pretty hard to decide. I really want to change my template to a bluish greenish, more smooth kind of look. Currently, my template looks like it just came out of the woods like a hobo. Now, is that a good impression of me?
