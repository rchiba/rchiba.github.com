I spent most of the day turning this:<br /><img src="http://img61.imageshack.us/img61/5042/hondacivicblueprint8jp.jpg" title="Blueprint" border="0"><br />Into this:<br /><img src="http://img61.imageshack.us/img61/7132/168zm.png" title="Hot Wheels" width="640" height="480" border="0"><br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a very rough model, done in about 6-7 hours. Also keep in mind that I suck. My attempts at a low-polygon model with better topography have come out so-so. My topography still looks very uneven and jerky. But, the model does render in under 30 seconds using ambient occlusion (my last car took 20 minutes to render under the same settings, and so you realize how horrible I am, or was), so I know I'm making progress. I'll be happy as long as the poly count stays under 3,500. Right now, it's like 8,000, but the rims of the car take up about 5,000 polys. My rims are horribly modelled, slapped on last minute. I plan to, if I have time, optimize the car tomorrow and perhaps put materials on it. Perhaps I'll even finally pressure myself to learn to uv map things, but I doubt it. Texturing scares me.<br /><br />I cut my finger opening a box of bandages when I was working the pool today. When people ask me to do things, I start to panic if I can't do them quickly. Instead of carefully opening the box up, I haphazardly took the box, grabbed two random sides, and ripped it in half. My finger is thus sliced by the cardboard. This is ironic. How wonderful. I know you folks care so much about how I cut my finger on a cardboard box.<br /><br />I'm proud of myself for stopping my 3d endeavors for tonight. So many times I have taken my precious sleep hours, sometimes all of them, and turning them into a modelling bonanza. Nights are so great, yet so horrible for modelling because it is quiet enough to concentrate, but a mind without sleep lacks the ability to model well. These nights are usually followed by depression, and/or hobby change. It's great having a bunch of hobbies, because once you get bored of one, you just move onto the next. I believe this is my fourth or fifth cycle. The cycle is usually: drawing->modelling->rigging->lighting->animating->lurking forums for advice->drawing... This continues on for an infinite amount of time, or until I die.<br /><br />Bah, the night goes on, and I have yet to reply to my important email, as well as write in my paper journal. Farewell, I am off to write.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
