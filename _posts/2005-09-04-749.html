The following is the rough draft for my English paper. I felt that it was non-Englishy enough to post here.<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br />I'm a wreck when it comes to writing papers. A typical pre-assignment week consists of panic, terror, and self-incurred procrastination. Every single detail has to be perfect, but the details never are. So, it's no surprise that the very moment the rubric to another Lord of the Flies paper contacted my hands, I started worrying. Dread is a student's worst enemy, especially when dealing with the heavy symbolism and allegory William Golding put in his timeless novel. What was surprising though, was the convenient location of a topic involving irrational, rampant fear.<br /> Soon, the topic of fear was bushed aside and forgotten. I was busy trying to brainstorm ideas, sort though events in the plot in a logical manner, and set a time frame for myself to accomplish this task. This hasty analysis of the paper was a “back of the mind” type of thought process at first, but soon the attention directed at the movie being played in class receded and my mind was filled with thoughts about this paper. My delicate insecurities about my writing skills and my place in class did not help with this. This quickly lead to rationalization and self-assurance. I eventually combated these thoughts and returned to watching the wonderfully monochrome film. Although I thought these paranoid thoughts seemed to be out of my head, there lurked a hidden fear of the unwritten word. <br /> In time, I got home. The noise pandemic from the chaotic bus ride continued to buzz through my head. Along with the noise, I started to feel dread for the paper that I was planning to type that night. That night, I pushed my books and various writing utensils aside in an unfriendly gesture. The scheduled planning session was canceled. My mind seethed with hostility toward the paper. Although my rebellious attitude kept me from writing my paper, it didn't keep me from thinking of it. While in bed, the dreadful paper seemed to loom above me, as if I was possessed by a wicked spirit that happened to curse paranoid adolescents.<br /> On Saturday, I began to ponder my state of affairs. With Labor Day weekend ahead, my sights were set on the joy of inactivity. Unfortunately, my mind was set on the paper. Three days of mental torture ensued. There were times where I was in my bedroom trying to think of a possible experience of mine to compare events in the Lord of the Flies. My mind would go in circles trying to chase after a non-existent idea. Attempted outlines and supposedly helpful “graphic organizers” ended up as crumpled balls of paper in my wastebasket. Hostility toward the paper grew as I tried to find the perfect topic. My nights were filled with fears of mediocre scores and ultimate academic failure.<br /> Tuesday was another usual day of panic. There were labs, social cues, and worksheets to be accounted for. Regrettably, my day was sprinkled with a bit of extra educational terror. The English paper still brooded in my head. By the end of school, the blaring sirens were going off in my head. So, there I was, sitting in front of a clean sheet of notebook paper. I blankly stared at my wall, as if the answer would be written on it. Like magic, an idea popped into my head. I put two and two together and started writing about my incessant school fears.<br /> Thinking about how all of this happened made me realize that my thought process was strikingly similar to how the boys on the island responded to “the Beast.” In the beginning, the small child with a birthmark mentions a “snake-thing” and fear is instilled in all of the boys. Although Ralph assures the boys of their safety, fear is still embedded within their small, insecure society. Like the boys, fear was infused into my mind once the paper was revealed. No matter how much I rationalized, the overwhelming intimidation of writing a paper remained. In their microcosm, the fear grew. A meeting is held in Chapter 5 to decide on the identity of “the Beast.” A conflict between Jack and Ralph ensues. Later, this conflict results in the death of Simon and Piggy. These are severe consequences for their irrational fear, just as my irrational fear created hours of unnecessary hypertension. The lesson illustrated both in my life, and in the novel is obvious. Fear is a hazard to be avoided. Efficiency cannot be achieved if fear rules life. Just as Ralph failed to maintain unity among the boys, I almost failed to find a topic for this paper. Do not let fear rule life.
