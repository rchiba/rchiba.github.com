Hey blog thing...
<br />Well today in first period Soemthing very bad and unexpected happened. Know what that was? I had a total mental breakdown. And i don't mean one of those moods you get in when you can't do anything, i mean a breakdown in which soemthing trivak triggers and onslaught of emotions and you can't quite crying. It was so embaressing and Crystal was NOT helping matters. I feel so stupid now, even though now I'm happy as a lark...sorta. I mean, everyone saw me crying in Mrs. oakley's office, and then they probably saw her helping me to Mrs. kerr's office. I owe those two teachers so much, i really couldn't handle all that crap. Man, darn the luck it had to be me. But I guess i am thankful that it was me; for if it wasn;t, it would have to have been soemone else. And i do not wish that embaresment on anyone else. I hope people don't give me 'the look' tommorow. Its really unnerving.
<br />Anyways, the rest of the schoolday was Ok, but all day I have felt as though I'm going to burst into a sobing fit any minute. There's this pressure in my chest. Mom also thinks I'm depressed. Great. All i need is she and Kurt fussing over me. *sigh* i got through so much each day...
<br />Anyways, at lunch i got a pleasnt surprise. Mrs. Thomas presented me with the finished product of an art project I've been working on for like, a year. It made me really, really, happy! Of cours,e then i also felt embaressed. But i owe her a lot, she was so nice! She paid for the framing by promising the framing lady's daughter's free private beading lessons! And Mr. Polenz helped her cement it! I made sure to thank them both. Even though a big crowd of Alpha's nearly ruined my chances of thanking Mr. Polenz, throghly ticking me off i might add! 
<br />Anyways, i had a great weekend, i went to Kelly's party. I never dreamed I'd have so much fun, and my friends and I are closer becuase of that! It was soooo much fun ^_^
<br />Too bad my head is begining to hurt. If it wasn't I'd type more. But as it is, i must go. So talk to you later blog-thing!
