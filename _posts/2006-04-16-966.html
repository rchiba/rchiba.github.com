It's raining outside.<br /><br />But, talking about the weather is absurd. The world has experienced what we call "weather" since it has had an atmosphere. It has rained billions of times, there have been billions of lightning strikes, and just as many sunny days as well. Flooding, tornados, hurricanes, ice storms, all run-of-the-mill events that, in the whole scheme of things, are so incredibly insignificant. But, in many ways, we are like the weather. People, they change, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Through the mistakes and folies come character and strength, and sometimes a bad thing can actually do some good. Thunder hits the ground, which starts a fire, which burns down a forest, which smolders to ash. In many ways, this is both a good and bad event. Bad in the fact that trees were killed, but good in the fact that now the soil is fertile due to the ashes, and new life can grow to be taller and better. <br /><br />Most people are like that forest. They get hit by unfortunate events, fall down, and through much effort get back up stronger than before. Occasionally, there'll be a Chernobyl, where an unfortunate event doesn't result in good. But, now that I think about it, even Chernobyl came with good. The awareness of the dangers of nuclear power couldn't have come at a better time. Now we all know that such programs require substantial funding and maintenance.<br /><br />The sound of thunder is comforting. Like the organic thud that comes about from falling into bed after an exhausting day. Like the deep rhythms that bellow out of a passing car at a red light. Like so many little things that make life more than a twisted dopesheet.<br /><br />Sometimes I have dreams of being hit by lightning.
