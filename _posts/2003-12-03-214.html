Whee...
<br />I am going to take a notebook again today so I won't forget all the things that happen. I am sick of that primitive minded 7th grader cutting me in line. I shall stand up for my rights. I will describe him, he is 4 8" and has blonde short hair. He has a medium build and has freckles. Thomas Taylor has contacts with him. I think I will post his phone number and address when I find those out. Then everyone who reads this can prank call him. Muhahahhahha. Now that would be funny.
<br />
<br />Ok, first of all, I have to find a notebook. I think I left it somewhere, but I forget where.
<br />
<br />I have concluded that Devin has a bit of a mental disorder. I questioned him and he is a very bright child. I cannot recruit him though, because he is in his "teenager" stage. He doesn't want to write like Amanda, Justin, and I. He says that he has a "life". I cannot decipher what those are.
<br />
<br />I the bus is coming for me so I gotta go so bye.
