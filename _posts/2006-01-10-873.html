It seems the days are getting longer, most likely because they are.<br /><br />This also has to do with the fact that there are so many things to do that life seems to drag on. Lots of things to do mean lots of things to dredge through, such as multitudes of tedious vocabulary questions and chemistry worksheets. That combined with the Robotics build-season, it's a big lump that lengthens my day considerably. For me, this is good.<br /><br />I value my time. After all, we're all given a certain amount of it when we come into existance. Each second that passes as you read this sentence, this amount of time gets smaller and smaller. <br /><br />The window is shrinking, very slowly.<br /><br />But, if it's shrinking, why not pretend to lengthen it? I can delve into my own little world of slowed down time and pretend, as I flip through the pages of my recently-assigned, rather lengthy Charles Dickens novel, that time is passing at a slower rate than it actually is. After all, reading Charles Dickens often makes one feel dreary and lethargic. <br /><br />I want to vomit on my book. <br /><br />Books, books, books. What is it with all of this literature nonsense? What is there to bilk from these unbearably wordy texts? If there's one statement I can make without any sense of remorse or guilt, it is this:<br /><br />I hate literature.
