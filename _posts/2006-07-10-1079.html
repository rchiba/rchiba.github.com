My 20 hours of "service learning" ended last week. Today, the hours at the volunteer place passed by excruciatingly slowly. Every glance at the various chronographs stationed in the room was painful. I really shouldn't express this pain, as these words I'm typing are mere complaints, after all, <i>this is a <u>volunteer</u> gig</i>. My complaining is pointless and will most likely eliminate the little goodwill I have with you. That's very unfortunate. Because I figured out goodwill is a very powerful thing.<br /><br />I biked around my neighborhood to get to my pool job a few days ago. I have to bike a very limited distance, but I do encounter at least three people every time I make this trip. Before my discovery, I would never wave or greet another person. <br /><br />"Don't talk to strangers", everyone told me.<br /><br />I would just bike, ignoring them, pretending they didn't exist. And usually, they would see me and do the same. No eye contact. We're both blurs to each other, and there was never any human connection. Two seperate entities, and not a trace of friendlyness or common humanity.<br /><br />But, on the bike trip a few days ago, I decided to perform a few hand waves, maybe a smile or two directed toward these random people. And, surprisingly, people did the same. It sure did make me feel better, and I hope I did the same to them. I don't know what it was about it. Hand motions and smiling seem simple enough. But, the meaning behind the motions were what carried the most importance. For once, I was acknowledging these other people's existences. I was admitting them into my circle of very, very faint aquaintances. They weren't blurs of color anymore. At that moment, I realized how <i>"Don't talk to strangers"</i> is a relic of the dangerous past. I'm not an easily manipulated kid anymore. I'm allowed to be happy in public now.<br /><br />I was stupid to think for so long that an unhappy sentiment would repel danger. If anything, it perpetuates it. New orders: Smile, smile, smile. Yet again, false positivity and optimism solves all.
