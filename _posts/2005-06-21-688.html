Today I spent the better part of the day shooting zombies with firearms on a television screen. It's amazing how therapeutic mutilating and burning zombies can be! There should be a whole meditation routine, similar to tai-chi, that involves zombies, a multi-national pharmacutical corporation, and the president's daughter trapped in a crazed foriegn village. It makes so much sense, don't you think?<br /><br />Well, I figured out that Amanda doesn't live that far from me, which is pretty amazing. Maybe, sometime I'll bike there or something. 4.3 miles? It's possible, maybe if I take steroids for the next few years. Oh yes, the second birthday of my blog is coming up, and it's amazing. Like I always say (I really never do say this), how can I stand writing nonsense? Well, blogging has turned from a "chore" in the beginning to a hobby to a habit. Yes, someday I'll die and I suppose if Google survives long enough, there'll be a bit of me somewhere inside of a disk in a remote server. I would rather be imprinted onto a disk of a server than blasted into space. Those "space funerals" aren't really space funerals anyways since your ashes burn up in the atmosphere and return to Earth anyways. What's the point in that? It's like trying to go around the world on a race track.<br /><br />Perhaps I will study more driving nonsense now. Good night.
