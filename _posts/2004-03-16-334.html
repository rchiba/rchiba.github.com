Snow came, and went.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />Today was career day. It was very boring, but I got to get a coffee mug from this military guy. We went to normal classes in the morning and after lunch, we got to go to 3 seminars for different careers. The first seminar I went to was supposed to be Air Flight Instructor, but unfortunately all they could find was this Air Force guy. He did pretty well though, and he had some cool freebies like mousepads and (only 4) coffee mugs. I was one of the lucky guys who got a coffee mug. Anyways, I cannot join any armed forces because I am not a US citizen. Oh well... Anyways there were a bunch of army and armed forces kids who always wear camoflauge pants to school in this seminar. I felt a bit segregated. I mean, I was the lone guy with sweatpants and a nice sweater while everyone else looked like they were already enlisted in the Army. Pretty intimidating, eh? 
<br />
<br />Well, the next seminar I went to was for a lawyer/judge. It was pretty packed because lawyers are known to make a lot of money. That's all kids care about these days. They don't even care if they like the job or not. It's a stupid and redundant run for the cash. Well, I can't blame them. Kids grow up in this money and cash oriented world where you have to have cash to have an acceptable life. Well, the lawyer/judge dude did pretty well. He didn't give out freebies except some candy. I hate candy so I gave all of mine to some people in the hallway.
<br />
<br />Then I headed over to room 9. I originally signed up for neurologist, but the closest occupation they could find was cardiac sonographer. This was boring, but I can't blame them, because if I had to do this in front of kids, I would have probably done worse. We got to measure blood pressure and stuff, it was fun. 
<br />
<br />At the end of the day, I was glad to get it over with. Career day is always long and tedious. Anyways, I got my in-line skates. Now I just have to wait a month to wear them. Grrrr... That is going to be hard to not think of them. Oh well...
<br />
<br />The day is coming to a close and I better say goodbye. This day has been a good one. Now to memorize my 12 scales for band....Grrr....
<br />
<br />Bye;)
