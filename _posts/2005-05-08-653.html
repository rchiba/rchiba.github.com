My stereo is making plinking noises. It sounds like there is marble knome who lives in the stereo that randomly spits out marbles. I bet there is a marble knome who lives in my room. Plus, I've got marbles on the desk near the stereo. There is probably a whole commune of socialistic marble knomes who have been guided in the wrong direction by a dictator who claims he is the spawn of god. The dictator rules over the marble knomes by sending out marble knome propaganda, so all of the marble knomes think life is better now. More marbles, more sand for marble making, more knome food (Similar to fish food, except crunchier,) and more cool music that I play. This knome dictator will eventually have a personality cult and have pictures of himself all over the innards of my stereo. By the time you know it, my sony LBT-G1000 will be a heavily industrialized, but highly uncomfortable marble knome breeding ground.<br /><br />Those darned marble knomes.
