I couldn't update on Thursday because I was rushed on homework. I studied Mucho Hardo and did all my homework, wrote all my essays, prepared all my speeches, etc. etc... Anyways, the bottom line is that I was totally confined to my homework. You can... you can say that the homework enslaved me and I was held captive by it. Anyways, I have all these things to talk about and I don't remember most of them....
<br />
<br />What do I do to get a scholarship? I really need one. If I don't get one, that would be bad considering that the college rates are SKYHIGH right now and they are rising. I can't believe that the Saudis are getting free college educations. I guess they have to spend all their money somewhere. I guess Saudi Arabia spend it on better things than most people ***looks around the White House***. 
<br />
<br />What do I do when I need a job. I need to pick a career. I need a stable job, I need to do some networking, I need to get some books and read about buissiness and finance. I really need to do some studying. I am not so proficient in understanding things, but I'm willing to learn. I am willing to learn just like a ton of other poor immigrants. I need a plan.

<br />Anyways, I should change the site color, it needs sprucing. Something sherbet... Something white... Maybe a bit of creativity... I have no clue... Today at school, I went to band and all the other classes and I feel like such an outsider. In homeroom today we got this little white slip of paper. It was a ballot for who we chose people out of the 8th grade who would be "class clowns" or "most fun on a desert island". It conjured up a memory that was hard to swallow down. When I was a little kid and I got a yearbook, I turned it to the very back. In the back had all these tall, big adult like teenagers who were labled "class clowns" and similar other names. I wondered when I would ever become like those people. When I got the paper, I secretly said in my head, "Wow, I'm Old". Then I started feeling really scared at what I will have to face in the future. I am nervous. Anyways, I casted various votes, and when I was done the teacher said, "Telling your friends what your votes were skrewed us up last year, Don't tell your friends your votes this year!" I understood and vowed not to tell. In the hall most of the popular monkeys splurged their votes to all the popular people in the vicinity. Of course, popular people are going to vote for certain popular people, and my conclusion is that all the people who are picked by those things are going to be stinking popular. My conclusion could be wrong, I have to wait untill it is spring to find out.

<br />Anyways, I have to get to studying this book, <em>The Light in The Forest</em> and taking notes on it. This weekend, I also have many other things to do. My favorite thing I can look forward to this weekend is changing the colors on this website. I feel like a nerd/failure now. Someone help me....
