Ok, YO here. There is much to write about.
<br />
<br />Of course, today was "Mix-it-Up Day". A pointless day that is full of wasted energy and posters. All that wasted paper, and for what? Sitting with people who want to burn you? I think that all that wasted energy should be used in some other form. Most of the school is on my bias on this one.
<br />
<br />Anyways, with the "Mix-it-Up Day" thing going on, there was much chaos, crime, and breaking of rights ensuing. Those idiotic cutters who cut the line are the people who I despise. Yes, burn in the fires of death you scumbags. Cutters: Ben Taylor, Thomas Taylor, Zach Schmit, Various popular people, and of course, THOSE IDIOTIC MORONS FROM 7th and 6th GRADE. In my mind I want to torture their souls! I don't know about you, but I feel like taking an offensive on this issue. 
<br />
<br />Them cutting means that I have to wait more in line. I don't know about you, but those minuites ADD UP! The fact thatI have wasted my life because of those demoralized JERKS is intolerable! I am willing to take an offensive. I don't know how to though. I hope these people grow up to be better, so they don't demoralize America! You know, I could... post their very personal information on here, but I am not because I am better than them. I take pride in myself. Those scumbags are too low to have pride. I bet those bottom-feeders party all night and play video games. Only to die an unsuccesful life. A wasteful life. Pointless? Tell me about it! 
<br />
<br />Anyways, besides that, Amanda complemented me. I feel so happy. I must really be a mean, idiot to be excited to have 1 complement. I should just die, but... so should those line cutters. Actually, they shouldn't die. They should be tortured to the fullest extent, and then let go into the wild as brain-damaged humans, only to be slaughtered my flesh-eating maggots. Now, that's something Shishir would say!
<br />
<br />Well, I am very angry, and no-one cares, so that's why I'm the Average Yo, I guess...
