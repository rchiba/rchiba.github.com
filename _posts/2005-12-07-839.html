While looking through my various furry forums, I happened to catch a glimpse of a name I remembered from a month or so ago. <br /><br />Paul Escobar.<br /><br />My heart beats a bit faster, and I get excited. The post states that the link is to Paul's newly minted site, featuring his art. I really hope the link isn't broken or the post is just some spam.<br /><br />But, the link is indeed genuine. Upon clicking the link, I am redirected to Paul Escobar's site, and I sit in my chair, trying to cling to the tiny morsel of satisfaction that I feel from discovering such a wonderful place. <br /><br />I read around, and find out it was created yesterday. And my meager satisfaction grows to pride. I look at his art and it makes me happy.<br /><br />Then, being the bold person I am, I decide to email him and tell him what I think.<br />-------------------------<br />Subject: Mr. Escobar, you are my hero.From: Ryo Chiba <ryochiba@gmail.com>  Tue, Dec 6, 2005 at 6:08 PM  <br />To: artdevnull@gmail.com  <br /><br />Ever since one day... ever so long ago.<br /><br />Perhaps it was about a year ago. I'm not quite sure.<br /><br />I've been facinated by your art, and your name I have remembered.<br /><br />Thus, when I stumbled upon your humble site (obsessively searching<br />forum posts does much to one's mind), I was delighted to find art by<br />you.<br /><br />Well, I suppose you'll read this, roll your eyes, and delete it,<br />thinking "What another crazy fanboy"...<br /><br />So I guess I won't waste any more of your precious time. After all, to<br />me, bothering you is like bothering some otherworldly god.<br /><br />Just know that you've got fans, and one of 'ems me.<br />--------------------<br /><br />And I wait for a day, and it just so happens Paul is the kind of person that is famous enough to be known on all the furry forums, but not famous enough to ignore fanmail. Opening Paul's email was like opening a big, sparkly present. Joy, joy, joy! And here it is:<br /><br />----------------<br />From: Paul Escobar <artdevnull@gmail.com>  Wed, Dec 7, 2005 at 9:06 AM  <br />To: Ryo Chiba <ryochiba@gmail.com>  <br /><br />Thank you for your flattering words, that's very kind of you. <br /> <br />While I did make my site for my own dubious entertainment, it's nice to know that there are other people who like having a look at it.<br /> <br />Again, thank you, and have a nice day!<br /> <br />cheers,<br />Paul<br />----------------<br /><br />And I smile. One of my major idols decides to thank me. What an odd turn of events, and how flattering!<br /><br />*Note: Paul's site: http://artdevnull.com/index.html
