A bout of pneumonia is what has kept me from updating. It's starting to go away after my arduous two week journey through pain and suffering, but the antibiotics are the actual cause of recovery. <br /><br />I still can't believe that I "lost" an argument with Andrew one day a few days ago at lunch. I absolutely totaled his argument and raised mine to the level of acceptance, but did anyone pay any attention to what we were actually talking about? No, they were too busy laughing at me because I was sick at the time and was having difficulty talking. It's excruciatingly frustrating to try to convince people to agree with you when they can't even conceptualize what you are talking about because they are to busy ridiculing you. How terrible. They automatically assume that Andrew is always right. This is disgusting and vile. How dare they.<br /><br />Anyways, my band solo is coming along, but you don't care. I suck at clarinet anyways, so let us change the subject. Another thing to note in this little diary of mine would be my re-obsession with "Animal Crossing" which has made me an AC addict again. You probably don't even know what "Animal Crossing" is. Well, let's just say it would probably disgust you with its excentricity and obscene happiness. Everyone my age is supposed to be obsessed with drugs, sex, money, and violence anyways. It makes me feel out of place when playing a happy fun game with fluffy animals and sunny days in it. I suppose that conformity isn't always the answer. Who wants to be obsessed with drugs, sex, money, and violence anyways? Let's all play happy fun games with lots of rainbows. Emphasis on the rainbows.<br /><br />On Sunday, I decided to log on to my evil, putrid AIM account. Anything associated with American Online smells of filth, but I was testing my wireless connection. All in the name of Wi-Fi! So, I instant messaged this one person named "adancer." This person promply replied with some stupid, idiotic comment on how she was beautiful and blonde and all of that and it made me sick to think that people were this vain, but ,of course, I couldn't say that all since I can only type so fast with a stylus and a keyboard the size of my fingernail. I asked her name.<br /><br />Instantly, she became overly apprehensive and angry. Obviously technologically illiterate, she thought I could "hack" her computer if I got her name. How absurd. You don't need names to hack computers, idiot. Then, she decided to call her mean posse which consisted of inconsiderate spammers and general nuisances. They IM'ed me, and I openly gave out my name. They said I was a liar (I think I know my own name, people) and they promply started spamming me. Like I give a care. Stupid spammer Americanized wastrels. Absolutely Disgusting Filth.
