Another story from French class. <br /><br />Yesterday was like any other day in French. A substitute teacher passed out a worksheet to complete. Most of my peers, actually all of my peers, took about 20 minutes to finish it. I took about 45 minutes. I concentrated, slowly got through it, double checked everything, found a few mistakes, re-read the questions, underlined, circled, translated, and finally finished. Every word, each letter was pulled apart piece by piece and methodically looked at to see if it had any significant value. <br /><br />Because my grade is less than I would like it to be, I thought the extra effort would be worth it in the end. And so as I handed my worksheet in to the substitute teacher, and as I received odd stares from people who were done ages ago, I comforted myself with the promise that my grade would go up through my sacrifice of social acceptability. I sat down content.<br /><br />Today, I got that worksheet back. Because of the class' general consensus that we did not thoroughly understand this section, we went through and graded the worksheets together. Thirty minutes of droll overhead scribbles later, we finished grading our papers. I got my paper back and found that I had only missed one question.<br /><br /><i>Success! </i><br /><br /><b>Or so I thought</b>. When things had settled down after everyone got their paper back, the teacher explained that she gave this worksheet out to help our grades, because she does not give us a reasonable number of homework points. Everyone started complaining, and so she decided to make the unfortunate decision to take a vote. <br /><br />She asked, "How many people would be hurt by this worksheet?"<br /><br />The majority of the classroom raised their hands.<br />So, being the easily swayed teacher she is, she decided to forget about using the worksheet for points.<br /><br />And so fate was sealed. The wonderful worksheet that I had worked so hard on would not be collected, but instead put in my folder remaining a worthless sheet of paper. The hard work, all for nothing. All of those powerful, valuable, indispensable points, vanishing into thin air. And there was nothing I could do to stop it. It was the hands of the masses that were in control, not I.<br /><br />Sometimes, I feel helpless. No matter how hard I try, things don't fall in my favor.<b> Is the world really against me</b>?<br /><br />The fact that other people's inability to work hard has cost me my grade has just furthered my personal vendetta against the class itself. The one time I needed everyone to do well, they fail to do so. Every other time, the class average is far above mine. So why now? Why can't everyone just take their time on their worksheets? Why!? <br /><br />I'm hanging off of a cliff here, and I need a hand. Instead, I'm pelted with stones. Pelted with large stones with poisonous, red spiders on them.<br /><br />
