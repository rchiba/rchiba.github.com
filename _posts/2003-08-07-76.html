Hi everyone, its me again.  I am VERY sorry I haven't been updating.  But anyway, I registered for school yesterday and I luckily got a big locker and not  a small one.  The only bad thing is that me and Ryo practicly have no classes together, WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!  But do you know what all of this means?  SCHOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!  I DON"T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!  Well, I guess I'll go ponder over myself while school closes in on me.  See ya ;)
