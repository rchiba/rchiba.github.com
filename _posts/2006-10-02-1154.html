I hate it go away go away go away.<br /><br />Everything. At this time of night.<br /> <br />A post it note, a yellow one. On my wall, it tells me what I haven't done. So much, four, six, ten things. They have to get done, they are jobs. They are essential, essential to my education, I tell myself this. They aren't getting done. And there are only so many hours in a day, and so many hours in a week. So many seconds in a day, each one, many wasted. <br /><br />These aren't trivial mind you, they have to get done. The black ink from my pen, it can only write things for someone else. Obligations and deadlines, due dates and tests and quizzes and failed grades and that post it note on my wall. It <i>won't</i> go away. Just like everything else, it's all flooding into this tiny space of me that isn't tiny and isn't space. It's just hopeless.<br /><br />I sit here and can't think of where to start, where to take the knife and cut what is out of my mind and tape it to the paper, my thoughts are so messed up, can't think of these sentences that are supposed to make up my analysis, my composition, this blog post, my newspaper articles. Can't stop. To many failures to do that. I can't say it's hard. I'm sure there are a thousand, a million people who are doing harder things than me.<br /><br />There is a series of events that have to happen, I have to make them happen. I can't call it work. I put this upon myself. I'll call it recreation and blindly flail around in the dark, never getting anything done. False hope. Purposeless. Better things to do than sit around and wait to push a button to questions you'll <i>never</i> be sophisticated enough to understand. Better things to do than sit in a room with people who are just as "<i>swamped</i>" as you are. Better things to do than stress over articles that'll be discarded or ridiculed. Better things to do than feel stupid, and idiotic, and frustrated, for hurting someone's grade with your incompetence. And <i>better things to do than glare at the post it note. Curse, point, and gawk at it.</i> It stares back at me.<br /><br />I'm not swamped. The buck stops here.<br /><br />But, it'll end up not stopping here, and I'll feels guilty for telling you that. The buck will shoot me in the head and I'll be forgotten, and all of this will be for nothing. I've got better things to do than write this post and feel sorry for myself. Nothing ever gets done in this world.
