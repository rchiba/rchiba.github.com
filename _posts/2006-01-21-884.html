I can sleep and do my work later, or do my work later and sleep little. The choice is mine to make and I figure that the first choice is the most efficient.<br /><br />Although, doing my work later bothers me. The stress from having a pile of work to do sitting on the couch next to my bed usually keeps me from having a good night's sleep. On the other hand, if I went out of my way and did not sleep to get all the work done, I would be tired as well. I see it as a lose-lose situationf or me. Either way, I end up hating myself, humming the "I want to shoot myself in the leg" (alternatively called the "Jump off a cliff" song), and complaining to someone that doesn't exist (the readers of this). Even now, I'm seething with anger, resentment, and self-hate. Partially because I have spent about thirty minutes looking for a CD that I still haven't found. It's driving me nuts. My "Asian Kung-Fu Generation" CD has gone missing. I really want to listen to it. I absolutely hate it when I have an opportunity to use something I own, but can't due to my own stupidity. I suppose that's why I'm in this mood right now.<br /><br />I look at the little post-it note on my desk with tomorrow's to-do list on it. It's bothering me. Like a festering wound in my black-hole of a soul, the to-do list sits in my face, uncompleted. I only have one day to do it. I easily get distracted. It is imperative that I get it all done. It'll be a hit-or-miss situation. <br /><br />Please make me hit.
