My <em>Time</em> magazine came in today, just like it has every Wednesday of every week in the past. Those old airline miles that my father earned back in the day when Northwest wasn't bankrupt have come in handy in suscribing to <em>Newsweek</em> and <em>Time</em> magazine indefinitely. You wouldn't believe how many miles are in the account. I'll be current on world events for a while now.<br /><br />Anyways, in the magazine, there is an article discussing how children growing up in today's world are constantly "plugged into" something. Whether it be music player, instant messaging client, or cell phone, electronics fuel the lives of many young people.<br /><br />It worries me that we, as a society, are so dependent on something that can be taken away so easily, electricity. The crucial energy needed to power America runs through thin metal wires that snake throughout the country, being produced in select locations using polluting methods. One good strike could wrek havoc on the national power grid. Most people now consider electronic devices "necessities", so how would everyone react to no electricity? No computers, no washing machines, no light bulbs, no stereos, no televisions, no ceramic heater. Cellular systems shut down, airwaves silent. Ventilators in hospitals shutting down, traffic lights turning off, waste water treatment plants going bezerk.<br /><br />In the very unlikely chance that electricity will somehow disappear, chaos will ensue. And computer-fried children all over the world will lose their ability to say, "wassssup!!1!!1" to each other, lose the ability to make phone calls to each other concerning their clothing, and lose the ability to share bad, overly dramatic, emotional poetry with their friends. <br /><br />And, the world will have a reason to rejoice for a brief moment, until everyone realizes that having no electricity is bad.<br /><br />I have a lot to study, a lot to do. Skipping sleep entirely tonight seems like a viable option. I'll just see how things come out.<br /><br />In Chemistry today, I was being rather obnoxious to a friend because of my personal insecurities about knowing the material. Now I don't like myself. What I should have done is kept my insecurities to myself and trudge on, trying to learn everything in my own time, and not ask stupid questions to my peers. I was wasting their precious studying time asking my own selfish questions. How could I? I'm a horrible person, and I know it.<br /><br />Writing that paragraph makes me want to do unpleasant things. Now I'm in a temporary bad mood.<br /><br />-3 SELF-ESTEEM EXP
