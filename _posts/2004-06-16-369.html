Hey blog-thing. Know what? If I hear one more drunken burp I believe I shall go insane! UGH! The parents are drunk, again. Goodness it's getting annoying!
<br />Well, my day was a blast though. I went to summer gym, did Tai Chi and Yoga, which was SO much fun. Then I came home, walked for 64 minutes while watching 'Peter Pan' (lol, I know), and then I biked with a friend, nearly non-stop for about 3 hours! Oh yeah, I also biked half a mile on my own! Tonight I get to look forward to 40 sit-ups, lifting weights, and my wonderfully painful 'ab buster' BWAHAHAHA! 
<br />Yeah, ignore that laugh. Operation 'weight loss' is an official go. Everyday I walk for AT LEAST 32 minutes. YAAAAAAY! Usually it's 64 minutes. Then I try my best to do sit-ups and aerobic each and every night for a minimum of 15-30 minutes. YAY! HAPPY HAPPY ME! I can't BELIEVE I used to watch TV rather than take a nice, relaxing bike ride BOOYA! Or, when I'm angry, feeling sad, etc...I can't believe I used to eat @_@ Now it seems to strange. Eating right, a healthy exercise plan, and positive thinking are working! booya! 
<br />Anyways, there is my life in a nutshell for a while!

<br />P.S. Here's a fun fact. Did you know my lowest point was 196 pounds? UGH! And now, only a couple years later I'm on the right track and feeling so-so at 154! OVER 40 pounds I lost! BOOYA! ^^
