Hello, this is Ryo.
<br />There is little time to spare for I am preparing pre-launch preparations for the pilgirmage to Florida. I kind of sounded stupid there didn't I? lol... Anyways, like I said, I gotta go to florida and I am leaving RIGHT after school tomorow so I have to get ready. With it being aproximately 30 minutes untill I have to shut-down, I need to get ready. I am having trouble deciding on what I should bring though. Also, I have to get ready and organize my schoolwork which is getting very overwhelming. Oh well, I CAN DO IT. Piece of cake.... Ok, Ryan's gonna check for an update soon so I need to SPPEEED UP! Ok, on my agenda for the trip to Florida is to create a "Terms Of Service"for my website. Write some oppinions. And make up for all those missed days. For some reason, I really like writing now. It is like a hobby. Thanks all to my blog. In some ways I hate it though... Now everyone is making web pages, but of course I dont own the internet do I? Anyways,  I gotta update soon or ryan will miss this spectacle among spectacles of updation. Need to go so bye;)
<br />PS:VOTE ON MY NEW POLL NOW!!!
