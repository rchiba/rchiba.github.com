Installing software that costs money feels so foreign to me.<br /><br />Installing software that comes in a disk feels even more foreign.<br /><br />Actually picking up a physical disk and having to insert it into a drive to that the computer can spin it facinates me. The fact that there are factories out there in the world dedicated to printing these disks out dazzles me. I often wonder how much petroleum could be saved if all software was just shared from the Internet. When the drive hums from physical movement, when the hard drive clicks to pull data from the disk, why not just take it the software for what it is, an intangible string of data. I understand that there are many people in the world without the Internet, but why are store shelves still plastered with shiny, waxed boxes with disks in them?<br /><br />So this evening, as I was installing retail software on a machine that I thought was destined forevermore for open source goodies, I felt an odd skepticality floating about me. Such a foreign action for a such a routine thing. <br /><br />Installing software has kept me up. <br /><br />I predict that tomorrow will be busy. Not that today wasn't busy. <br /><br />Now that I think about it, it's not the busyness that's getting to my head, but the fact that I don't think the same way throughout the day anymore. I used to go through each class, focusing on each class individually, content with the present. But, now with my sleep debt, I go through the day looking forward to the next chunk of free time that will be spent dozing. Such times include Health class, lunch, and after school.<br /><br />Maybe it is because of times like these (when I stay up late updating this thing) that I must proceed with life yearning for time for rest.
