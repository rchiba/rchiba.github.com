I'll conform. I'll jump across the fence to the mad hell that I've been a staunch opponent of for years and years. The fence that has held me safe from the efficiency-sucking, evil powers. Yup, I've gone and done it.<br /><br />I've dived into the giant social networking pool, Myspace. Please don't vomit. <br /><br />After a few hours, I realized how stupid it is to scroll through an eight page list of "friends" to find people whom I want to designate as my friends. I think the whole "label people as your friends" concept just devalues the meaning of friendship. I mean, on the Internet, there is no such designation as <i>"acquaintance"</i> or <i>"friendly classmate"</i>, or <i>"what's his face"</i>, so usually all of these are clumped together with one's close friends to make a mega-super-ultra listing of all of the people who you are even remotely associated with. Even that old Jewish lady who was in front of you at the self-checkout lane last saturday. <br /><br />Some of the "profiles" end up being giant billboards where my peers flaunt their popularity, coolness, or unconformity. Actually, most of the profiles end up being giant, gaudy billboards. The place is a big melting pot of inflated egos, emotionally unstable people, and technologically challenged ass clowns. <br /><br />So, why did I join?<br /><br />That's a good question. It was a combination of <i>"I want to be a somebody"</i>, <i>"My girlfriend uses it"</i>, and <i>"Maybe if I make one, then a few more people might discover this blog."</i><br /><br />Whatever the case, I'm now officially "in".<br /><br />I wasted about four hours roaming around the myspace hellhole, so now I'm not justified in complaining about how busy I am. So shut me up if I do. I hate it when I'm a liar.
