Hi, this is ryo.
<br />I just came back from my stay at Kyles house. I am about to go to Shishirs house now, for his birthday party.
<br />Anyways, this remarkable thing happened while i went fishing with kyle, you have got to here it! Well, here it goes.
<br />Anyways, I saw something unbeliveble today. 
<br />It started at my friends house. He lives on a farm. Anyways, we decided to go fishing. We packed our stuff in his back pack and we started on our journey. We biked and biked and we did it for 30 miles. Since its flooding, the roads were flooded. We crossed over anyways. We finally got to this bridge and started fishing. My friend said he wanted to fish over down the bridge, so we went over there.
<br />I looked over slowly and I saw a car. It was a white car and it was driving pretty normally. But I kept on looking at it. Suddenly, the car went way out of control and swereved left to right, just like in those James Bond movies. Gravel was going everywhere and it was pretty scary. The car hit the side of the bridge and then hit the other side. Then it went into a spin and stopped. She backed up so she wasnâ€™t on the bridge because she might cause a worse crash. These people came out and got the person out and got some help. It was very scary. The car left tons of wreckage strewn about the street. And if the sides of the bridge were not as strong, then the car would go into the river. If my friend and I were standing in the same spot I stopped earlier, we would have been dead. Thank god for Kyle! I was very scared. 
<br />Well, tata;)
