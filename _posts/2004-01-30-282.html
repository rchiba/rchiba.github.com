This is the Average Yo
<br />I just realized that today is Friday and I am going to have to get through another crucial weekend.
<br />At school, I was called "weird" becaue I did my homework a bit early. I felt bad. Now I feel bad and I feel overloaded and I feel overwhelmed. But these are all feelings and they are deemed obsolete by me. Consequenly, I should not care, but human nature drives me on to actually care about my feelings. I felt like putting depressing music on this site, but I better not because it might scare off my readers (they are very sensitive). Anyways, I have to finish my speech, write the "Terms of Service" of this site (which ,by the way, I really want to write), and go to the gym (always a hassle). I feel unmotivated. I feel like sitting here and sleeping. I feel stupor coming on. I feel like my homework is overtaking me. I wonder if Alexia is reading this. More of a reason for me to be "weird". Oh well..
<br />
<br />Also, I've just realized how old this site is getting. I am going to keep it running as long as I can. Anyways, I get to take a tour of high school on tuesday. I am excited. It seems like high school is a hard game with your life on the line. You need forty credits for a general diploma and a core 40 diploma. You need forty-seven credits for an advanced honors diploma. If you get a high score (by racking up credits) you get to move on to the next level (college). I don't know if I'm ready for another game. Ughhh...
<br />
<br />As my stomach churns, the realization of my inevitable death encloses upon my soul. Just great, just great....
