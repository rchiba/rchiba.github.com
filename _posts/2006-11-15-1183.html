<i>Ding!</i><br /><br />I walk to the sink and spit out my toothpaste foam. Someone's at the door. Hurriedly hiding my toothbrush in my pocket, I peek out of the corner of the wall to see a dark figure. The figure shuffles from left to right, idly waiting for his call to be answered. I nervously turn on the front lights and open the door. Outside is chilly. I close the door to keep the warm air inside.<br /><br />In front of me stands a long haired male with an orange and grey hiking jacket and faded jeans. He looks like a college kid. Under his arm is a clipboard with a few sheets of gridded paper and a laminated map of the city. He shows it to me.<br /><br /><i>"I'm assuming your parents are the head of the household?"<br />"Yeah."<br />"Could you get them for me?"</i><br /><br />I walk to the master bedroom. My mother is busy drying her hair in front of a mirror.<br /><br /><i>"There's some petition guy at the door. He wanted to see you, but I'll deal with him."</i><br /><br />I walk back to the door to see the man glancing at the doorbell. No doubt he was just settling his eyes in a neutral area so he could think without distraction.<br /><br /><i>"My parents are busy and they told me I had to deal with it, so..."<br />"Well, I'm part of the Citizen Action committee and we're promoting the inclusion of more renewable energy in Indiana. Trying to change legislature, informing the public, stuff like that, you know?"<br />"Neat."<br />"It's something that you can support, and I'm collecting signatures for a letter, so could you...?"<br />"Sure thing."</i><br /><br />I sign the letter. He seems calm throughout it all. I'm reminded how nervous I would be if I were in his shoes. Going up to people and convincing them to do something was never one of my strengths. This guy can do it, and in a cold, dark, yuppie neighborhood nonetheless!<br /><br /><i>"So, how many signatures have you collected so far? It's a big neighborhood."<br />"Actually, I've just got ten. Just started on this area. I think I'll get a lot more as I go along though."<br />"Yeah, I've done this before, and it's hard. Walking around in the dark and stuff."<br />"This door-to-door thing keeps our overhead low and so,..."<br />"I can imagine, especially in these sorts of neighborhoods"<br />"Oh yeah, you're a student right? Do you have a spare ten dollars laying around? For that you could be part of our organization."<br />"No thanks, but do you have a website or something I could check out?"<br />"Sure thing."<br /></i><br />He hands me a sheet of paper and circles a block of text with a blue marker. I put it in my pocket with my toothbrush.<br /><br /><i>"You can donate through the website too, and there's neat stuff there."<br />"Thanks for the info, man. Sounds interesting."</i><br /><br />We shake hands. His grip is on the weaker side. I feel powerful being the one with the firmer grip. He starts walking away, I start closing my door, but I turn around when he gets to the road.<br /><br /><i>"Hey, and good luck with your signatures!"<br />"Thanks! Have a good night."</i><br /><br />I walk into my house and pull out the paper he handed me. Standing over the trash bin, I tear the paper rectangle into a shower of white flakes. Satisfied, I mutter to myself, "<i>Everyone's happy.</i>"
