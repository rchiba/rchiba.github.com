Am I dead or am I sleeping?<br /><br />I went to Michigan City, Indiana today. Anyone see the oxymoron? Anyone?<br /><br />Ok, time to recap. Nothing to recap. Panic.<br /><br /><br />Tomorrow is the beginning of school. I'm a bit happy. Being back on a routine with other people my age pleases me. And, I get to talk so awesome people. People that I wish were my friends. People who are just fantastic. I can't immagine being like them. Everyday, I strive for the impossible standards set by them.<br /><br />Enough idolism. <br /><br />You know what? Dance Dance Revolution brings me great frustration. I've always had that problem. Same thing happened with tennis. I would get frustrated and explode. If anyone's seen the movie "Falling Down", then you know what I mean. It's a good movie. Rent it or something. <br /><br />That reminds me, I better update my profile.
