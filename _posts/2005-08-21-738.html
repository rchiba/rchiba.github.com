It's funny how you can look at your watch and find yourself speeding through time.<br /><br />Actually, it's not that funny, because it means that you're speeding toward your ultimate demise. Death by fire, cancer, car accident, or cat on a stick. Isn't it terrible? Well, let's hope time isn't going fast for you. Because speed isn't an advantage in time.<br /><br />Derr... This weekend was full of learning experiences. I'm using my life in the metaverse as a tool to learn how to communicate better. Be a better socializer. As you must all know by now, because of both my ranting and my description of my social life, I'm quite shy. Hopefully the metaverse will be able to help me experiment and learn social cues. I know I'm not the only one in there trying to do that. I mean, me being in the furry fandom, I'm a "freak" and you know it. I mean, it's set in stone, but hey. Why not make the best of it?<br /><br />Now, time to read some furry webcomics and get some sleep.
