Kaiser Andrew didn't show up to Buffalo Wild Wings to chill' wit' da' QuizBowl homies. How disappointing...<br /><br />I've been practicing my speech on Mao Zedong, but it's only three minutes. It needs to be about 7 minutes. I feel very pressured. Under pressure.<br /><br />The air seems hostile today. I don't know how air can feel hostile, but it does. A harsh tone to it. Not the smell, but rather the texture. Yes, air has a texture. I can feel it.<br /><br />I'm not crazy.
