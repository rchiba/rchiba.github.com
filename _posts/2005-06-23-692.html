I suppose that I'm in emotional turmoil right now. I got in an argument with my father about his rash personality after work. He's always blaming the governemnt about all his woes. He seeks revenge at every corner. I am afraid he will become some psycho vigilante. Why can't he forgive and forget? Revenge only causes future complication. Revenge can't solve past injustices, but it can easily create new ones for the future. <br /><br />He says that I don't appreciate him enough for the "bullshit" he goes through. Then, he goes on to use as many expletives he can. Cussing doesn't justify some irrational anger. Be happy with what you have. I'm quite worried that he may develop hypertention and suffer a heart condition. It's ironic because he's always talking about how Japanese people have superior genetics. Doesn't he see that it doesn't matter how long you live if your life is miserable and angry? There's no point in convincing him of anything because everything I do is supposedly, "bullshit" to him. What, my driving courses? Complete bullshit. My stunning grades? Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. <br /><br />How am I supposed to be more grateful if he can't see me trying hard? Everyone is better than me to him. He can't be perfect, so he takes it out on me. He says I don't understand. I work so hard to impress him, but I can never succeed in exceeding his expectations. I'm on the verge of tears now, and I don't want to admit it. I snap my fingers when I get nervous. I'm having trouble because my hands are shaking.<br /><br />If he can't see that I try, he doesn't have to. I'll just keep trying and maybe someday someone will notice. Maybe someone will care about me someday.<br /><br />Grr... I hate emotions. I get caught up and I can't breathe. Posting and writing about my woes usually calms me down, but it's not helping.<br /><br />Ok, life is happy. My life is great. If I get angry, or sad, or any way emotional, then he has succeeded in spreading his rash attitude problem. I won't stand for it. I'll force myself to be happy.<br /><br />I'm happy.
