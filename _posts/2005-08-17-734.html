My parents pushed a tough question on me today.<br /><br />"What do you want to do when you're older?"<br /><br />Well, the problem with this is that I have no idea. I have experimented in sketching, and it has been merited "hobby" status. I'm not sure if it could ever result in a career. I like computers, but any job involving computers is as stable as a one-legged 'Nam veteran. And plus, I know like a trillion other kids who are much more into computers than I am. Same with my sketching. There will always be more than a handful of kids who are better than me at that. I was thinking about a career in journalism. Journalism class last year made me realize that journalism is a hardcore toughie. Needless to say, I struggled. Struggled lots.<br /><br />How about a career in science? I was never excellent at that either. I am a very imprecise person. My handwriting looks like some elementary school kid puked on the page after eating tainted food at "snack time." Grape juice and oatmeal cookies. Not pretty when regurgitated. <br /><br />How about medicine? Well, that would be the easiest path to take, but I really don't have a "passion" about healthcare. I mean, helping people is just fantastic, but I don't have the supposed "passion" that people are supposed to have with their jobs. My father knows the ins and outs of healthcare, so I would have a one-up over the competition with that. He's always talking about how easy it is to be a doctor these days. Sounds do-able when he talks about it. Medicine and healthcare is a very stable job since people will be always hurting, or getting hurt.<br /><br />What else is there? I suppose there are limitless opportunities, but none of these "opportunities" really drives me. I'm on a highway to life, without a trusty GPS system to navigate me. Just a bunch of billboards.<br /><br />On the other hand, I could just become a runaway and live an illegitimate life on the streets. Maybe in a boxcar. Scrounging what I can from a local office supply shop and convenience store. The advantage with that is... <br /><br />I suppose there isn't an advantage. Time to rethink all of this.<br /><br />What could I be?
