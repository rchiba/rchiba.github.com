Ok, another day in the eyes of An Average Yo
<br />Ryan is deciding to update his page today, hooray! Rejoice! Anyways, Ryan was telling me about how I shouldn't say kill or destroy forever and whatnot. Ok, so for all those adults reading this, DON'T TAKE THOSE WORDS LIKE I AM A PHYCO, IT IS A FIGURE OF SPEACH!!!! IS THAT CLEAR!?!?! Ok, what else to talk about. Oh yea, I don't want to go to the gym today. I don't, but I have no control over the inevidable. Recently there has been of traffic to my site and I would like to say REJOICE FOR THE YOMIESTA! Ok, anyways, I am officialy known as "Stampy" in math class. It is because I really like the graph stamp that the teacher has and now I have a unlimited membership to the "Happy Fun Graph Stamp Club"! Whoopahh!!! Huzzah!!! I am happy! Ok, what else, oh yea, I aced all the tests that came my way (except english) My science scores are skyrocketing because of my "new science inniciative". I got six 100%s in a row! Huzzah for me! Oh yea, I'm going to John's church for a "Lock-In" I wonder if there are fire exits. If the church starts burning, we are all dead as honey roasted chickens. He says that you get souped up on caffiene at the church. Thats not healthy. I hope I don't go insane there. I usually go insane when I'm locked up with a room full of strangers souped up on caffiene. It's scary dude. What else is there? Hmmm... Oh yea, any game freaks reading this should go and download "Aces High" and play it. It's free and fun. IT's a flight sim. Totally radical! Anyways, I hope Kyle's B-day goes well. Its this weekend.  Happy B-day Kyle! Ok, I think thats all. so PEACE OUT
<br />;)
