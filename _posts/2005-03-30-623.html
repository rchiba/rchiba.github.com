What do you do when you're bored and the only thing you can turn to is the Internet? Well, obviously you turn to spam and "get-rich-quick" schemes. It's day two of my "Inbox Dollars" escapade and my balance is at $17s. I'm over halfway to my goal. My spam is growing exponentially. I think it's time to celebrate. Spam is fun for everyone!<br /><br />I put a link to the "Inbox Dollars" thing if you are bored and want to see if you can earn some cash (I'm skeptical), but hey, if you sign up in my name, I'm supposed to get cash. If you don't like me or don't want to support me, then don't click the link. Foos.<br /><br />Anyways, I put Ryan's comic link on (He's estatic about this kind of stuff) so check it out. I'm not liable for any eye injuries.<br /><br />Maybe I'll get rich quick tomorrow...
