HI, it's me again.  Basketball tryouts started Monday.  That's one reason why I haven't been updating lately.  Anyway, I learned a few veerrryyy interesting things today.  But, I will not dispose of this information for i have sworn not to.  Other than that, things have been pretty normal.  The worst thing was having to be at school at 6:45am for tryouts because the chior at to do something after school that made us have to play in the morning. Prior to my previous surgery, MY NOSE HAS BEEN GETTING BETTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!  Sorry about that.  I cna finally breath through my nose!  YAAAAAAAAAAY!!!  I don't know why I'm tell you all this because it doesn't make any difference in YOUR life.  But I don't really care.  Like Ryo says, I'm writing down MY thoughts.  I'm only writing what  I think.  What I write on this blog has no affect on your life whatsoever.  That's all I've gotta say today and just to let you know, the only reason I wrote all that stuff was because I had to get some things off my chest.  That doesn't matter to you of course though.  Oh well, I'm still gonna write.  LATER!!!
