Shooting my foam dart gun at the ceiling fan amuses me greatly. Each time I pull the spring back and slowly depress the trigger. The loud click that comes from plastic ramming into plastic, which rams into foam. The forceful pang of the suction cup end of the dart impacting the fan. The fan blade vibrating from the impact, slowly stopping. The orange foam cylinder tumbling in the air to the carpet. All of these things are events that I find great joy in. <br /><br />And so I pick up the dart and repeat the process.<br /><br />But, in another way, I hate myself for it. The absurdity of it all frustrates me. I accomplish nothing in this senseless act of mock-violence. However, my primal urge to shoot foam projectiles at a simple device designed to circulate air throughout my room overrides my need to do worthwhile things. Shooting again and again. With no point. Pulling the spring, and pulling the trigger. Pulling and pulling... Purposeless.<br /><br />Failure to have a purpose is a failure to be a person, to have life, to be anyone.<br /><br />How exceedingly emotional, these words I write. I am rather ashamed.<br /><br />The further I pursue this topic, the worse I feel. <br /><br />Today was supposed to be great, grand, august (or so my vocabulary book tells me), magnificent, splendid, glorious, brilliant, and a number of other synonyms that I don't care to look up. But, now the digits on the clock that sits timidly on the right side of my taskbar read "11:33AM". This day that was given to me to do my favorite things, the day that was given to me so I could do the things I always wanted time to do, this wonderful day, has already half-passed away. And here I sit, as the last digit advances like a bus that has no stop to fulfill.<br /><br />This bus continues on a destined path, forgetting about my simple need to ride it, passes me by and the world continues to turn as I wallow in my own disgusting puddle of self-pity.<br /><br />That, my friends (and acquaintances) is a lovely sentence.
