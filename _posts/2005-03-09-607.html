I'm excited since I have much information to write today.<br /><br />First off, I'm going to take those broken links off of the links section because their making me angry. Those stupid unprofessional broken links. Grr...<br /><br />Second off, I can't wait to put up some new links to replace the broken ones. Leisure World will be one of them.<br /><br />Anyways, I was talking to my dad after he asked me if I've ever played the "Grand Theft Auto" line of games. He talked about how some black kid was obsessed with it and killed a police officer after stealing a car. The police officer's family is suing Rockstar Games and Sony. <br /><br />I believe such blame on an inanimate object is extremely short-sighted. I've played "Grand Theft Auto I", "Grand Theft Auto II", "Grand Theft Auto III".... I've played EVERY SINGLE ONE! Am I going on a killing rampage outside? No. The simple answer is this. A variety of factors probably influenced this child besides "Grand Theft Auto". The effect of this game is absolutely negligent. He either had problems with his cognitave ability or faced instability within his life. GTA did not cause him to kill a police officer. Life did. <br /><br />Plus, people are killed when using plastic spoons, peanuts, and vacuum cleaners. How is a few deaths by video game so terrible? Is it enough for mass panic, lawsuits, and the banning of fun games? It absolutely is not. It's so extremely irrational. It's one of those things the general public is stupid about. I just want to get some parents and have a "Where To Put Your Blame 101" class. <br /><br />The reaction with violent video games is just like the irrational reaction of holiday vacationers. If a plane crashes, everybody panics and spends hundreds of hours and millions of dollars investigating the cause. News networks swarm the 10 mile radius. The TV blares menacing warnings. You see a hundred instant replays of the crash and following fire. Everybody is scared. Everybody....<br /><br />GOES ON A ROAD TRIP! What could be safer than nice pavement. Nice pavement, 2 ton hummers driven by other people just like you! Of course a license for driving a car can be obtained by a person by the likes of me, and a pilot's license takes years of study, diligence, and certification, but that's beside the point! What could be safer than a SUV driven by a drunk teenager? What could be safer than driving behind a 16-wheel mega-truck driven by a drowsy trucker? I'll tell you what could be safer...<br /><br />Air travel is safer, stupid idiot. It's quite safe to say that riding in a airplane is MUCH safer than in a car. What does the "general public" do? They drive. Stupid, stupid, stupid...<br /><br />Just like that scenario, it is safe to say that GTA is not killing our youth. I mean, WHO HASN'T played GTA some time or another. I believe that at least %80 of all teens have experienced the awesomeness of GTA and have gone on a week GTA binge. If what the lawyers, parents, and professors say is true, then 80% of teenagers would be going on killing rampages, while the world would end and total anarchy and chaos would ensue. That hasn't happened.<br /><br />Maybe that kid played GTA, and maybe he killed a police officer. But I know that holding a plastic spoon in my hand is much more dangerous than playing GTA.
