Well, I went to the whole optimist speech thing, lost, and I guess I am glad about it all.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />Anyways, I went to MCL cafeteria which is a really great place to eat. My comrade Brady won and gets to go to the next round. He has a pretty good chance of winning the $1,500 scholarship. If he wins it, I might just get a tad envious (actually, much more envious).  Oh well. Let me sumarize it in this saying. 
<br /><"Losing in the Optimist Club Oratoracle Competition is like getting food from a buffet. You might haven't got the banana pudding, but at least you got the blue jello. Plus, you get seconds" -Average Yo>
<br />So, I'm pretty satisfied. now I have more time to sit at my computer and wallow in my self pitty. Too bad the whole speech team is done for and mathcounts done for also. Now I have a TON of time to sit here in front of my computer and wallow in my own self-pitty. Anyways, to sumarize my whole ordeal here, I learned alot of skills doing this competition. My public speaking skills have VASTLY improved. It's like speaking in front of my peers is like an everyday thing now. I should be really happy. I know many who still are really, extremely, unbearebly terrible at speaking in front of an audience. I mean, we had these speech things in communications class, and boy, were the speeches terrible. Anyways, I learned and have improved myself. I still have my whole life in front of me to try to strive in excellence.

<br />Speaking about my whole life, in communications class, we have to do this huge career powerpoint thing. It is over one career and we are supposed to gather a ton of data on it and research it. I also get to take a test thing that will chose a career for me. I'm scared, but if I get to do work that I like, I'm fine with it. I'll most likely live alone with a bookshelf and a comfortable chair. Ahhhhh, what a nice existance. Who needs friends when you have books and the internet and a blog to take care of? I sure don't. Well, time is running short and with time running short also comes a goodbye.
<br />Goodnight ;)
