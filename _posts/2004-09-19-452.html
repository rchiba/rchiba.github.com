This weekend was a perfect autumn weekend. The sky was blue, the air was sweet, and the temerature couldn't have been any better. Although, back in 'bama, their still without power after the hurricane past over. The list of activities done this weekend?
<br />1.Go to quiz bowl meeting at BW3's
<br />2.Go to park with Ryan and watch him do crazy stunts
<br />3.Go to Devin's house to meet Nate and go to his mother's birthday party
<br />4.Hang out with Ryan at my place
<br />
<br />That's about it, too much social activity for me. I'm not used to going to these "party" things. I mean, I don't even get invited to any social occasions many times, let alone "parties". Call me anti-social, but sometimes "parties" are just to chaotic. I'm not talking about Devin's party, just parties in general.
<br />
<br />On a side note, my computer has contracted a very annoying worm that replicates itself and pops up windows and takes up system memory. It also gets me very agrivated. I am currently trying to destroy them, but they just keep propagating. This is probably happening because I was using IE earlier today with ryan. That evil, evil browser. Well, wish me luck on my spyware destroying escapade.
<br />
<br />Anyways, this weekend has come to an end and next week is the week for ISTEPS. Yay.
