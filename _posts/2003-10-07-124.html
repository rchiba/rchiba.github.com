I got my glasses today. 
<br />Everyone will see them on wednesday. I am afraid for some reason. I can't write much because I am restricting the time I am on the computer so my eyesight doesn't get worse. I didn't have much homework today and the Math test was soooo EASY! I think 8th grade is a synch. Piece of cake. So, what is your opinion on this. Send your opinions to averageyo@mostlysunny.com!
