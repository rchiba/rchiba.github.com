Today was just one of those days.<br /><br />One of those days where you just feel like slumping into an office chair in your room and dying. The kind of day that wastes no time making you feel inferior, insecure, and lost. A day full of unanswered questions and fear of being substandard compared to peers.<br /><br />Yes, it was that kind of day.<br /><br />Throughout the day I felt terrible. <br /><br />Actually, that was a lie. I felt great during the beginning of school. My self-created "system" started falling apart in Chemistry. People were ahead, I was falling farther and farther behind. "Everyone else" was understanding abstract ideas that I was just starting to understand. People were finished, and I was lagging behind. By the end of the class, I was rushing to finish a quiz that I ended up failing. The teacher berated me on how I should do this all "on my own". I scrambled out the door and took a sharp right. A sharp right turned out to be a bad idea. I tripped over some girl who was crouching down to open up her locker. It was terrible, and all my fault. The worst thing about this was that I didn't have the time to properly apologize. I just snatched my books and muttered a quick "sorry". As I cut in and out of the crowd, I couldn't help feeling guilty and sad. Guilty and sad about how blatantly impolite and inferior I was to that girl. I still remember her glaring look and my attempts to block this look from my mind as I flew down the stairs and took a snappy left at the bottom of the hallway intersection. As the day dredged on, the terrible feelings could only grow exponentially.<br /><br />My extracurricular activity didn't help with any of these stupid idiot feelings either. The problem with the QuizBowl members is that they constantly criticize themselves. Bickering and fussing over missed questions always frustrates me. I'm sitting in the middle of everybody, and they all talk about how stupid they are, and how they have terrible minds. I sit there, and take it all in. The cold, hard facts say that I'm the weakest link. I never answer any questions, and I'm a terrible leader. If anyone's going to be kicked off of the team, it's going to be me. And so, the bickering continues and continues. People who are obviously more competent than me continue to criticize themselves. Soon after the practice, I'm a mental wreck. I can't think about anything else besides my hideous "feelings". I try to shove and cram it into a dark, damp corner of my mind, but it keeps regurgitating itself into the spotlight. A lump of hard flesh begins to form in my throat. Breathing becomes constricted, and here I am, trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying like a weak, insecure five-year old girl. What kind of fifteen year old guy cries? That's right, no one, or at least that's the message society tries to convey. <br /><br />So, back to my absurd life story. <br /><br />By the time I know it, I'm in my room. Obviously contemplating suicide. After all, what kind of teenager hasn't? I mean, you have to admit, everyone has at one time or another, contemplated suicide. Bad things happen, so why not turn to non-existance? Well, for one thing, I would rather exist than not exist. A primal instinct tells me so, but besides that there are a number of logical reasons to stay alive. So, I stop thinking about it. Brush all of my emotions aside for two hours. Homework is more important than my value of life. <br /><br />Alarming isn't it? Well, don't be alarmed. I won't be dead anytime soon. It's not like I would have the courage to do such a thing. <br /><br />So, two hours pass and I'm finished with my homework. I sit here in a curled up ball, in my office chair, typing. It's really nice to have an outlet for all of this nonsense. <br /><br />At the moment, I feel secure. <br /><br />But you know what they say. History repeats itself. Let's just hope that today didn't make history.
