Once again, I have recieved a letter to a pageant show. A pageant show to supposedly, "meet new friends, boost your self-confidence, and win prizes." I'm supposed to meet with other "young women" at a hotel down in Indianapolis. I'm assumimg that this contest is for "young women." I am not a "young woman." I have called this pageant company before, requesting removal from their mailing list. I guess they haven't removed me. So I suppose I'll just keep getting these invitations to beauty pageants. Their letters sure aren't helping my self-esteem. That's for sure.<br /><br />If this company really wanted to help people, they wouldn't spam male teenagers and invite them to beauty pageants. They would send the money to underdeveloped countries to help starving children. If stupid stinking rich corporations and sponsors want beautiful teenaged girls to be awarded cash, then no wonder people just keep on starving, this country keeps falling deeper and deeper into debt, and meth is a national problem. It's because this culture is shallow. Shallow like a puddle. A big puddle seems like a lake until you jump in and you realize that the people that the puddle represents are too shallow to even give a/an (INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE.) Such shallow morals, shallow ethics, shallow life. People bickering with each other about Terry Schaivo. Bickering over a brain-dead vegetable, while people are killing each other everywhere. Look at your dirtied hands, you rascals. Set your priorities straight. <br /><br />But, alas. Like many high-school adolescents, adults fail to recognize that some things are worth more merit and effort than others. Whether it be a teenager playing GTA instead of working on homework, or some adult bickering about Terry Schaivo, there is always a person somewhere doing something that isn't exactly up to par with reason. Is there no reason?
