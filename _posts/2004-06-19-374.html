Ryan is cutting/pasting his way to a html...nightmare. Hopefully, he'll clean up his act and make it more user friendly.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />
<br />I didn't do much today, so I'll take out one of my rainy day topics.
<br />
<br />At summer gym, you meet alot of people. Most of them weird or otherwise oddball. I didn't know there would be so many. 
<br />
<br />There are certain people when it comes to subjects. There are people who firmly believe in something because they know alot about it. There are people who firmly believe in something because they DONT know alot about it. There are also those who are just vegetables, rarely thinking of anything besides their girlfriend or another social topic. I have met so many people who are in the second group. Who firmly believe in something because they DONT know alot about it. From video games, to websites, to WWII, and the war in Iraq, there are so many people who don't understand what is going on. They hear something on TV, and they believe it. These people listen to a friend's, cousin's, uncle's, brother's confession to a topic, and they believe it. I hate it. People have no idea about economies, social classes, other reliegeons, and general situations that aren't in the US. Also, they have no authority to judge things, like video games. They say it's "fun". They say this over and over and over again, and to my utter disbelief, they ACTUALLY THINK that I'm interested in the game after they have used one VERY poor adjective to describe a retarded game. 
<br />
<br />
<br />People are also inconsiderate. I ask someone about WWII and they go laugh about how Japan got bombed. They KNOW I'm japanese, they KNOW that millions got killed, but they don't know how to be polite, AT ALL! They laugh, and they don't even notice me not laughing. I don't want to laugh, and I don't see how they CAN. Millions of innocents die, and those ingrates scoff. They should be put through the torture, battles, and injustices past generations have had to experience. Let them grow up, get their jobs at the factory and live in a trailer home. I can't wait.
