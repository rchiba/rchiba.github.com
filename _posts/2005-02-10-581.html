I just figured something out. 
<br />
<br />Maybe depressed an suicidal people are really just bored. I mean, now that I'm busy with two extracurricular activities, I'm not really that depressed anymore. There are things that are occupying my time. These things stress me out, but at least I'm not suicidal. Yes, my plan is to incarcerate all of those suicidal and depressed people and make them go to an all-year summer camp where they can enjoy crafts, fishing, and mud. I don't know where all of this money to fund this project will come from, but I'm sure it'll combat their suicidal tendancies.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I didn't dive today because it was a 3 team meet, and only 2 divers were allowed per team. That was pretty cool, because it enabled me to become the cameraman. Unfortunately, the pool was so dark that pictures turned out to be a bad idea. I took movies instead.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I think my Orientation to Life and Careers book is the most hilarious thing I have ever read. The laughter and short-term joy comes from the obviousness of the things the book says. Chapter titles include, "Good Attitudes", "Punctuality", and "Grooming". The most hilarious part about all of this is that the book treats the reader as if they have no idea what work is. They're like, "If you want to go to work, show up on time!" and I'm like, "No duh." and the book is like, "If you want to  get a job, then don't smell like windex and old lunch meat." and I'm like, "No duh." and this cycle goes on for ages until I either get bored of the book, or until I can't stop laughing from the idiocracy of it all.
<br />
<br />I really want a CD player, but I'm not sure about buying one. I know it's like $5 to buy one from wal-mart, but $5 for me is a big financial decision. I'll probably just use other people's cd players for now. Maybe, I could invest my money in a boombox. I don't know. I'm just kind of flowing with it all.
<br />
<br />Just go with the flow man...
