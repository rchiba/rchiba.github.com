Sometimes I wonder about how I want to live my life.<br /><br />I was entertaining becoming a volunteer for MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders. Entertaining the idea of going out of my comfort zone to help dying people in dangerous areas rampant with war, disease, and crime. Entertaining the idea of sacrificing the very comforts that I enjoy and hold dear every day. To become someone for the sake of becoming someone. <br /><br />Plus, I hear that they're constantly needing French-speaking volunteers. Just another incentive to try to learn French. (Which is becoming increasingly difficult)<br /><br />But, of course, as all ideas come to a screeching halt, I ask myself, "Should I keep this in my head?" Because, if I keep things locked into my head, then I begin to work towards these things. Whether I do it subconsciously, or consciously, I slowly begin to drift towards the message that I lock into my head. <br /><br />So, due to my facination with <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Experime1940">such things</a>, I'm reading <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/voices/2004/09-2004_sudan.cfm">an account of an MSF volunteer. </a><br />Great, now I'm not going to get it out of my head.
