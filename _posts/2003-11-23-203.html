Well, the talent show tryouts are coming up and I've got plans. Unfortunately, my partner is playing with legos so I can't practice. I'm thinking of working alone, but the act would be alot better with 2 people. I don't know what to do. I also need to get justin to bring his costume on monday, or else....

<br />Anyways, I'm writing this while listening to 1990's dance music. Does that make me stupid? I can't think of anytning while listening to music. Anyways, I made an advice page. To get to it, first go to the homepage and then click "Here is my advice". I am planning to take a notebook to school so I can think of more advice. I know I have tons of ideas, but I forget them. I really need to get with Shishir. 
<br />
<br />I also have to study for a test in French. It's over numbers. Ok let me try to remember. un, duex, trois, quatre, cinq, six, set, huit, nuef, dis.... Gosh, I gotta work on that. I have to remember numbers 1-70 and how to put them together, like Ilya bla bla bla...
<br />
<br />Anyways, Today seems to be cloudy. I have also remembered the career I want to persue. Unfortunately, I forget it, strangely enough. I want to persue a career that has to do something with the brain. I don't know what though. A neuroreasercher? I don't know. There are so many paths...
<br />Which one will I take?
