Hello, its Ryo again. My friend is coming over in a few minuites. I am anxious to see him. Anyways, I just made a kool home-page for my self. It is still in the works. I also just cleaned my dog, its cage, and watered the lawn(BY HAND!). It was long and hard work, but watering the lawn was pretty fun! I got wet though and had to take a shower. I sure got a lot of vitamin D today! I am waiting and waiting for Kyle. Well, I don't have anything else to write so I gotta go.
