My Linux installing adventure has cost me so much time I have little to update.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to go to some vacation in Michigan or somewhere. Great, not. Hopefully I'll be able to get back early enough to network my computers more. That's all for now. Expect me back on Sunday afternoon.
