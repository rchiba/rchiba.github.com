Middle school wasn't filled with as many gamer-types. I was a stereotypical Nintendo fanboy. Most kids were newbie Xbox-lovers, and so there wasn't anyone to talk to about Nintendo consoles. The console itself wasn't that much to talk about, and quickly fell into 3rd place due to a number of reasons. Features, game selection, and non-standard disk format all contributed to the Gamecube's ultimate demise. Sad thing, really. Yes, one could look at the numbers and say that they sold decently, but who wants to be in 3rd place?<br /><br />Let's flip back to today. Being the time of year it is, everyone's fritzed about the new consoles, the new features, the new partnerships, and the new rivals. The new <b>everything</b>. E3 is going on this week, so I wasn't so surprised when I logged onto digg.com and found a bunch of articles on game consoles being on the top of the list. But, with each new click of the "next page" link for more articles, there were more and more article titles that excited me.<br /><br />Back in the day, I was a true, blue gamer. I read the magazines, lurked the forums, spread the rumors, knew the lingo, and bought the merchandise. As I entered high school, and even before that, games started to become just that. Games. <b>Simple, childish diversions</b> to occupy one's spare time. With homework increasing, and spare time decreasing, games became something that only dwelt in my past. Something childish, something mindless, and something that didn't make any sense. I had better things to do than mindlessly push buttons on a machine. I still think like this.<br /><br />Whenever I find myself in a game store, I feel disgusted that I used to be part of this subculture. Reminded of all of the hours I wasted on these trivial entertainment machines, I always manage to get a gritty taste of shame from my past. Yet, at the same time, the games still have their old charm on me. They are much like drugs. A gamer will never be cured of the addiction, no matter how much rehabilitation takes place. I've been mostly sober, but it's hard. Just looking at all of the pretty flip-open game covers, reading the alluring features of a certain game, make me want to sell everything in my room and buy games, and just play them forever. The buzz that comes from playing a brand new game is matched by none other. Drooling over the games, I eventually come to my senses.<br /><br />I remind myself that games aren't part of my life anymore. I remind myself that my life is enough of a game as it is.<br /><br />But, the articles that I mentioned above, the articles at digg.com, they brought back the buzz from the comfort of my own home. Front page articles include:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.nintendojo.com/infocus/view_item.php?1147230320" title="Ubi Director Commends Wii, Shuns PS3" target="_blank"><i>"Ubi Director Commends Wii, Shuns PS3"</i></a> </li><br /><li><a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/706/706955p1.html" title="Duck Hunt 2!" target="_blank"><i>"Duck Hunt 2!"</i></a> </li><br /><li><a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/706/706951p1.html" title=""Resident Evil (Wii exclusive)"" target="_blank"><i>"Resident Evil (Wii exclusive)"</i></a> </li><br /><li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/digitalentertainment/2006/05/10/nintendo-e3-strategy-rr_cx_0510game.html" title=""Wii for under $200?"" target="_blank"><i>"Wii for under $200?"</i></a> </li><br /><li><a href="http://digitalbattle.com/2006/05/09/e3-nintendo-press-conference/" title=""Wii Controller (Remote) showcases 'Doppler Effect'"" target="_blank"><i>"Wii Controller (Remote) showcases 'Doppler Effect'"</i></a> </li><br /><li><a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/707/707077p1.html" title=""E3: Image of the REAL "light gun" peripheral for the Nintendo Wii"" target="_blank"><i>"E3: Image of the REAL "light gun" peripheral for the Nintendo Wii"</i></a> </li><br /><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wnkLKgfgQ" title=""Super Mario Galaxy Gameplay + Nintendo Booth From E3!"" target="_blank"><i>"Super Mario Galaxy Gameplay + Nintendo Booth From E3!"</i></a> </li><br /><li><a href="http://www.gamersreports.com/media/561/" title=""Nintendo Wii Virtual Console Images"" target="_blank"><i>"Nintendo Wii Virtual Console Images"</i></a> </li><br /><li><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/10/nintendos-e3-booth-tour/" title=""Take a Tour of Nintendo's E3 Booth"" target="_blank"><i>"Take a Tour of Nintendo's E3 Booth"</i></a></li></ul><br /><br />But, the most exciting, and joyous news of all is <a href="http://opera.com/pressreleases/en/2006/05/10/" title=""Opera confirms: Their browser will be on the Wii"" target="_blank"><i>"Opera confirms: Their browser will be on the Wii"</i></a>! My gaming idol from the past joins my browser idol of today, what could be more perfect? <br /><br />A sign in my English classroom says, "A setback is just a set up for a comeback." Perhaps the signs aren't just lies meant to deceive me into being motivated after all.
