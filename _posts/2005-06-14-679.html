Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away...<br /><br />There was a boy. A boy with magical powers and a stereotypical anime script to follow. The boy was named, "Chronoboy" and looked like a grungey, dark version of the popular, astroboy. Chronoboy arduously treked through time and space to infiltrate the faraway planet of Earth.<br /><br />Upon his arrival to Earth, he was worshiped as an anime character. His supposed "voice actors" were heralded as heroes and he was a regular on such networks as Cartoon Network and the International Channel. Chronoboy was soon enveloped by popular culture and was poisoned by the deep sins of our society. Chrono soon became a morbidly obese shut-in who lived in the ghettos of the Bronx. And that's where the story of my life starts.<br /><br />Not really, but that is the kind of nonsense I come up while half-sleeping in a crowded airport. Hopefully, my trip to Japan will not incurr such mental damage on myself once again. Please, let me be spared.
