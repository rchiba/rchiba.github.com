Hey blog-thing. I know it seems like I only update when I'm really busy or upset, but the truth is that those are usually the only times I have time. What is the problem now, blog-thing? My sister could be caught up ina&nbsp; drug trying. Yes, you heard, me, she might be selling drugs. How do I know? For one, she is the only one who could have stolen my grandmothers pills, and two, she was really open about a mysterious phone call. She couldn't tell us about it because she said we'd get her into trouble. 
<br />OF course, and I know this seems strange, I am not able to release the emotions I know I have somewhere deep inside. I'm almost scared to think I might have buried my emotions too far... 
<br />On other note, I might be starting another story or blog called 'Tales from the current day Mafia'. As that is what I think my old family is. A Mafia, a present day Mafia full of lies, deceit, and drugs. But I will still continue to diligently update. 
<br />Goodday blog-thing; 
<br />~Amanda
