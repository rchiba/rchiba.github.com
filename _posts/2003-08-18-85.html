Hello, its 4:15 PM. Just back from school. I am sipping a orange juice carton and listening to techno, feeling depressed. I always feel depressed, but try not to show it. I finally have time to write a full fledged diary entry so lets start. Anyways, I dont have many friends. People say that you have to hang out (go to their house once in a while) with them for them to be a real friend. I dont have many friend, especially in my neighboorhood. Maybe that is why I am typing to a webpage that no-one will ever read.;(. But I disgress... I sit next to this person, Ryan Auspaugh, on the bus. When we talk, it is usually brief and he doesnt have much of a smile. He decided to change seats today and sat next to another person. I saw him talk with glee and smile alot. Maybe, its just because I am a loser. Maybe its because I stink at socialising. Maybe its because I am an asian. Whatever the case, I want a real friend, who cares about me, you know, a best friend. Thats what I dont have that I need. NEEED. I feel like I am in desolate space, while everyone else is in a party club, always socialising and having fun/smiling. It is sureal. Like unnatural. I make jokes, and no-one laughs. I talk and no-one smiles. I just socialize and no-one seems to care about the things we are talking about. It is like I am a totall no-body, like a yes... ill say it again... grain of sand on a beach. I am slowly being grinded into nothingness. NOTHINGNESS. I hate that word. Today, technically was a pretty good day for me at school. Minimum homework and nothing that would cause me to go phycotic. It was a bad day mentaly and morally though. My soul had a pretty hard time accepting alot of things today. I feel that bad karma flowing into me right now, that bad bad karma. Oh yea, that was my orange juice. HAHAHA. You probably arnt laughing are you. Seeeee... I TOLD YOU! No-one cares NO_ONE! why? ARGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I feel tired, the stress is overcoming me... taking me away... taking me away... bye....................:(
