Peace out dudes!,
<br />Anyways, Today was boring. I hate those cutters. I just want to rip them to shreds. Kill them one by one. But thats normal right? Also, the CD ryan gave to me doesn't work. I am so angrilicious. Not at ryan. Angry at the CD. I want to burn it, literaly. Also, today on my agenda of to kill list, were the people who were playing around and not doing anything in comm. Bragging about how they goofed off or played football on the bus. You know who you are. **coughjustinmattadamcough** Ok enough with the coughing. Hey, hey, hey.. E-mail me at averageyo@mostlysunny.com if your reading this. You will get a respond (unless you have a firewall, like ryan) Well, thats about it peoplez. Untill tommorow, this is The Average Yo, over and out;)
