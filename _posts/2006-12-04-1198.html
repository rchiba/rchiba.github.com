Walking through the frigid air to my van, on the sun-splashed black asphalt, I realized what we mean by "Happy Birthday." My door opens with a dull clunk, I start the engine, look out the window and wave to Adam.<br /><br />The message we send is that <span style="font-style: italic;">every day is special.</span> A moment of life should never be taken for granted, and our creation of the "everyday birthday" is a vehicle for this message. We live for only so long. So, take those risky chances, work to your white-knuckle limits, treat others with exceptional care. Simply, live your life like it's your birthday.<br /><br />Happy Birthday.
