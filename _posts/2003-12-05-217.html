Today was kind of depressing because the weekend is going to be very buisy, I have many projects to finish, and the talent show is inching closer and closer. Oh yea, my new nickname in math is "eskim-yo". This is attributed to the fact that I got a nifty new hat.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I decided to call my mom from school to inform her that I had to be picked up at 5:00. She said she would pick me up at 4:30 so I decided to leave early. She said we had to go streight to Downtown because my sister had a choir thing going on. Then she said that it would last an hour. I was angry, but when we went to the bookstore, I calmed down and read something very informative. I was reading a magazine called "Ad-Busters". Now that is MY kind of publishing. Anti-propaganda and philosophical. I URGE you to read it. It is very good and will show you new ways of looking at things. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, it snowed EVEN MORE, but the temperature is rising, so by the time I get up tommorow, the snow will be all gone. Oh yea, I have to go to a band concert tomorow AND go to the County Speech Meet. I have to do good like last time. I am in radio, if you don't know. Anyways, back to the snow. I rolled up a bunch of balls/boulders of snow. I also had a snowball fight against my sister. There wasn't much competition. Just me pummeling my sister with snow and me shrieking maddly in happiness.
<br />
<br />ANyways, it is getting late and the lights around me are off. I better sign off

<br />bye
