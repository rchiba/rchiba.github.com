Hello,
<br />Today, I hurt my finger ,so i cant type as fast. Kyle was in front of me and he stopped. His elbow slammed into my finger and it hurts like heck. I can hardly bend it. I wish, Kyle didn't stop in front of me. Dang my finger hurts, luckily, it is on my left hand. If it was my right, it would have left me crippled. Ohh the suffering, Ohhh the pain. I wish my finger would stop hurting!!!!!!!!!
