I lost my new pen today.<br /><br />Between lunch and fifth period, my pen mysteriously vanished out of my pocket. Upon discovering this, I frantically opened up every one of my many pockets, emptied them all out, and asked the people around me if they had seen a pen. It was to no avail. My pen is now MIA, and I've given up hope on recovering my dear writting buddy. <br /><br />Although a pen may sound insignificant to you, the loss of this crucial writing instrument is not only injuring my productivity, but the loss is also injuring me emotionally. It was going to be my favorite pen, as I spent the whole week before I bought it thinking about buying it. As the last of my old Pilot G-2s began to run out of ink, I fantasized about new pens. <br /><br />And at the store where I bought my new pens, I went in as a man with a mission. Running to the pen section of the store, I examined the large array of pens of every size and shape, fitting for every budget. I see the trusty G-2s, and beside them is a sight to truely behold. The Pilot Precise V5's stared me down, and I stood in awe. They looked godly, and as my mother gave me a twenty dollar bill to buy school supplies with, I decided to splurge and buy six of them, totaling eight dollars. <br /><br />I get home and immediately rush up to my room. I rip the packages open, neatly arrange the pens on my desk, and test them out on a notepad. As I suspected from the awe-inspiring moment at the store, they write beautifully. <br /><br />And, so I go to school and lose one, and it's like losing a new best friend. The emotional toll is staggering. I feel guilty for losing such a great pen, because it was all my fault that I kept it in such a risky place, clipped to my pocket.<br /><br />From this event, I've learned a valuable life lesson.<br /><br />Never become best friends with a pen.
