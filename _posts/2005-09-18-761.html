The sweet, cheerful happiness that is the weekend is yet again yanked from my posession, only to be put back in its cage for five more days. If only its imprisonment was not allowed.<br /><br />But, what is joy and ecstasy if one can experience them constantly? If comfort was constant, that joy of comfort just becomes part of daily existance, and the want for more enjoyment appears. Without pain, suffering, and boredom, there would be no comfort, joy, or excitement. <br /><br />And as I lament the quick disappearance of my dear weekend, I realize that life in itself is a weekend. Except, weekends are constant. Life isn't. So why am I complaining if my weekend flew past my feeble mind? The thing is, I exist, and live, and continue to enjoy my existance. There is no point in complaining about the end of comfort, when being here, breathing and stringing together my thoughts, is such a valuable thing. Life is something to be cherished.<br /><br />And, so I learn. The end of the weekend isn't the end of the Earth. The end of life is. So, learn to love work, or else it really will be the end of the line for you by the time you realize that life is something worth enjoying.<br /><br />So, what did you do today?<br /><br />Well, let's get one thing straight. <br /><br />I don't care.<br /><br />People like to write about events that make up their life. You know why? Because it's easy and takes little thought. People think that by writing what they did, and posting it on some personal site, their life is enriched. Somehow, people try to justify their existance by talking about what they did, instead of why they did it, or what they learned. I know I've already bashed your heads in with this, but as I peruse through my peers' Xangas, I find it repulsive to find that most of those kids are just posting three sentences, summing up the events that took place that day. <br /><br />At other sites, it's even worse. The usual vomit-inducing posts contain quotes, online quiz results, or blurry pictures. Sometimes, there's some idiotic guitar music that plays in the background. Every day, I examine these personal nooks, hoping that their writing skills will improve. Every day, I shudder at the horrible grammar, horrid posts, and idiotic quotes that I don't care to read. I find it completely irrational to post results to nonsensical online quizes on your personal site. My logic is, if one is stupid enough to waste their time trying to figure out "who" one is by taking quizzes made by three year olds, then one shouldn't be allowed near a computer. A person like this shouldn't even be allowed near another human, or even another life form. We, as a society, should lock a person like this in complete isolation, in a small, locked cage, deep beneath the ground. <br /><br />Since I can't come up with a witty one-liner to end my post for today, I have one thing to proclaim.<br /><br />Gah! I hate online quizzes!
