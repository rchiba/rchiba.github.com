My eyes hurt from all the light I've seen this week.<br /><br />The hours that have been severed from my sleeping time are now spent staring into this computer screen or on homework. My room contains eight light sources. Thusly, my room is very bright. All the time I spend in the room I spend looking at brightly lighted objects. <br /><br />I tried to call a number of stores today to see if they had SATA cables. To my misfortune, they were all closed.<br /><br />Russell spent the whole time after school explaining to me how he always got the BEST results Chemistry class, and how it was ALL HIS PARTNER'S fault that he obtained faulty data for his lab. Not to mention how he has the FASTEST flash drive that he got for the CHEAPEST price. Man, can that kid brag. I absolutely hated it. I wanted to pull out a bat and whack him to a bloody pulp. I mean, I can understand calling your partner distracted, but to go out of your way to tell everyone that you "always obtain the best results" is a bit too arrogant. <br /><br />Oddly enough, when a superior comes in, he suddenly becomes "Mr. Nice", and becomes a humble, generous, and modest student. He always asks questions and uses as much jargon as he can to impress the superior. Personally, his tactics to gain social turf infuriate me, but I guess I'm giving him a hard time. I have to understand that there will always be people who push down their subordinates to boost their own ego, and will lie about "who" they really are to reach to the top. I guess I should be thanking Russell for helping me realize that the world is a mean, cutthroat place.<br /><br />But, something positive he did today, he complemented my Blender hotkey usage. That made me smile a little.
