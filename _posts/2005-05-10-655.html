I've updated my picture page so I'll probably post some pictures directly to this blog in a few minutes. Anyways, I've been doing more doodles. This is helping orient me to drawing on a PDA screen. It's working, I think. I've done my first attempt at shading, which is rather mediocre, but it makes it look better.<br /><br />Anyways, we have to watch a movie in OLC about a latino singer named "Sabrina" and I still see no relationship between this latino singer and Orientation to Life and Careers.<br /><br />Josh has invited me to yet another escapade in town. I'm trying to negotiate that and studying for my finals. I don't know how I'll be able to do it.<br /><br />Oh yea, in other news, people think that anthropomorphic drawings (Personified animals, or 'furries') are weird/dorky so everyone thinks that I'm weird/dorky. I can't handle drawing human beings since they are so... well, filthy. Filthy humans! Well, I've always had an attraction to anthropomorphic drawings and whatnot ever since I laid my eyes on Starfox cartoons and Pokemon. Well, my attraction to 'furries' probably originated in my mind much earlier. Perhaps my stuffed bear had something to do with it. I don't know, anthropomorphic drawings are just... So much more fantastical. Something that can't compare with elves and knomes of the ancient. Something that compare with aliens and robots of the future. It's something much better. Yet, people always stray away from this kind of stuff. That's popular culture negatively influencing the minds and opinions of children for you.
