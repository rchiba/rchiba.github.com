Tomorrow is going to be the last diving practice. What in the heck (of what the h*ll, if you're one of those "commoners" who can't refrain themselves from swearing in public areas, mainly the cafeteria), just end already! When diving ends, I'm going to be so relieved. I mean, It's like getting used to sleeping on a bed of coals, and then getting to sleep in a tempur-pedic foam bed. I am quite excited.<br /><br />Anyways, I got one of those "Computer Fun" sheets. Basically, we took a test earlier in the year and a computer matched me up to 10 opposite sexxed people. The results came out something like this:<br /><br />1. Krista Howe<br />2. Julia Branstrator<br />3. Samantha Yoder<br />4. Whitney Ketterer<br />5. Abigail Heath<br />6. Ashley Gibson<br />7. Susan Mullen<br />8. Britny Kelly<br />9. Berenice Lopez<br />10. Rachel Cheeseman<br /><br />Obviously, you probably don't even care about my computer matched love list, so ignore it. I mean, I'm somewhat anti-social when it comes to "parties" and such.<br /><br />I've always thought of parties as being to chaotic. My social life has to be structured and methodically prepared before execution. I need a schedule to follow. I need set guidelines. Perhaps this is why not every girl out there would like to be near me. I mean, all of those popular kids seem to like chaos and disorder. It's like they live in a third world country. How uncultured.<br /><br />But, I think to myself, what about Devin? He's one of the most cultured and sophisticated (Not to mention popular) people I know. I'm not joking. Behind his pale, thieving, bony face, he has a deeper look on important issues. Devin is just one of those people who don't fit to my stereotype of popular people, so I'll just forget about him. Stereotyping popular people makes me feel better.<br /><br />I want tomorrow to end now. Please... I'm going to cry...
