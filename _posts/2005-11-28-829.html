The sleep and food thing have really been working against me from the beginning.<br /><br />From how I see the world, sleep and food are really just redundant obstacles in life, something that must be done, but accomplishes nothing. I didn't eat lunch today, and only got 6-7 hours of sleep last night. This did not bode well for me today. My head was dizzy the whole school day, and I couldn't focus, not that I could anyways. Yawning was a problem, and I really wanted to collapse in the hallway and just sleep. But, to tell you the truth, if there was one thing that would be my dream, it would be to become a robot. Having no sleep or no food means no worries! Mechanical failure could easily be repaired, and parts would be replacable. Data integration and electronic collaboration would greatly increase productivity. No more clunky plastic keyboards and mouses for our primitive human hands. It would be just plug, install necessary drivers, and manipulate data without the restrictions of a physical entity to move. Energy wouldn't be a matter of buying food, but plugging one's self into the grid to "eat" the electricity from burning petrol.<br /><br />Who knows, perhaps I will get my wish someday. <br /><br />Or maybe not.
