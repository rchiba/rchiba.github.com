It's about 9:30 pm and I have finally finished backing up my writings to a floppy disk. 276 pages of emotion over 1.5 years... Geez, I write alot.<br /><br />Anyways, today started out roughly when I took a French test that just creamed me. I couldn't even answer the last 2 questions, even though I studied adequately. This incident destroyed my self-esteem by force. I was on the edge, the edge where you're about to explode in rage and start weeping at the same time. It didn't help that the French teacher asked me in french, "Who is a cute girl in this school?" in French. I tried to look out of the window, and perhaps she would think that I was to absentminded to answer such a question. My hands started to sweat. I cringed and hoped that she wouldn't call on me.<br /><br />She did. And just then, I was jolted into red-alert mode. With cognitave sirens blaring in my head, I tried to think of ways to stall for time. <br /><br />"Uhhh... Ummm..."-me<br />"Is it the 'dans le ecole' part that is messing you up?"-teacher<br />"Ummm... No, I understand the question, but..."-me<br />"What?"-teacher<br />"It's a bit of a personal question"-me<br />Just then, the capillaries in my cheeks exploded, making my face red and my body temperature rise steadily.<br /><br />She then replied that she "never thought of it like that..." and promptly asked another person another question.<br /><br />What do you mean you've never thought of it like that!?! I think it's a tad bit personal, kinda, since, I'm the anti-socialite. The whole chain of incidents just crushed my self-esteem. Just mashed it into a ball of hate and embarassment. A melting ball, perhaps.<br /><br /><br />Another event worth noting... <br />The social studies class was not a happy class for me today (It rarely is, I mean, it's so boring. No, really. The class is just PURE worksheet activities and outdated movies!) because Zach went past the line. <br /><br />We (the class) was talking about how Internet (Capital 'I', duh) has changed the world (my teacher isn't very intelligent so the discussion was quite offensive to me). Then, we started talking about the downsides of the Internet. When picture sharing was brought up, I grinned at Zach, to signal to him that we both had some experience with this subject and that we are more advanced than the teacher. Unfortunately, this signal somehow provoked him into bursting into how "Cheebs" (me) should be sued because I took pitures of him (That never even were worth keeping because they were always blurry.)I hate being called "Cheebs". I find it very disrespectful when people do so. I have told Zach NUMEROUS times to stop calling me by that name, but he's just a disrespectful nut. The most offensive thing about the whole incident was that Zach was threatening to sue me for taking pictures of him that I promptly deleted and weren't even worth the server space to put on the Internet. How dare he... If he can't call me by my name, then he shouldn't even call me by any name. I shouldn't even respond to his idiotic nonsense, but yet, I do. I do because this "aquaintanceship" might be important for future social conflicts. I will keep being friendly to Zach, however much this angers me so.<br /><br />Today was the LAST "official" diving practice, HOOAH!<br /><br />And, that's about it. Alpaca Shack Dreams baby!
