The mind would rather wander elsewhere. But, same thoughts. No one wants to read the same thing over again. Especially when it's needlessly emotional or dramatic<span style="font-style: italic;">:</span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> "I'm stupid... blah, blah, blah... I can't finish my homework... blah, blah, blah... I have no future... blah, blah, blah"</span></span><br /><br />I read somewhere that you could transform your mindset by doing a few mental chores every day. One of these chores is to name three things that made today worth living.<br /><br />Maybe this'll work (or not...)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Today was worth living today because:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">1. Scouting at the robotics meeting went smoothly. Although Logan and related drive-team members have not expressed appreciation of our efforts, I believe that this has been the best attempt at comprehensive robot-scouting yet. The scouting sheets even feature pictures.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">2. I played Jenga, and felt like a somebody for an hour or two.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">3. I was finally able to use the green hair paint I bought a few days ago. How often does one have a chance to dye their hair green?</span><br /><br />So there's my pathetic attempt at being optimistic. I remember participating in the Optimist Club Speech Contest. I even won a trophy. Where are the old days?
