I"m so de-energized. Three days of pure extracurricular work. I'm not used to this work load. Diving... Quizbowl... At least I have something to write on my resume in the future.
<br />
<br />Talking about resumes, I still think the "Orientation to Life and Careers" is one of the most wasted periods of my lifespan. I entered a un-biased student on the first day. I came in, sat down, and listened to what she said. Everyone has been telling me that this class was a load of ... Anyways, I was here to see if it was true. To see of "Orientation to Life and Careers" was really as crappy as everyone has been making it out to be. She explained the rules like all the other classes, on the first day. 
<br />
<br />Second day... The teacher explains that we will be doing an activity that consists of interviewing another person and then presenting our interview to the rest of the class. This interview consisted of questions already written on a piece of paper that she handed each of us. These questions included, "How many pillows do you sleep with?" and "What is your favorite ice cream flavor?".
<br />
<br />Ok, I say to myself... This seems absurd, but I can deal with it. Just one of those ridiculous activities that the teacher uses up at the beginning. I told myself that there would be better things to do in the future for this class. 
<br />
<br />Thurd day... We present. It seems absurd, but I presented well in front of my peers. I still don't understand why we had to tell everyone about the pillows we sleep with, but I decided to keep my optimistic outlook on the future of this class.
<br />
<br />Fourth day... The class is still presenting. I am beginning to realize that this activity is pointless and irrelevant. I don't care about how many pillows some reject in the corner sleeps with. I struggle to retain my optimistic outlook.
<br />
<br />Fifth day...The class is STILL presenting. I'm starting to get riled up now. I'm not violent, but my optimistic sense of reality has turned into a Cold War-esque arms race, on the brink of war. I am about to explode because I realize some thing that everyone has been telling me. This class is a TRUE waste of my life. Luckily, the idiotic pillow questions stop and the presentations are over. I win back some of my optimistic outlook on this class, since we were going to the library on the next day to do another "activity".
<br />
<br />Sixth and Seventh days... I have realized that "activity" is really a word that is synonymous with "Idiotic and time-consuming worksheet over something that is either unimportant or obvious". We have to do various worksheets that teach us how use search engines. I start to feel like a genius in an asylum. I start to go mad, but being on the computer calms me, even if I'm stuck in a hellhole doing some worksheet about something I learned in 3rd grade.
<br />
<br />Eighth day... We spend the hour watching a video on Accountants, Chefs, and another occupation that I don't care to remember. We are forced to do a worksheet on one of these jobs. Unfortunately, these jobs don't interest me. I start to wonder of the teacher knows how to tie her shoes.
<br />
<br />Ninth day... The class spends the whole class period doing an irrelevant test to see if we are "audio", "visual", or "tactile" learners. I find this activity frustrating because I feel like I already know who I am. I don't have to take a test to see if I learn better with pictures of audio. I already know how to study. I already know my strengths and weaknesses. I ALREADY KNOW MYSELF! It's like their handing me a worksheet that will test if I am male or female. I ALREADY know the answer! 
<br />
<br />Today was the ninth day. I have learned the truth. "Orientation to Life and Careers" simply sucks. Everyday will be torture, a living hell. The idiotic teacher will make us do pointless worksheets that don't pertain to me.
<br />
<br />The oh so very unfortunate thing is, is that EVERYONE is REQUIRED to take this class.
