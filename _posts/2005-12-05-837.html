I suppose it's a matter of me having a problem with my ego or something.<br /><br />And it's odd because I've never really learned what "ego" means. It's just something that one can infer from how people use it, talk about it, and interpret it. Ego always seemed to be such an odd word for me. It looks a lot like "egg", and "lego", but it doesn't quite mean the same thing.<br /><br />Let's see... Ego can mean:<br /><br />1. self: your consciousness of your own identity<br /><br />2. Elektrik Gaz Otobüs İşletmesi , which is the bus and metro operator of Ankara.<br /><br />or,<br /><br />3. A four-piece rock band from Lisburn, Northern Ireland<br /><br />I think I'm using ego in the first context, as in how I percieve myself, and how I see others see me. <br /><br />It's a sham, my whole life. <br /><br />Actually, maybe, not my whole life. But, it was a sham this afternoon.<br /><br />Wallowing in self-pity/disgust, the only topic of conversation I could come up with was how I failed today's chemistry test.<br /><br />And it was stupid. I just kept going up to people to talk about how I failed, and who knows why.<br /><br />Actually, I know why. I did it because I'm a stupid, egotistical jerk that wants to let everyone know I failed because my idiotic mind can't comprehend how I, in all my amazingness, failed a test. And yes, I'm embarrassed now that I think about it, because there's no point in being a sore, obnoxious loser. Just because all of my peers were able to finish a test and I didn't doesn't mean that I can just go on a giant rant and annoy people with my foolishness. It's just so, illogical, how I acted.<br /><br />But, I did. And that's just how it's going to be. Because one cannot change what has already past. It's behind me. I suppose I'll just make a new initiative to stop complaining so blatantly to other people because I know that I'm going to fail tests in the future, and it doesn't really even matter, because a test is a test. <br /><br />Pass or fail, everyone gets a fair grade.<br /><br />I deserved to fail.
