Zach told me to post an "ethical" question. I find it more divided. 
<br />
<br />"If you had a choice, would you choose to be immortal or mortal?"
<br />
<br />Obviously, the choice is to be immortal. Everybody thinks it would be so terribly bad to be immortal though. I don't understand. Perhaps everyone likes to say that they wouldn't want to be immortal to justify their mortal existance. Why would you NOT want to be immortal? They say that you would get bored. If a complete idiot was immortal, they would get bored, but you could learn everything in the world, and then some. You could interact with people for... well, forever. If there weren't people, you could travel to different parts of the universe without the fear of death. Without the fear of age. You could humor yourself and others. You could teach, learn, or you could do absolutely nothing. You do absolutely nothing when you are dead. You feel no emotions, you are non-existant. People say that their "souls" become "free" and "relaxed" when they die. I'm pretty sure that this is just a way to cope with the obvious knowledge that humans die, eventually. You feel no emotions and have nothing when you die. Therefore, you can't "relax" or be "free". You don't exist. It's not a hard concept to grasp. And if you do say that you are going to "heaven", then you are just promoting suicidal people to kill themselves. They kill themselves to relieve themselves from the pains of life. Unfortunately, you can't feel relief when you're decomposing 6 feet under ground. Yea, you can say that suicide is a "sin" and they are going to go to "hell", but that is just a cop out of another flaw in the religion system. I know people are going to come up to me and "Jesus" the crap out of me now... Great...
<br />
<br />Anyways, everything is happy in my world. I can be happy while knowing that I will die. That amazing optimist club is one of the only things that really mattered in life. It might even qualify for a position higher than my "bike-riding" skills.
<br />
<br />By the way, I want the "orientation to life and careers" class to not exist. We have to do a "portfolio" thing, and the problem is that the teacher isn't exactly the most suited for the class. She's an art teacher, and she hasn't "oriented" me toward my "life and career" yet. We've spent the first week doing completely irrelevant "introduction" activities. In these RETARDED STUPID ILLOGICAL "ITS DRIVING ME INSANEO" activities, we have to introduce someone to the whole class. My only question: "Why are we introducing someone when the whole class knows all about them anyways?" My life is being wasted by these IDIOTIC activities. I can't really express my angered sentiment toward these activities very... articulately. 
<br />
<br />Good night.
