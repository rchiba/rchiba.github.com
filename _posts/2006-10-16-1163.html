I've opened and closed this program a few times now, trying to convince myself that there isn't anything to type. That today was a day worth forgetting, that there was nothing of note in these past 20-some hours.<br /><br />And to tell you the truth, I can't think of anything that made me <i>feel</i>. I was entirely content. <br /><br />Although, I snapped this afternoon and started to type grouchy and frustrating words to my friends. That was right before I ate dinner, and I was <i>hungry</i>. After eating, I stopped typing angry things and got to work on my various affairs. Go figure.<br /><br />When I'm about to die, I'll look back to days like this and feel stupid and remorseful for taking this grand life for granted.
