My days are numbered (view top of screen), but is that really worth working as hard as I am? I come home at 7p.m. if I'm lucky, and I might have 30 minutes of spare time if I'm luckier. Usually I have to stay up just to do my homework or study for a test. It is very frustrating to me. I cannot smile, and any joy at all only lasts for a few seconds, then it melts away into anger, shame, sadness, depression, absentmindedness... etc. I can't concentrate, I can't comprehend, I have problems processing large batches of information, I am slower at math, I can't eat, and I can't be happy. What is happy anyways? Who needs happy when you're hopelessly overworked and despise your existance?
<br />
<br />Math class frustrated me today because all of the younger children worked faster and more efficiently than I ever will. I did math at half their speed. I hate myself sometimes. Everyone seems to be better than me at everything. Reading, math, trivia, reflexes, and even playing the clarinet. I can't play my clarinet as good as anyone else. I'm frustrating myself and blaming everyone else for it, and I know, but it's my way of coping with my stress, and as Rachel Cheezedawg always says, "Don't rain on my parade, mister!"
<br />
<br />I can't be happy. What is happy?
