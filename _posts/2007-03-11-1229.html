It all really comes down a simple question: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Why am I here?"</span><br /><br />In about 48 hours, I have to hand over a list of classes I'm interested in taking at Purdue. The counselors gave us a website to go to. The website has a list of every class available to all Purdue students. The website's list is incredibly overwhelming for me. Just the large number of career paths.<br /><br />The website's list is a reminder of my failure.<br /><br />I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life.<br /><br />I've said it a million times, but it doesn't solve my problem. I can talk to it with all my friends and it won't solve my problem. I can write about it on this blog. I can keep myself awake thinking about it. Nothing is there to solve my problem but <span style="font-style: italic;">myself.</span><br /><br />To imagine, some <span style="font-style: italic;">stupid person</span> who has trouble making a choice like this. <span style="font-style: italic;">I'm that stupid person.</span> The answer should be obvious. I should be who I want to be. Work for something I believe in. After all, something I'll be doing for the rest of my life should be something I'm interested in and passionate about.<br /><br />But, I have no passion. Or interest. Or any sort of belief. I read stories of scientists, researchers, actors, sports stars, artists, and programmers. The stories describe how young Dr. Doe was passionate about health after his mother and father died from an unknown disease. Or a mathematician that has been solving Rubik's cubes since he was five. I'm not one of those special people who have a passion or heroic incentive. <span style="font-style: italic;">I don't care if cancer kills us all.</span> I don't care if we're <span style="font-style: italic;">stuck in the Digital Age for the next thousand years. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm a nobody,</span> an insignificant member of a huge ecosystem. Why should I care? If I died tomorrow, nobody would care. Caring is for the people in the stories. They can save the world. I can't. I won't.<br /><br />I'm not talented. I have no particular amazing skill. I'm not good at math. Not good at memorizing lists. Not good at reading. Not good at music. Not good at throwing javelins. So, is it now when I accept that my future will be one of obscure worthlessness? Of pointless stupor, a valueless, dark void?<br /><br />As time passes by, the choice is getting harder. What do I want to do with the rest of my life? I want to be successful, but I don't believe in myself. Fourty Seven hours, and hope's still hard to find. It's horrible that it's me who has the littlest. I feel terrible.
