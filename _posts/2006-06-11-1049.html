This weekend has been a sorry one. I'm glad it's over. Good riddance. Rainy, cold, sad, bleak, etc. <br /><br />Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, I have spent these days falling apart, falling down. The excitement and social activity of the weekdays will pull me together. <br /><br />My wrist is starting to ache. And I'm sort of worried, because so many things I do involve my hands, and more importantly, my wrists. Drawing, modelling, animating, typing, doing homework, and failing tests. Without functional wrists, I would be stuck in a very deep hole. I'm grateful to have useful, working wrists. So recently, I've been taking a little time every few minutes to strech my wrists. <br /><br />There are so many things I'm grateful for, but I guess I'm not grateful enough, but it would be impossible to express gratefulness for all of the things that I have. There are just so many things.<br /><br />I guess I'll end here so I can sleep. <br /><br />
