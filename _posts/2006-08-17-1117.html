Today was the fated day of make-up work.<br /><br />I wasn't given too much work, but here I am, the clock is ticking closer to my sleep deadline. I've still got a few pages of things to do. I'm so slow at doing work because I'm just not fast in doing anything.<br /><br />I'm not fast at math, I'm not fast at housework, I'm not fast at reading, I'm not even fast at driving. I've gone through this charade before, and I've explained many times why it's so frustrating to always be in last place, but I can't let myself become concerned with those things anymore. I'm slow at writing too. It takes me thirty minutes to type out a medium-sized email. This poorly-written, small post will end up taking up half an hour to type as well. I just keep typing, keep deleting. Nothing is ever good enough. And it doesn't matter in the end, because nothing good ever comes out of my writing. I'm beginning to <i>heavily</i> regret joining the newspaper team at school. I have no idea why the journalism teacher thinks I'm a good writer. I hate it. I hate being thought of as someone who I'm not. I'm sick of it.<br /><br />I felt sick all day.<br /><br />The weekend is going to come, and everything will be better. That's it. I'll just wait for the weekend to come and rescue me. If it doesn't, I don't know what I'll do. <br /><br />It's my eleventh year of school and I'm still so confused. <br /><br />The programming teacher was talking about how Japanese students are conditioned to perform at a higher standard. When she said that, Devin said something about me and how I prove stereotypes right, or something like that.<br /><br />I just wanted to strangle everybody and tell them that I'm <i>not any fucking better at math than anyone else</i>. I just wanted to do all these horrible things to myself and the people around me. My anger, this passionate emotion that I thought was gone. What was I thinking, it's never gone. But, I just want to forget about it now. It'll all go away eventually.<br /><br />There are so many great things in my life to balance these negative points out. I'm very grateful for knowing all of the people I know. I just prefer writing about the bad things, so they'll end up on here and not in my head.
