In speech class today, the introductory information for the next speech, an impromptu speech, was shoved in our faces. <br /><br />To come up with information, we were asked to write five general topics, five current events, and a witty quotation.<br /><br />And it got me thinking all day.<br /><br />But, in all actuality, half of my school day was spent in either a vegetative state, or in a raving mad state. I half-remember health class. Right now, it seems like a dream. The class is full of rejects anyways. Sleeping helps me blend in with the crowd. The teacher passed out random papers and ranted on about "stress" and a bunch of other information that we learned in preschool. The usual.<br /><br />Currently, I'm in a love-hate relationship with health class. I hate it with a passion, as I sit between two mentally handicapped lads and a bunch of 2-year algebra flunkers. <br /><br />I understand that I'm supposed to be sensitive when it comes to mentally handicapped people, but I can't lie. They drive me nuts. Their state of mind is coherent enough to fluently converse with other humans, but they both have control issues. One lad has an issue with anger, which he controls though religion. I heard him today in class about how he had to "repent for his sins". I found it facinating that religion is omnipotent in society, no matter what state of mind one is in. When people do not listen to him, he gets loud and starts to yell. The fact that his voicebox is constantly within three feet of my ears bothers me in these times of crisis. <br /><br />The other lad also has a problem controlling his voice. During the beginning of the period, announcements are played from the television in the classroom. Because the general population of the class is of a lower intelligence, talking usually covers up the voices coming from the television. When this happens, the lad I mentioned earlier begins to scream. The fact that his voicebox is constantly within two feet of my ears bothers me. Not to mention the fact that he does this every day. He also obsessively loves sports. This irritates me so very much.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm being an insensitive bastard by complaining about how these handicapped people bother me, and I understand that they cannot physically control themselves due to their modified anatomy, but sometimes, I want to pull out a gun or a bat and whack them senseless to a fucking bloody pulp. <br /><br />So, I suppose the last sentence accurately sums up how I usually feel like in health class. But, today, I mostly slept. So this is where the "love" part of the "love-hate" relationship comes in. I love the fact that the teacher has been desensitized to all negative behavior that she tolerates it. I sleep, and she doesn't even notice. So, I can get my daily 40 minutes of sleep every day. Definitely a positive aspect to an otherwise negative class.<br /><br />Then comes English class, where the teacher is a bastard social reformist.<br /><br />She attempted to force-feed her viewpoint on the words "poignant" and "pungent" today. According to her, "poignant" has nothing to do with taste or smell. Because of this "definitive information", she decided to count off points on our vocabulary exam if we mentioned taste or smell in a question involving using "poignant" in a sentence. <br /><br />I completely disagree with her teachings, as taste and smell are distinctly mentioned in our vocabulary book and Merriam-Webster's CollegiateÂ® Dictionary Eleventh Edition. <br /><br />The real question to ask in this situation is, "Should I trust Merriam-Webster, or infuriating English teacher?"<br /><br />The answer to this question is clear, but how she handled disagreements was what riled me up the most.<br /><br />A student politely walked up to her, after she stated that "If anyone has any questions, don't be afraid to come up to me." The student showed her the textbook definitions, as well as his exam, trying to explain that the textbook mentions taste and smell. The teacher bluntly told the student that he was wrong, and that his sentence was unacceptable. The student tried to explain again, but the teacher firmly stood her ground and finally asked, "Is it clear to you now?" Finally understanding that he was a subordinate, the student nodded and sat back down.<br /><br />This kind of bullshit in our education system absolutely disgusts me. <br /><br />What kind of teacher doesn't accept a mistake in their logic, even after textbook evidence is shown? What kind of asshole teacher can't even comprehend the fact that they can be wrong too? What kind of motherfucking, bastard teacher won't listen to the voice of reason? <br /><br />Unfortunately, the answer to those questions is all too obvious for me.<br /><br />My English teacher.<br /><br />When she said, "If anyone has any questions, don't be afraid to come up to me.", she really meant, "I am always right. You are always wrong. My judgement is non-negotiable."
