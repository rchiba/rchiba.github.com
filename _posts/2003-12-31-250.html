I just ate breakfast and remembered that I forgot to update this site yesterday. Both school and a new year a aproaching like a freight train. Another year poofs from my life, and yours, and everybody elses... That is unless you are an eternally living organism, are you? I saw "Bowling for Columbine" it was good, but I already knew all that stuff about America killing Americans since I was like 10 years old. Everyone else is surprised with it because they never knew about media frenzies. All the unassuming people at school always trusted the media, now that's pretty sad. Trusting the media is sad. They never knew the media picked out stories that had african americans in it. All the people around me are oblivious to the nature of media and their syndicate overridden hulls. Ahhhh, the incompetence of people around me always makes me feel better. I think I am safe to say this because the people who come to my site have drastically reduced. Consequently, I have a less chance of certain choice people seeing this.

<br />Hey, did you notice that I never use full bad words on here? I think that is amazing considering that everyone around this corn infested farmland uses offensive words all the time. Certain (Stupid and incompetent I might add) say offensive words like this in front of teachers. There's this school in the city near where I live called "Klondike". Their only conversation starters are, Well, maybe I shouldn't tell you because it is way too offensive. I mean, with the publicity outbreak and all, teachers could see this. I have to censor myself. Isn't that ironic? I'm on the INTERNET and I have to censor myself. I hate it when people bother me about my site, makes me feel like crushing them. If they are offended, DONT GO TO IT! If you want to know where it is, USE A SEARCH ENGINE! If you want to learn how to make a site, USE AN ONLINE TUTORIAL! Simple as that folks, now shut up and let me be.
<br />
<br />Anyways, today I am going to Indianapolis (People around here call it "Indie" I have no idea why) to celebrate new years. I have to remember to practice my speech about my grandma. I gotta gotta practice. I can't believe this site is this old. I want to keep this site untill blogger goes down, I really hope blogger doesn't go down. It has a good probablility that it will survive though. It was purchased by google, and google is HUGE. But internet companies crash so fast. One day you see it, then it says, "This page cannot be found..."or"error 401".

<br />I have to practice for mathcounts, but I can't practice because I don't understand anything. I can't even remember what factors are(Shishir, my friend, told me what they were, but stupid me forgot)!
<br />
<br />Well, I feel rejuvenated that I wrote such a long post and now, I guess I am redeemed for one more day of doing nothing at all. Without school, life is a bore. With school, life is a chore. I would choose school.
