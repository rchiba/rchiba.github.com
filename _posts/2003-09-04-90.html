Today I rejoice, for It is I, the YO Miesta, who has no homework, at all.
<br />REJOICE!
<br />Anyways, my finger is still hurting very badly. I really really hope it gets better. It kind of handicaps my typing. On school news today, I have been impounded by the populars in this community because I have turned one of them in. I told one of my teachers that Justin Revord wanted our band teacher dead. It wasn't MY fault I tell you!!!
<br />But, the populars like ***cough***alexi***cough*** just don't understand. She also wasted time once again in social studis. I cant believe how unproductive she is. Today we discussed the life structure in days when cavemen ruled. The men hunted and the women did other stuff. She got all sexist and protective. I think that we wasted tons of time today because of Alexia and that makes me very angry, that is my feeling right now. I wonder what I'll do today with all my precious extra time. I dont know. Maybe I shall slay a cow or go into outer space. WHhhhhhhheeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!
