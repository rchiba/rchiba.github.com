Hey, it's me Justin. Yeah, you probably can't even remember me.  Anyways, I have to be the worst blog updater ever.  I feel really bad and guilty.  I'm sorry Ryo, Amanda.  Well, today was the last day of school. YAAAAA!!!  Well sort of ya.  Now I won't see any of my friends anymore.  Also, I've just witness the newly featured Banana Man 1 & 2 movies.  I have to say, they aren't the best I've seen but it is rather good.  I really liked it Ryo, tell Devin too.  I just got great news.  I get to go to Kings Island this year!  I was originally on the waiting list.  There's only one problem...I have to go on the Klondike bus.  But I will be with my friends Cameron Wilson and Spencer Martin.  It'll be very weird though.  I'm kinda nervous.  Well thats really all I've got on my mind at the moment.  I'll be sure to post again soon.  seeya.
