I'm frustrated over how to get my posts back up to where they are supposed to be. I've tried erasing the sidebar completely, but a lot is on there, you know? I mean, most of you don't even care about my silly links, but I use them sometimes when I'm bored and have forgotten where I've been to in the past. Grr... Maybe it's time to find a new template. <br /><br />In the mean time, I'll be drawing David Hopkins style, or at least try to. It's great to learn from his style since he uses much more emotion than shallow, gag comics like Plugged Nickel. Lots of anger and angst in his characters. Hmm... Maybe someday I'll be like him, I wish. A lonely nerd who spends his California days and nights toiling over webcomics and furry conventions. What a role model, eh?<br /><br />You know what? TIME magazine said that 15% of African Americans surveyed believed that AIDS was created to harass blacks. African Americans account for about half of all AIDS diseased people, but only account for 34% of the total population. Half of all African Americans think that the cure for AIDS is being hidden from the poor by the rich. How absurd is this!? If these findings are anything, they are portraying a bad image for African Americans! 15% of African Americans believe that COMPLETE nonsense? If these statistics are accurate, then this African American community must be like some kind of retard cult, in which African Americans are sucked in and led to believe stupid, impossible to comprehend logically, stupid, stupid, stupid things. Oh, woe is me.
