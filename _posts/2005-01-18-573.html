I'm terribly exitable right now.
<br />
<br />I called Devin earlier and I was really spontaneous. I predict that he will think of me as a drug addict now because he probably isn't used to me being so spontaneous. I started making up stories as I was talking to him to try to improve my spontaneous creativity skills. He became very confused. Maybe this will conflict with him. I don't know the possible outcomes, but I hope good will turn out from my new spontaneous, optimistic outlook. 
<br />
<br />It's late and I'm studying and I'm listening to Arockalypse and the Amazing TransMetropolitans and my life is like a swirling torrent of information brewing in my head. I feel empowered by my knowledge...
<br />
<br />Anyways, think about how many ways being spontaneous would come in handy. Being creative like this could result in new ways of thinking of solutions to problems. Creative problem solving comes in handy in many jobs. As long as speaking more creativity, my Taco Bell Fiesta Bowl and Mountain Dew has caused an increase in my speed of typing. I'm going at least 80 words per minute, and I know it because I'm just whizzing through this post.
<br />
<br />I'm feeling spontaneous and empowered. I'm not on drugs. Actually I did have a bit of caffine in the Mountain Dew, so I do take a very common and potent drug, caffine. It's deffinitely working on me right now. I don't feel tired at all. I feel like a crazy lemon bouncing off of fuzzy green walls. Don't ask me where that came from, because I'm still working on my spontaneous creativity skills. I need to get off of this caffine high and go back to my dull state of normality. 
<br />
<br />I suppose this caffine high is what most Americans experience for most of their lives. I feel so sick when I think of being this excited constantly. How could your circulatory/nervous system handle it? It's like shoving plutonium down your throat and going insane...
<br />
<br />Good study night to everyone!
