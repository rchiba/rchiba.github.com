The snapfish ordered pictures are in, and the verdict is...
<br />
<br />I HATE THE CVS PHARMACY PHOTO DEPARTMENT FOR RIPPING ME OFF FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS! Online ordered pictures are faster, cheaper, and are of better quality than ANY retailer out there. Therefore, the CVS Pharmacy Photo Deparment has been placed in a special place in my heart. The "I hate you forever no matter what you do to try to win back my patronage" section.
<br />
<br />Anyways, a tip to anyone who has any (absolutely any any any) motive to go to one of these con CVS Photo places... well... Those who go there should be inspired by the likes of me to use snapfish or any other online-photo printing shop.
<br />
<br />Yea, I hate CVS now. Got it?
