For most of the day now, I've been vegetating in front of the Internet, and drawing. My life has sped up drastically. I occupy myself now. I don't play silly games, I create worlds. I am almighty God, with my name capitalized even though I'm not a proper noun so it confuses a lot of people!<br /><br />Ok, maybe not that far, but I'm delusional right now from sleep deprivation. I'm not in good shape to write so I'm just going to say that they don't sell thin pants anymore because everyone is obese. That is all. I is t3h tired. Meh.
