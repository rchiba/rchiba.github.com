This is a short expository video on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_cafe" target="_blank">maid cafe's</a> in Japan made by CNN.

It's fun to watch because Joe, the man in the video, is convinced that these maid cafe's are about female submission and sexuality, when they are not. I'm not a Japanophile or anything, and I think that most people would mirror Joe's reaction to maid cafe's, but at the same time, I think that it's a little disappointing that CNN's people are closed-minded like the rest of us.
