4 years ago I wrote a [2018 Financial Year in Review](/2018/12/27/2018-financial-year-in-review.html) that documented my spending habits. And 4 years before then, I wrote a [2014 Financial Year in Review](/2015/01/04/financial-snapshot.html). How time flies and how life changes. From a spending perspective, the biggest change with this review is that I am now married, which means that these spending patterns are now for 2 people, not just me. 

With that said, how does 2022 stack up in terms of spend?
