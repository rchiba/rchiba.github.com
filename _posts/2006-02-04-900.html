My instrument never did grow on me.<br /><br />The magic of creating noise from a vibrating reed strapped to a narrow wooden tube only lasted a few months for me. Starting seventh grade, I began to neglect my clarinet practice. By eigth, I didn't take my clarinet home at all. The magic wore off, like a lost hope. I had first chair for a bit, then second, and then third. My grip on musical superiority slipped, and I've never regained the friction needed to sustain my interest in such things.<br /><br />So today, at this "Solo & Ensemble" dealie that's at my school, everything went as planned, the thing our band has rehearsed for for the past few months, the very thing that has probably consumed more of my life than reading A Tale of Two Cities, was practically worthless. The time, flittered into the darkest reaches of nothingness. Because, the performance was over in a matter of minutes, we got the rating that the judges always give, gold. The whole practicing for months for the performance was a bunch of nonsense. The judges give out gold medals to any team that doesn't look like terrorists.<br /><br />Great, now I said terrorists. I might as well say "bomb". Now the NSA is going to flag this site and I'm going to be taken away to Gitmo. Just my cup of tea, I'm telling ya'. Good thing I have no problems with religious scriptures being flushed down toilets. That's one thing that I can safely say that I will not get upset about in such a place.<br /><br />And so, my clarinet playing is done for. Next year, I'm not taking band, and I say, "Good riddance!" Because I will never again enjoy making music, and I will never take pleasure in extracting a beat from random-ish patterns of dots on paper. The way I see it, the world should exterminate all high school bands in existance and turn them into synthesizer and guitar classes. People see classical music as well, "classy". But, what is class but an illusion set up by society, and our culture. In three hundred years from now, country music could be "classy", or techno could be "classy". Music is just a pattern of waves that the brain puts back together and interprets. And, I'm sure that many people listen to classical music only because it's "classy". Just like people who carry big books around and pretend to read them, just to seem smart. Or people who just buy the books and put them on their shelves as "decoration".<br /><br />Personally, I don't think classical music is all that "classy". It's all so primitive. Mallets, hammers, strings, human lung exhaust, reeds. They're all ages old. And yet people treasure them so. For what reason? It could be the fact that we are born and raised to see this kind of music to be very rich. The romantic-seeming, or expensive setting scenes in movies and television always have the signature jazz or classical music. In an ideal world, pianos come with men in tuxedos. But, the ideal world is what we tell ourselves, the stereotypes we create, the generalizations that are broadcast to every corner, every crevice, and every nook of society.<br /><br />Maybe I should give up music again. The whole subject just makes me just a bit confused, angry, and tired. Plus, I heard that music slows down reading, and I seriously have to get through my English literature book reading assignment this weekend.
