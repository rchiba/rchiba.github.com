I watched clippings of <i>A Goofy Movie</i> this evening as I was brushing my teeth. I remember crying the first time I saw it. It was a heart-wrenching movie at the time of my viewing. It came out in 1995, and I remember it being new-ish when I saw it. Now, I have this odd sort of connection to the movie. I watch it and everything is the same. The plot, the character. Each frame is a landmark from my past. <br /><br />Like so many other landmarks from my past.
