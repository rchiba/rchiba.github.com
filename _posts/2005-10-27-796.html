*Note: I have added a link to my SL Snapshot album.<br /><br />Today involved a long bike to a friend's house. This ride of 1.5 miles was quite painful. I underestimated the power of cold, dry wind. After biking about one fourth of the way there, I was trying to convince myself to turn back, but I somehow managed. With each rotation of the pedal on my bike, the pain increased. The cold, stale air ripping the moisture and heat from my lungs and throat. The wind continuing to pull the life out of the tips of my fingers and ears. By the end of the ride, I was out of heat, water, energy, and sanity. <br /><br />Tomorrow, I am going to Chicago. Hopefully, I will come back alive.<br /><br />And another thing. I talked to an old friend from Alabama today. We had a 90 minute long conversation.<br /><br />He said, "Are we still friends?"<br /><br />And ever since we hung up a few hours ago, I've been thinking. What makes a friend?
