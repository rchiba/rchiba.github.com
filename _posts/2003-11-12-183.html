No one really<br />knows much about you... you're an enigma to<br />most of the class.  You're the quiet person in<br />the corner... listening to the teacher,<br />blissfully taking notes, oblivious to the<br />gossip going on around you about you, yourself.<br />And you like it that way.  You tend to be a bit<br />of a loner, but people are fascinated with<br />you... now if you were only a bit more<br />outgoing.... hmmm...
