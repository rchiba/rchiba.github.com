Hey blog-thing. Today was mildly difficult, I guess. Well, no, that's incorrect. It was more painful than hard. I was doing fine at summer gym till I had an asthma attack thing and it felt as thought there were shards of glass in my longs and trachea. I don't cry easily with pain, and I was near tears. That was how bad it hurt. When I got home I tried to jog but twice I got really bad cramps because my food refused to digest. Then, of course, my knee is now swollen and my throat is still a bit sore and I'm coughin. Goodness, no luck for me today. Anyways, it was fun none-the-less. I lost more weight than I had initially thought, so I am that much closer to my goal. I am more flexible than I thought too, and I did 62 sit ups! I'm so happy, lol. I also saw my sister today, she was alright. She got a job at the Pizza King at America's  and to celebrate we got pizza from her. .....But it was undercooked -_- And we gave her a tip too... lol. Anyways,that's pretty much my day. I feel bad because I have to take it easy so I wont get sick, but I still did my sits ups and ab buster, and I got in a quality walk with my mom. So all is good with Amanda today. Except that I'm catching something... -_-
<br />~Amanda
