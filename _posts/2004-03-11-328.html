To pump stress out of my mind, guess what I do? I pump as much kirby/nintendo music into my head as I can.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />The bus is coming in five minuites and I have to hurry. The next 3 or 4 days or so will be spent at Devin's house so my updates might be short. I have to get our "Kingdom Project" organized etc. It's going to be a hard job because Devin is so hard to work with. If all goes well, I think we will get a good grade. Then again, alog things could go wrong.
<br />
<br />Anyways, today is a half day and I'm not sure what to expect. 
<br />
<br />You know? That AIM program never ceases to amaze me at how stupid/redundant it is. I mean, constantly people just say "hi" and then "bye". And constantly use the worst grammar possible. It's just like spam. I don't care to read your spammy, L33T posts. I hate AIM, but I still have it on my computer because some of my friends are attached to it. I have no idea why they become attached to such a vile program. They should get MSN messenger or something because I just hate AIM.
<br />
<br />Anyways, nothing much to say, the bus is coming in 20 seconds so better cut off for now. Will try to update later...
<br />Bye.
