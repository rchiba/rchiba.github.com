I'm trying to get to sleep earlier on the weekends to recover for my sleepless weekdays, but time seems to fly by due to the fact that my mind is used to functioning in the latest of nights. It's just so hard to walk to bed and start sleeping.<br /><br />But, actually, to tell you the truth, I'm in bed right now. As a new "bonding" experience of sorts with my old laptop, I've decided to move it about four feet from the desk to my bed. Now, I'm lying in bed, listening to oldies music, updating my blog, and rewriting my speech. I love my old laptop, in all of its PavilionN5130-ness. Computers usually don't age well, but this computer is an exception. I use it very often, it has never failed, is still as snappy as it was they day I got it, and the built-in speakers on it are absolutely marvelous. Back in the day (six years ago), this machine was bought on eBay as a refurb. Now it's sitting with me in bed, dutifully accomplishing tasks and doing its functions. Back in the day, this machine was a "Media Center" themed computer. It's pretty obvious when you see that it has nice, big speakers and an analog video out port. The screen is a meager 800x600, and it's a old-model Celeron, but it does its job, and does it quite well.<br /><br />Enough about me ranting on about how much I love my laptop. More about today.<br /><br />Robotics made time pass fast, but nothing like how it is rushing by me right now. The build season is quickly getting nearer and nearer to the end. School never ends. During the summer, it's not going to end. It's not going to end next year, or the year after that. Robotics makes me feel like my life is just one long strip of life, never stopping to let me stop to take a breather. I'm not quite sure if this is a good thing or if it is a bad thing.<br /><br />I wish I could go back in time and steal time from my past self. I remember in middle school, I had so much time to do just nothing. It was the Age of Boredom, because I had time to be bored. <br /><br />And how I wish such a time would reappear for just a moment. A day maybe, or perhaps a week.
