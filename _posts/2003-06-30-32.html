I just had chili right now. It was goooooooood. I am full. I will be going to the gym now to work my upper body.
<br />I heard somewhere on the radio that you lose the ability to digest milk at age three and that cow milk is so hard to digest, that the body hardly uses the calcium in it. It said that the best sources of calcium are in leafy vegetables and sesame seeds. I gotta tell that to my Home Ec. teacher next yeatr when she does the milk unit. Ill get a kick debating that! Well thats all for now folks, TATA ;)
