After a nice long weekend of depression and lots of family togetherness I am tired. Perhaps too tired to care? Right now I'm enjoying writing about mental and physical torture and the end of the world and stuff. Oh joy, something to release this pain? I dunno. Maybe. I'm just so tired of this bull shit, pardon my language. Every time I think of Don I feel like kicking him in the nads, pouring anti-freeze in his eyes, making tiny paper cuts, pouring salt water over him, and then boiling him like a flippin' lobster. Or maybe I'll just be satisfied with him living in guilt the rest of his life? I dunno... I'm just so tired of all this crap. I feel like he's crushing my spirit slowly, or in Ryo's terms, stabbing paper clips into my eyes. Mom wont let me see Sunny right now, I might not see her tomorrow and its been about two, three weeks and I'm near my wit's end. I really need someone to talk to. I'm just too tired to care. I feel so dead right now.
