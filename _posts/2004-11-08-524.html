Being demoted to 4th chair as a clarinet in band isn't so bad... is it? I mean, there are plenty of people out there who are worse than me! Ok, fine then, I am just trying to justify my poor performance. So be it. I am a terrible clarinet player, and my poor performance has cost me a niche I loved so dearly, the 1st clarinets... Oh yea...
<br />
<br />Anyways, today was hard, but hopefully tomorow will be more laid back with the half day and all. And about the election. Well, better not talk about that. If I side with one side, the others will probably ban me, and vice versa. Politics should be taboo. I mean, open discussion is great, except when you're illegitimately persecuted by your opinions.

<br />One thing I would like to say about CVS's Pharmacy's photo service is this. It streight forwardly sucks. I walk in to the "one hour" photo development area with 29 digital photos. Luckily, the printer is actually working, so I give them my digital photos and they say that their "backed up" so it sucks because the "one hour" photo is really a "48 hour" photo. 
<br />
<br />I have to go now. I have no time. Seriously, I can't get any work done because I'm typing in my sisters room and she's going to sleep. It stinks.
