I've got this nervous habit of pulling out my hair when I get frustrated or anxious. I'm afraid that my bald spot is growing. Although I cannot see it, I'm sure that the  stresses of school have resulted in more hair loss than I care for. It's me. I see things differently every day. I always say that there are bad days, and that there are good days. The same event can seem like a catastrophe on one day, and a minor inconvenience on another. <br/><br/>That's the issue with my sense of reality. My physics teacher gave the class the "life assignment" of talking "real". <i>But, what is real?</i> Reality changes from person to person, and it's virtually impossible to obtain and analyze correctly a given scenario. If you're going to tell someone the truth, then you have to be sure what the truth is. The world is one where everyone's reality is different, where conflicts arise from many conflicting "truths". So, what does it mean to "be real"? <br/><br/>To tell the truth about my deepest feelings wouldn't do much use, but it's the only "truth" I've got besides math. Everything else I can think of is biased in one way or another. I don't know how other people feel, I don't know how other people think. And what is reality but how our simple minds interpret five simple senses? Maybe he's telling us to not talk at all, because silence is awfully truthful sometimes.<br/><br/>But, it's none of my business to rant on about something abstract like that.<br/><br/>Less hair will be pulled out in the coming days though, hopefully. This week seems like it's rolling pretty well. The movies went great, I won't elaborate on my feelings, but as always they were there. It's amazing, and I feel very lucky and content for the events and people who surround my life. <br/><br/>I'll end it here for today. I've got composition books to write in. Good night.Â
