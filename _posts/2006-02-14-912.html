My computer mouse is frustrating me because the main left button has been responding only sporadically.<br /><br />By sheer coincidence, this girl who sits in front of me in my AlgebraII class has a broken "." key on her calculator. Her key was only working sporadically also. It makes me begin to think... is it really just a coincidence, or is the government secretly trying to disable our computer input devices in some sort of secret ploy to buy more Microsoft mice.<br /><br />At least maybe I've found out a use for all of my stashed lunch money. Maybe I can buy a nice mouse or something. Or a nice keyboard. Either would be just fantastic. And it would affect my daily life, as I use both interface devices very often. Such a purchase would surely be a justified one.<br /><br />Right now, I feel dead. I'll feel dead until the weekend, and then I'll go back to feeling dead again. My life is one long humdrum routine that just keeps getting crazier and crazier.<br /><br />And I still can't sleep due to my chemistry homework. Bleh.
