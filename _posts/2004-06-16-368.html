Summer gym is getting tediouser...
<br />
<br />Average Yo reporting...
<br />
<br />I did yoga today, very interesting coagulation of embarassment and grace. It was great.
<br />
<br />Also, I must resist telling people about this website. At summer gym, I wrote the URL for someone, but quickly remembered to destroy it. Next time it could be worse. 
<br />
<br />Guess what? I was in classrooms for the more vigorous classes (ie. Soccer, Tennis, Etc.)This was because it was raining today, but that's not the point. Anyways, in the tennis classroom, I noticed cords coming out of the recycle bin (trash receptacle)and then I noticed a keyboard. I was too afraid to ask. I didn't want to be alienated furthermore by giving away my position, but that poor, helpless keyboard, stranded for eventual destruction. It bothered me very intensely. The next class, soccer, I found yet another keyboard. I figured that they were having a hardware renovation, and that they were destroying all of the old equipment. This time, I took inishative(I can't spell) and asked for the keyboard. The soccer teacher said yes, and I was overjoyed. You wouldn't believe my overjoyedness of myself after I got my hands on that dirty keyboard. It was covered in pencil shavings and black ink. I got some moist towlettes and promptly refurbished the keyboard, thus saving it from a imminent doom! I feel good. I'm typing on it right now. I think I'll paint it, then name it!
<br />
<br />Anyways, Ryan and I are trying to get an ultralight, but it probably won't succeed and plus, the money is non-existant at this time. Just a silly want.
<br />
<br />I am getting worse and worse at mathematic proficiency. My mind is diminishing to the point where it is of equal computational value as my classmates. It's so scary. Help!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I got a new poll up, plus a new email adress (these servers are much more reliable), and uhhh... That's it.
<br />
<br />Oh yea, I played alot of "America's Army" today. It works! And without much lag! It's groundbreaking, but a timewaster. I really need to learn my html.
