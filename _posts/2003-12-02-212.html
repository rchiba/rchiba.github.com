I am sad. My grades are declining. I have done everything in my power to stop it. I work really hard, but I just can't keep up. No one listens to me. I have to practice my talent show thing AND my clarinet. I am writing an essay that I can not finish. I have no friends and all Shishir does is insult me and make me feel like a nothing. No one likes me. I am a bad person. When they read this they will feel sorry for me. That makes me sad. I have slumped to a level in which people feel sorry for me. Sorry for Ryo Chiba. Everyone stereotypes me and never listens to me. I am sick and depressed of it. I don't have a life. I haven't had fun in months. I do nothing. I am a nothing. All the fun I have is in here. That is all I do, write in my blog. Everyone else has a life. I can't do anything. I tried and failed. I am a failure. Everyone around me hates me. I will never do anything great. I will live and die. I have concluded that I will never be famous, rich or appreciated. No one will notice me. I will die unnotieced. I am a nothing. I will not survive.
