We started band today. Today I also found out about Devin's blog. I'm so jealous of his pseudo-intelectuallity and his chick-magnetness. Devin the intellectual chick-magnet, my role-model. Did I mention that he also is musical too? Crazy mad, I tell you. It's so disapointing for me.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I had band today. He wants us to practice, but we can't take our music home. How in the bloody world are we going to practice if we can't take our music home? This is outrageous. It just doens't make any sense. You CANT practice if you CANT take your music home. It's frustrating me right now. I'm sitting here with a clarinet, and with no music. Practice? What a joke.
<br />
<br />Also, in other news, I have lots of homework, and I am making a movie. Not a good mix. Also, Devin is better than me. And I feel bad... Yea, laugh at my self-pity...
