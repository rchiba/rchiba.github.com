I purchased two pairs of glasses today that make me look like a spiffy eccentric nerd. It's great.<br /><br />Anyways, life seems mixed up when your pupils are taking in too much light. I could hardly read the newspaper. <br /><br />A combination of the pupil dialation and my new glasses turned my world flashy today. Advertisements popped out at me, minute changes in tint were more noticable, and I could count the bricks on the house next door. This is a big deal for me, and even though you can do this easily, it shocks me every time I put on my glasses that I live in a perfectly clean world. A clean world with crisp lines and vibrant colors. It's different from my blurry, bland world of nearsightedness. I suppose sometimes you have to use outside influences to make things around you seem more significant.<br /><br />I was thinking, if you're constantly bored (Like SOME people I know) you should start making a list of something absurd. Yes, I know, I must be some kind of genius from another world, right?<br /><br />For example, you could list all of the reasons you should not stick your head into an oven. Endless possibilities.
