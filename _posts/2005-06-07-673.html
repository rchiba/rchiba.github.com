I'm back in my true home, in the middle of a cornfield. A cornfield in peaceful and aggressively conservative Indiana.<br /><br />Upon returning from my arduous journey home, I started configuring a TiVo unit that I had recieved for marketing purposes. The situation hasn't been working out so far. First, it refused to connect to the server to pull TV guide information since the telephone connection constantly "interrupted." Now, it consistently freezes, refuses to load, sporadically reboots, and makes scary whirring noises. It still can't connet to the server. I'm sure it's a defect of the TiVo unit. It infuriates me to think that a company would release such a defective product. I've spent all night trying to make the box run, and it can't even boot correctly. I just want to toss it into something hard, perhaps a wall or floor of some kind. I have become anti-TiVo. I'm calling customer service tomorrow to sort this nonsense out. Stupid TiVo. We should all buy ReplayTV's.
