So, do you know what DEET is? DEET is that stuff that smells like sweet pine trees, if anyone decided to make pine-tree flavoured candy. I don't know how someone would sell such a thing, but let's move on.<br /><br />DEET is a chemical named, "N-diethyl-meta-toluamide" and it happens to prevent mosquito bites. It works well against ticks too. It looks something like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://chemistry.umeche.maine.edu/Department/Deet.gif"><br /><br /><br /><br />It was made by the Army after they suffered the effects of insect-transmitted disease in the jungle warfare of WWII. DEET entered combat service in 1946 and just 10 years later it was released to the public. <br /><br />A note of caution: Don't spray DEET on spandex. Bad things will happen.<br /><br />That's my random teaching of the day.
