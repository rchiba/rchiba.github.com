I've found something I've been looking for a long time: A decent open source video editor. <a href="http://www.jahshaka.org/">[LINK]</a><br /><br />It's called <span style="font-style:italic;">Jahshaka</span>. Odd name, I agree, but it seems powerful from the tidbits I've experienced of it. Much more powerful than Windows Movie Maker 2. I tried Avid FreeDV <a href="http://www.avid.com/freedv/">[LINK]</a> months ago, but it wasn't compatible with my soundcard. Plus, it isn't open source.<br /><br />I'm still puzzled by Jahshaka's user interface. Video editing is very foreign to me, since I've never really delved into "real" video editing programs before. Hotkeys, menus, buttons, etc. They're all there for me to learn, and for me to use as an excuse to walk away from studying. <br /><br />This year's theme for finals appears to be: "<span style="font-style:italic;">It ain't over until it's over.</span>"<br /><br />I have Precalculus on the last day of finals, so I'm not going to be able to breeze my last day.<br /><br />Ugh... How much I lust for Thursday afternoon.
