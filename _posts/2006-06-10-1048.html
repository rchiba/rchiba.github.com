The movie theater isn't empty. As I walk into the black room, penguins sing and dance on the big screen. The light from the image illuminates seats filled with families with small children. The mood is light. I hear a few kids giggle at the flightless birds. Warm air from the door behind me pushes forward, looking for a space to fill. It urges me to go forward. And so I do.<br /><br />Trying to remain inconspicuous as possible, I rush to one of the seats in the front row. After I sit down, I try to control my Iembarrassment. I quickly glance behind me to see about ten faces of children. I try to understand why I am embarrassed. My reasons are simple. I'm alone, and I'm watching a movie whose target audience is younger than me. Both qualify me as a socially handicapped person. As the movie starts, I hope that there is no one in the audience that knows me. I try to fade into the darkness. But, as the movie starts the light from the screen again sheds light on my situation.<br /><br />Things start to tone down, as I realize that the world isn't paying attention to me, but the movie. I relax. The movie plods along. Simple storyline, the main character gets in trouble, fixes the trouble, gets in more trouble, makes some sacrifices and takes so risks, then saves his friends. The effects are neat, but not top-of-the-line. I admire the character animation, the careful planning in each setting, the little details, like the slight reflection on the plastic trinket on a cabinet sitting in the corner of the bedroom scene. Voice acting is shaky. There were times when I felt the voice and character were detached. But, it doesn't matter. The movie doesn't matter because you, the reader, don't know what it even is. After an hour-and-a-half of movie, the credits start rolling and the kids and their parents start to drift out of the doors in a mass exodus. In the dim light, I sit and watch the credits. Fifteen minutes pass. A few theater employees come in and start sweeping the floor. Out of the corner of my eye, I catch one of them looking at me oddly. I try to ignore it, but the screen saves me the trouble. The credits stop, and the lights kick in.<br /><br />In less than five seconds, I'm out of the theater. I'm in a plaza filled with shops in little neat rows. The sky above me is dark, it's about to rain again. And so I start my walk to the bookstore. In front of me, an elderly gentleman holds a little girl's hand. She looks up at the old man's blue eyes.<br /><br /><i>"Lookie the ladee there! Whats she doing?"<br />"She's window shopping, kiddo. Win-dow shop-ping"<br />"Window shopping, can we do that gran'pa?"<br />"Of course we can do that, honey"</i><br /><br />I get to the bookstore and look around. I pay careful attention to the customers. I visually scan them all to check for anyone I know. I am pleasantly surprised to find that I know no one in the store. I calmly stroll to the corner of the store dedicated to art and architecture books. Being alone, I have the freedom to read whatever I want. My parents would think I was a nut to go and read books in the art section. Exercising my freedom, I pick up a dusty book on the history of architecture and start flipping through the pages, examining the detailed pictures. Fifteen minutes turn the book into a whole lot of boredom, and so I look again through the shelf of books. <br /><br />A little brown book stares back at me, on its cover is scrawled "POSTSECRET".<br /><br /><i>"Postsecret? I remember that website from ages ago. They made a book on it? How exciting!" <br /></i><br /><br />Postsecret, if you don't already know, is <i>"an ongoing community art project where people mail in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard."</i> You can find the site at <a href="http://postsecret.blogspot.com/" title="http://postsecret.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://postsecret.blogspot.com/</a>.<br /><br />I pick up the book and look through it. The introduction looks stale, so I skip it. The book is a collection of all of the postcards sent in, or at least the most notable ones. Every so many pages, there is a striking quote that has been taken from a postcard. I read the quotes. My eyes glaze over and I start feeling heavy. These quotes make so much sense to me. Then, I realize how much sense all of these postcards make.<br /><br /><i>"There are two kinds of secrets. The kind we hide from others, and the kind we hide from ourselves."</i><br /><br />And, I flipped to a random page to the book and the picture of a water-damaged postcard stared back at me. It read:<br /><br /><i>"Your last mortal thoughts will be <b>'Why did you take each day</b> -including today- <b>for granted for so long?</b>"</i><br /><br />And it's a question that we all have to ask ourselves. As you read this, wherever you are, you're losing to time. Each minute that passes. Me typing this sentence, and you reading this sentence, the time it takes us both to do this, we also both get one step closer to not existing. We have to admit that we take our days for granted. We don't do enough. It's so fascinating, scary, depressing, and interesting how life is so great and horrible at the same time. And yet the negative things can never really justify death. <br /><br />Reading through the postcards, you'd think that a lot of the people who write in with their secrets were seriously depressed, even suicidal. But, the odd thing was, many of the secrets on the cards were just like mine. These secrets that we try to isolate actually unite us all. This is what we have in common. And to think, <br /><br /><i>"I'm not alone."</i><br /><br />makes life so much more tolerable. To know that there are others out there who have emotion bottled up inside. To know that there <i>are others</i>. <br /><br />As I walk out of the bookstore, I feel like the bookstore had a much deeper impact on me than the movie that I watched. I get in the car and drive out of the parking lot, out onto the street. At a stoplight, the car in front of me has a sticker on their rear window. It says "Life is Good." And I ask myself, <i>is</i> life good?<br /><br />Ironic, how I was complaining yesterday about how I had nowhere to drive to.<br />
