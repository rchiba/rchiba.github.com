An imagined trail winds through the wall, and my desk cannot contain my thoughts. And I hear a voice behind my right ear. It's a whisper, quiet, urgent, saying my name. It repeats. Through the randomness of my thought, I journey. The beige concrete brick, lecturing English teacher, and dysfunctional projector are all powerless to the daydreaming that infests my midday.<br /><br />She's talking, the lady at the front of the room. The teacher. She's nice, sure. <b>Isn't there something more interesting to look at?</b> The bulletin board is covered with uninteresting little paper people. Yellow construction paper stares back at me. My eyes part with that corner of the room. The image on the projector hasn't changed in the past ten minutes. A worksheet describing literary tools. <i>Tone, word choice, sentence structure.</i> They're just tools. Learning about tools to paint a picture with words. <b>How bland</b>. Picking apart sentences to understand the author's meaning.<b> What a chore</b>. She's talking. I'm not listening. My eyes track her face as she moves around the room. Artificial, purely mechanical movements, my eyes.<br /><br />A departure begins. To another place far, far away from the classroom. Not visually. My thoughts are elsewhere even though I still stare mindlessly at the teacher, at the yellow cutouts of people. And the random thoughts whirl around, questions are asked, scenarios are posed. Nothing is answered, but thinking and imagining is much more appealing than listening to dreck about stylistic choices in literature. I hear nothing that is said in the classroom, I can am now completely isolated from reality. Dreaming, lusting to be in a perfect world without the complexities of the English language.<br /><br /><i>"And, Ryo, what do <b>you</b> think the writer does to make this writing effective?"</i><br /><br />Core exposed. Rushing, rushing. Pounding, tightening, constricting <b>adrenaline</b>. Worry. Fear. <i>Did she really say <b>my</b> name?</i> The words from her mouth. They are foreign to me. I can not think of a response to her question. As I try to react to my situation,  the class turns to look at me. I am instantly rendered useless.  I act as if I am a vegetable.<br /><br /><i>"I, umm."</i> (Silence) <i>"don't. uhh... yeah."</i><br /><br />She's not talking, the lady at the front of the room. The teacher. She's nice, sure. But, she sure is sharp. Caught smack-dab in the middle of daydreaming. The class moves on, and concepts are lectured about, notes taken, and papers shuffled. <br /><br />Notebooks open and my studious peers copy examples off of the white board. I sit there and track my teacher with my eyes. <i>How can she tell?</i>
