The week isn't all over, although my watch tells me otherwise. Fridays are often good. Thankfully, this Friday was no exception. I guess <i>good</i>  isn't very descriptive or interesting. After all, who wants to read a teenager's rant about how things are "good" and how things "aren't good". I'm sure I wouldn't want to read such a thing. <br /><br />Words I write (or rather, type out) usually aren't very optimistic. It's a shame really, because ever since the "Optimist's Club Speech Contest" I did back in middle school, I've aspired to be an optimist. But, I've realized that in reality, optimists are really just de-radicalized idealists. And we all know what happens to idealists. People who put a bright spin on things, so to speak, usually can't solve problems well. Life is a timeline of problems. To these people, there are no problems to be solved, and if there are, the solution will inevitably take place. This logic is <b>wrong</b>. Optimists are impractical and unrealistic. They are the quintessence of visionary. Ignoring something won't make it go away.<br /><br />So I've accepted the fact that I'm never going to be an optimist with this pattern of thought. Pessimists can do the world good. <br /><br />The peak of my pessimism came today in Health class (<i>Which isn't much of a surprise)</i>. Our teacher is having surgery so we have a substitute. I believe that I have mentioned before that our class contains two mentally handicapped kids who sit in front of me. I hate the class and know that there is no purpose for in it, for me at least. The class teaches the same bland information every year. But, each year, the teachers expect us to have never learned it.<br /><br />Like I said, the peak of my pessimism. The substitute teacher had this expectation, and thusly she attempted to have a class discussion about drugs (<i>You don't know what it's like to live in hell until you've discussed the same information for four years)</i>. She talked about privacy concerns involving drug testing. <br /><br />And, at the time, and currently still, I thought of this topic in a very broad sense. Like many things, I found this topic to describe man, as a species, very well. Drugs are much like many things a person can enjoy and covet. Power, sex, money, and violence for example. Outlawing drugs has little impact on the presence of them in society. If drugs are so illegal, why must we drug test most every athlete in most every school in most every state? Why must we, as a society, watch faded, hour-long VHS tapes about <b>something that isn't supposed to exist</b> in the utopia we all dream for? We must because it will never go away.<br /><br />So, in a perfect world there would be no life.<br /><br />No matter how many CEOs the courts send to jail, money will be stolen. No matter how many times democracy is established, another government will topple to the lust for power. No matter how much we try to elevate the layman, there will always be rulers and peasants. Socialism didn't work, communism didn't work, and in the same way, <b>drug prevention won't work.</b><br /><br />At least, that's what I wanted to tell my substitute Health teacher today. But, she just moved onto talking about how the media affects our view on drugs.<br /><br />Oh, how the <b>simple people</b> run in circles.
