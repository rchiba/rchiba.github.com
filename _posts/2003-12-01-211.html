Ok, today was depressing, and a new day for me.
<br />There was much philosophy, laughter, and fun today. I think it was my hat or something. Maybe I should just shut up. I think no one likes me. They probably think I'm a freaky jerk. I mean, Kara had a blast just demoralizing me and the class today. She just wouldn't shut up. So... I guess that makes me angry. But, of course it's just a feeling.
<br />
<br />Today my english teacher came up to me and said that my journals are a bit too anger filled, so I have to chill when I write those things. Luckily every time before I write in this journal, I have a 30 minuite bus ride to calm myself down with. I usually never stay quiet on the bus. I think I am becoming a bad person. I MUST somehow stay quiet. I think it is because I am a teenager, and full of horomones, I talk alot. I like to debate too. Especially with Devin. As a nice fellow, he has some good points. I think under the disguise of annoying juvinile, he really is a genius. We share alot of thoughts, like the war in Iraq.
<br />
<br />About the war, I think that instead of attacking Iraq (who has no "weapons of mass destruction") America should attack North Korea (Proven and Known to have nuclear/biological warfare agents). Japan is under alot of stress right now. With a push of a button, Japan could be OBLIDERATED off of the planet by North Korea. Of course, Japan can't fight back because ,ironically, America made them sign a constitution saying that they can't have a military in WW2. And to make it worse, America is practically forcing Japan and other nations to fight in a war that no one believes in. France cordially and respecably refused to help, and look how America trashed them!!! This is not voluntary help, other nations are being FORCED BY AMERICA to fight in a war where only America profits. It's kinda like slave labor. Other nations help America. America gets all the credit and profit.
<br />
<br />Well, let's stop talking about the war and talk about something more relevant. My life...
<br />
<br />OK, today I don't have much homework to do, but there is a catche. I have to prepare my dance for the "Talent Show". I am VERY afraid. I better practice soon.
<br />
<br />Well, I really need an audio recording device. I am forgetting alot of stuff that is happening in my life. I get the best comments from my brain when I'm walking to lunch. If only I had a audio recording device....
