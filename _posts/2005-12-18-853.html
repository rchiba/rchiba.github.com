If there was one person who I'd admire the most, it would have to be the man who cuts my hair.<br /><br />Imagine dedicating one's own life to the art of cutting off fuzz from other peoples' heads. That kind of commitment is the kind of thing that I admire. Barbers shine with honor, those valiant men and women who make a living by doing something so mundane. Truely, it's amazing that there are people out there who set their ego aside to do this.<br /><br />But, I see people who work in salons in a lower regard. From my experience, they continue to hoard their egos, using overpriced substances (how else can I describe these things?) to enhance one's look. I find this dastardly idiotic.<br /><br />In other news, I'm still obsessed with Blender. I'm absolutely estatic about my large Blender book being shipped to me as I speak.<br /><br />I have a band and law final tomorrow. With luck, I will manage.
