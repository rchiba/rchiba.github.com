Hey blog-thing. Sorrow about the delayed update, again. School has been rush, rush rush. I've been loaded with homework, soccer practice, workouts, and memorization of Japanese words and phrases. It's so much fun, Japanese is my favorite class. I can read almost anything written in legible hiragana. Yay me! Anyways, I have the time to update tonight because I am laid up with what feel like a hairline fracture half the time, and numb the other half, of a foot. Yes, I had a soccer game, and we won 3-1. Of course, some idiots decided to water the field before we got there, creating pot holes and slick spots and plenty of mud. As I went to bomb a ball that was coming my way, my foot caught in a pothole, twisted, and hit the rapidly speeding ball wrong, crunching my boot foot. It hurts. Kurt (my stepdad) tried to fix it, and that was ever so painful. But, it helped a bit and the swelling stopped. Yayness.
<br />In other news, I am about to begin work on my book, yet again. I love it. The tension building in it gave me the jumps last night, it was awesome (in some weird sort of way). Anyways, all for now. I hope my foot injury isn't serious, the tournament is just another two weeks away! (one more game to go!) Talk later!
<br />~Amanda
