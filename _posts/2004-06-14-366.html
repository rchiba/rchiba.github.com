Today I went to summer gym. 
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />
<br />There's this kid named, well I can't tell you. And he sits in front of my in summer gym. He's very talkative in a very bad way. It's kind of an anti-social sociality. It's complicated. Anyways, he talks and talks and talks, and worst of all, he has no idea of how to wait your turn. Persay, I'm talking to a friend, and this kid comes up and starts interrupting us and starts talking to us about meaningless topics that don't concern me. He asked me if I liked NASCAR, I said no. He kept on talking anyways about how he was a buick person, but he liked fords too.... and on and on.... and it got to a point to which was agrivating and crazy at the same time. That was like last week. Today, this kid asked me if I had a PS2 and I said no. The kid then starts talking about this game called "Devil May Cry". He praises it and keeps saying its really "good". Very poor adjective usage. Anyways, he memorized the whole intro scene and he repeats it like it's his mission to sell this game and lead me into insanity at the same time. He goes on and on and on.
<br />
<br />At least this kid makes summer gym look easy, because anyone would rather run a lap than talk for on and on.
