Have you ever wondered what a yuppie is? I mean, you hear it in movies and such, but does it have a proper defined meaning?<br /><br />Yes. Yuppie stands for "Young Urban Professional." Yuppies are usually characterized by their conservative attitudes (opposite from previous hippie generation), their intense value for expensive material goods, their corporate jobs, and their fast paced lifestyle. Yuppies are usually around twenty or thirty and they hold jobs in professional fields. They usually obsess over expensive cars and ritzy houses and they congregate in groups. Yuppies seem casual on the outside, but inside their complicated yuppie culture, they are guided by strict ettiquette. When in groups, they can be found in their natural habitat, trendy cocktail bars and expensive country clubs. Yuppies are selfish, superficial, and can't find true value in things that don't cost lots of money. They often find themselves purchasing convenience goods, because of their fast lifestyle. Yuppies have "bad taste" and buy expensive things for the sake of buying expensive things. <br /><br />Some extra terminology you might want to remember, just in case a man on the street pulls out a gun and points it to your head, then starts to ask trivia questions.<br /><br />A buppie is an african american yuppie.<br /><br />A guppie is a gay yuppie.<br /><br />A "yuppie food stamp" is a crisp $20 bill fresh from the ATM.<br /><br />"Yuppicide" is the killing of yuppies. (Preferably with chainsaws, as all horror movies have at least one yuppie in them.)<br /><br />Vehicular "Yuppicide" is when you collide with a ritzy Lexus and kill the yuppie occupants/occupant.<br /><br />Picture time!<br /><img SRC="http://www.wackypackages.org/stickers/91_topps/11_front_yuppie_chow_small.jpg"><br />So now you know your yuppie vocabulary. Why don't you go use it?
