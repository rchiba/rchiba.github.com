<p>Happy Birthday Blogger.
<br />You're probably thinking, "How does that effect you or me?". Well, if you look above, there are no ads! Halleluiea, I don't know how to spell it. I mean, I'm not religeous. Anyways, I figured out how to post pictures easier, so now I won't have to spend 30 minutes trying to get the pictures to load. I've also noticed that alot of bloggers my age sound alot like me, except Devin of course. They always start out as saying, "Hey, I'm nobody, and no one will listen to me, and who cares about me? and bla bla bla..." Well, I'm thinking of changing that kind of outlook. I suppose if you look above, underneath my title, you see me saying the same thing. I've kept the same everything for a LONG time, and you can kind of tell, by looking at the template. Being part of my template, that sentence is still up there. The sentence I wrote in the heat of the summer. The sentence I wrote more than a year ago. There it sits, conveying my desperate hope of drawing YOUR attention to MY pitiful existance. I read Devins, Kevins, Jessis blogs. All of them plus mine have something in common. They all talk about how stupidly insignificant their little lives are. In reality, they are insignificant and stupid, but you shouldn't think like that. If we little bloggers stood up for ourselves and blogged away on our nerdy machines, I bet we could make a difference. That's what I've learned today. I've learned that you shouldn't go talking about how insignificant you are, because by the time you know it, you are insignificant. If you keep the illusion in your head that you are significant, that someday, someone will notice you... then someday, someone might indeed notice you. Some day..... What a petty illusion.....</p><p>Anyways, enough with me daydreaming here and there, and averywhere.It's 8:52 (the clocks wrong by the way) and I have to write on. This is so fun. I just realized that blogging is a hobby now. Over the summer, it got to be a chore. But now that I'm dealing with homework, society, tests, general stress... Blogging is fun. Fun for me, fun for my inner self. I guess fun for other people. Talking about other people....</p><p>I noticed that alot of my 7th grade pals are making blogs. The trend spreads eh? Well, I support them and everything, but I feel jealous. I don't know why I feel jealous. I have no idea. I just feel this envy... This sense that if I am not better than them, they will overpower me. I know blogging isn't a war game, but it's just at the back of my head. This immense envy of something that isn't a threat.</p><p>Also, I noticed that some of my math classmates are on the primitive stage of compter skills. Their main use for the computer? Instant Messenging. I absolutely hate the fact that they think they are computer literate, but in reality they have no clue what protocols need installing, that their Internet Explorer has so many security holes that it couldn't hold jello, that AIM and AOL are hardware hogs. They just click a button, and the computer either works or doesn't. They just... just... make me want to teach a computer class or something. I want to spread my computer prowless onto these illetirate people. They are deprived with this... and I wish I could give it to them. Of course, they probably don't care. There was this kid in front of me in math. The looks at the back of a CD case and goes, "Woah! Macromedia Shockwave!". He acted like he knew what he was talking about. I don't think he did. Macromedia Shockwave is a common standard in animation. Their flash format pwnz the internet community. Why would he be excited about having it on his computer? Maybe he was trying to act like a nerd. Maybe he just has a crappy computer that can't handle flash. Maybe he's crazy. Who knows. </p><p> </p><p>I've been typing for like 30 minutes now. Ranting on and on. I feel better about everything because of this blog. It's a very thereputic hobby. I love it so much. Until next time, blogger. Bye bye.</p>
