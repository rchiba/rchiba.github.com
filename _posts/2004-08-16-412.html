For some reason, the blogger service has been off and on over the past 2 days. I REALLY hope they don't go down. If you see a TON of posts below, it's because over the course of today, I have clicked the publish button. This is because everytime I pushed the publish button it said, "remote servers terminate connection" or something like that. So I pushed it over and over again, and I guess it posted over and over again, even though it said, "remote servers terminate connection". Sorry for the inconvenience, and even though no one reads this to care, Have a nice day.
