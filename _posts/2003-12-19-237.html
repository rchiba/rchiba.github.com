Ok, now the break starts, woohoo?
<br />
<br />Anyways, today was the talent show and I (yes me, the serious japanese dude doing his homework in the corner) was in it! I dressed up in a cow costume and danced moronically in front of the whole school. Very interesting reactions.... Before the talent show started, I was practicing at school. I wanted to try something new so I decided to try a backflip. I crushed my neck and now it is sprained. I look like a moron with my head bent to the left all the time. Anyways, I went on stage and performed with a hurt neck. Owwie...
<br />
<br />All throughout the day it snowed, then it all melted in a 30 minuite period right before school ended. That just blew my hopes away for having a white christmas. Oh, maybe next year. This year I have to stay in this room in front of the box with pretty lights, typing on plastic keys with letters on them. I really should go on to write a disclaimer about my website and how people at school get offended about it. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I can't find a place that has independent free techno music downloads. If you have any suggestions, PLEASE EMAIL ME! Anyways, I got a 92% on my science final. It was sub-par, but it could have been worse. At least I got an A. Anyways, I am going to be lonely over the next week, so might as well fight it by typing on the blogosphere. I really hope blogger doesn't go down. I REALLY HOPE. Anyways, the internet is pretty new and all right? So I am wondering what will happen as it ages. I hope everything remains free. That is one of the few reasons I go on the internet, because information is free! And it rightfully should.

<br />Well, that is all I can think of to talk about. I had a ton of more stuff to talk about, but I forgot them all, being the forgetful person I am. I wish more people would read this, but I wish more people wouldn't talk about it at school. That won't be a problem considering that it is the beggining of winter break.
<br />That is all
<br />Bye
