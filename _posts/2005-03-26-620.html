What's been going on?<br /><br />Well, Blogger hasn't been posting my posts lately, to my dismay (The last one was pretty large.); hopefully, today it'll post.<br /><br />Well, let me ask that question again.<br /><br />What's been going on? Well, I went to the local home renovation megastore to get paint. This paint will be applied tomorrow in the bonus room. It's a bit of a cottage theme. Another thing that is happening is that I'm still trying to figure out T-Mobile's policy on picture messaging to emails. If this is considered "data" covered by my "Unlimited t-zones" plan or if it considered an "analog picture message". After much combing through endless pages of miniaturized text, I still can't find anything pertaining to my question. I've already sent them my 2nd email. I'm presuming that they will reply tomorrow.<br /><br />By the way. I burned a new CD called "Stuffo." It's got some smooth 80's pop. Itz da "shiz nit."
