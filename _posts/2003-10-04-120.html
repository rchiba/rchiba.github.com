Today, I am feeling timid.
<br />I went to kyle's house. Oh yea, YOU STUPID PEOPLE who hate me. Read fridays thing i typed so you can shut up. Ok, at kyle's house everyone ingnored me. I don't know why I come to these birthday partys. I go to shishirs and Jak is such an idiot to insult me and nag me to death. I don't like hime sometimes. And all we did was play halo so what's the point??? I don't get it. Shishir is right next to me because he is spending the night. 
<br />Ok, shishir wants to write something to the people so here goes
<br />
<br />Shishir:just so you know,i am going to have a website soon and i'm goiong to make fun of all the popular people at school so watch out.
<br />
<br />Back to me, shishir is just using my site as a stepping stone to sell off his site. That advertiesing prick. 
<br />
<br />Shishir:I am not a prick and this isn't a business, its just a website
<br />
<br />Yea, right shishir, *whispers*prick*whispers*
<br />SO, he is getting bored because he is unstable so ill just leve. Ok, email me and remember POLL POLL POLL!
<br />HAPPY DAYS;)
