I made three models, spent about 6 hours modeling, and am trying to create an industrial landscape/building similar to the petroleum tank above.<br /><br />But, the really odd thing is, this program has gotten to my head. I find myself trying to control reality using the hotkeys, trying to navigate through 3d space using the middle mouse button, shift, and the numeric keypad. I look at a building and see not a building, but see the building as planes made up of vertices and textures, the curves being simulated by computer algorithms. To move around, I try to hold down the shift key and drag, but find my hands clicking buttons that aren't there, my eyes staring into a monitor that does not exist. <br /><br />And after using the program for so long, it's hard to draw a line between simulated reality, and reality itself. What I see on the computer is just as realistic to me as what I see outside of the computer. I'm slowly adjusting to handling 2 worlds at once, but it's sometimes confusing. The hotkeys for movement, edge selection, and scaling is so wired into my brain.<br /><br />But, I think it's all worth it. Discovering Blender was and is like discovering the pen and pencil all over again. It's a new tool, a fun new tool to build a world out of nothing, and make it look good too.<br /><br />So, that's the end of the fabled "Thanksgiving Weekend". <br /><br />Now it's time to hit ground running, so to speak, and go to school tomorrow. Yippee!
