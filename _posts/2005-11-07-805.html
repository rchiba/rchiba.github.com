<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3367/196/1600/forum.png"><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 419px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 217px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" height="217" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3367/196/400/forum.png" width="405" border="0" /></a> Apparently, my photo has caused some controversy among SecondLife forumites.
