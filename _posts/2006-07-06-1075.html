I hate talking about politics or economics or anything of that sort. I used to love it, but looking back at my ignorance, I've learned to keep (or try to keep, rather) my mouth shut during conversations, or arguments about these topics. I hate talking about these things because I hate people who talk about politics or social crises. As I've said too many times before, "hate" is a strong word. "Hating" a group of people is a very unfair generalization, but in this case, I figure that almost everyone has no idea what he or she is talking about when they discuss politics, so I consider my negative attitudes toward this group of people (everyone) as justified. It's one thing to believe in something, but it's another to take the belief and attempt to shove it down other peoples throats. I've been guilty of this charge many times in the past, and I'm ashamed to admit so. <br /><br />But, I'm glad I've realized how stupid I am. Some people never figure it out. My revelation has resulted in countless silences of myself during discussions of this nature. Always, I feel this pressure to tell everyone how I feel about a particular issue, but I control myself and only share my feelings with my closer peers. <br /><br />People always enjoy citing statistics. If the math says "yes", then it must be so, no? But, statistics are often superficial. Drug companies do multiple trials for their new drug, and throw out the trials that don't give them good results. The "bad" statistics, or the numbers that do not favor the company, are discarded, and the "good" statistics are paraded on magazine covers, newspaper ads, and television commercials. Statistics for any given controversial topic are the same way. We, as fervent consumers of information, have no more knowledge of the validity of a statistic than a cherry tomato does of its own existence.<br /><br />Throwing statistics out of the window, that leaves questions of value, of morality, or of ethics. And the answers to these questions are always different for each person. So, I figure that humanity will be forever plagued by meaningless banter and argument over topics that have no perceived relevance to ones life. I embrace this, but at the same time, strive to abstain from this primitive act. Only in a perfect world, an empty and dead world, can nature be separated from conflict. We are distinctly alive creatures, and as such, conflicts define us. <br /><br />I drew in my sketchbook today. Drawing is more productive when you know that you do not have the physical strength to do anything more strenuous. I sometimes can't stand drawing because I know I could be doing something more productive elsewhere (although these notions are usually false).<br /><br />My cup of ice water has run dry. Off to bed for me.
