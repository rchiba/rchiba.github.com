I was looking at my watch this afternoon to check what day it was. Today was cloudy, and I sat in my dark corner of the house. So, by the light of the computer, I squinted to make out the numbers on my watch, and what a surprise it was to realize that tonight is going to be the night most societies are going to transition into the new year. But, if one looks a bit deeper into "new years" and such, one can see these worldwide celebrations are for a very trivial, shallow reason. Time has been quantified by humans, in increments and units based both on mathematics and other people. <br /><br />Think about it, there are quite a few people who aren't even on the "standard" Gregorian calendar system. What is the signifigance of this "new year" to them? <br /><br />To them, it means nada, zip, zilch. I know, it's cliche, but work with me here.<br /><br />And to think, if we got all the money wasted on baked goods, alcohol, pyrotechnics, confetti, and replacement lampshades for new years celebrations and used it on aid and sustenance packages for the needy, world hunger would probably end for a day or two. But, who wants to give up a party in exchange for a life? Apparently, not many people.<br /><br />So I'd like to shy away from all the sappy "New Years" bullshit that usually consists of "I *heart* everyone for this fantastic new years and new years resolutions and crap... blah, blah, blah." Personally, I'm sick of holidays. I'm sick of trying to control my envy, hearing about how much everyone got for Christmas, and attempting to convince myself that I don't care about how much everyone else got. I'm sick of certain Apple products being shoved in my face while waiting in line in a grocery store by some visibly broke, odorous, single-parent, mother who can't afford to buy a carseat and doesn't have enough intelligence to install it even if she could afford the sticker price.<br /><br />An amazing thing happened to me tonight. I turned on the television and watched it for more than 15 minutes. Even if I was watching an old History Channel re-run on cocaine, the fact that I did something so unproductive is still disgraceful. Perhaps I will whip myself for that.<br /><br />The household computers, or one of them, didn't like me today. More specifically, the external card-reader doesn't want to make friends with the computer's drivers. I plug the card reader in, and everything's fine, until I put my SD card in, upon which the two imbecile inanimate objects decide (even if they can't really "decide", persay) to fritz and lock up. After the reboot, McAfee decides to randomly uber-scan my hard drive, just to piss me off. Many reboots and curses later, the desktop actually responds, and I get my anti-virus (I do not consider McAfee anti-virus software anymore) assault team going. <br /><br />So I suppose my new years celebration is going to consist of cleaning the computers out of muck. Fantastic. Fun, fun, fun. I'm just rolling in fun, aren't I?<br /><br />Happy New Years, you Gregorian conformist bastards.
