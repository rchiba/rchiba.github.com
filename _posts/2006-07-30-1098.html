I worked the morning shift today. I woke up at six for a few seconds. I opened my eyes and turned my head just enough to be able to recognize the numbers on my watch. I had a split-second mental debate on if I should wake up this early, or invest in the sleep. I ended up sleeping more. Until eight. Ate breakfast, checked my email, biked to the pool. 9am-11am is pure manual labor. There's always something to push around, carry out, clean, or empty.<br /><br />One of the more memorable moments this morning was when I tried to refill the soap dispenser in the men's bathroom. Earlier, Ryan told me about how he had to do something about the soap dispenser, and I just sort of nodded along. I discovered that listening is important when I poured a big helping of antibacterial handsoap into the dispenser. Immediately after the soap started filling up, the plastic bottom fell apart, spilling the soap. Soap on the sink, on the floor, on the wastebasket, on my hands, and on my clothes. Needless to say, soap isn't a cure-all for uncleanliness when it's covering everything within arm's reach.<br /><br />I work the morning shift tomorrow. Hoorah.
