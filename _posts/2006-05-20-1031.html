It's half an hour before midnight, and I'm supposed to be sleeping. <br /><br />I met up with a friend today to study. After studying, we went to the park. Got conscripted to paint chairs at the neighborhood park. A few hours, three paint cans, and a malfunctioning spraying machine later, all of the wooden pool furniture was painted. Wholesome community service, oh how it burns my eyes and aches my back. My knees hurt as well, but that's more because of all of the jumping I've done in the past few days.<br /><br />I'm tired. My fingers are heavy on the keyboard. The buck stops here, until tomorrow.
