If there's something that changed today, it would be my outlook on Robotics Club.<br /><br />I sacrificed quite a few things to be with semi-strangers, in a setting that I was not accustomed to, doing a thing that I was not experienced at doing. The Robotics Club met up in a woodworking area in the school and we built a crate together. This cratebuilding began at six in the evening. Because I found travelling 30 minutes to my home as an inefficient waste of time, I decided to just rough out the two hours between DDR Club and Robotics. So, I did tough it out. I sat in the cafeteria windowsill for two hours, doing homework. And sometimes, the best times are when you are alone. While I was sitting there, talking to myself as I did my chemistry, I felt good. I felt good about getting something done, that being my chemistry worksheet. I felt good about doing it on my own. I felt good being in an empty, dark windowsill. The hum of the janitor's cleaning machines and the whir of the vending units created an atmosphere of mechanical clarity. The background noise did not distract me, but instead drowned out my voice, so I could talk to myself without the risk of alerting a janitor to my presence. And so, I sat in a dark cafeteria for two hours, in peace.<br /><br />I came into the woodshop at six in the evening, just as planned. To tell you the truth, I had doubts, and perhaps I still do have doubts. I had doubts about this whole the whole Robotics Team getting something done, working together. From the body language from the previous meetings, I've personally felt that the group dynamics weren't so preferable in this Team. We've got really smart people, really quiet people, really loud people, really mundane people, and really calm people on hand. But, the feel of the team was, and still is, a bit rough, gritty like sandpaper. And this is why I did not pay my T-shirt fee, <br /><br />because I thought to myself, "If this meeting doesn't go so well, I can quit and I won't lose any cash."<br /><br />And so even though I had my money in my pocket, I held onto it along with the doubt that locked me into a rock and a hard place, so to speak.<br /><br />The meeting went smoothly, and things worked out. As Alex often says, "It just works."<br /><br />And this time, like many other times, Alex was right. It did "just work", and the amazing thing about it was that it didn't "just work", but it actually impressed me. With communication, things got done, and quite efficiently at that. People didn't bicker, people didn't shout. The people on the team made me feel not like an outsider, but like a real life person. And I felt good about it. My peers, and myself as well, impressed me, and because of this my doubt is eradicated.<br /><br />So, the moral ditty for today? <br /><br />Well, why the fuck should I even call these things morals? These things are just things that I should have figured out a long time ago, but haven't. They just seem like morals because I'm too incompetent to discover them like everyone else has. But I digress...<br /><br />Being alone is always fantastic, but being part of a group isn't all that bad either.<br /><br />The above statement sounds like something you'd read in one of those idiotic "Chicken Soup for the <insert ADJECTIVE HERE> Soul". If this bothers you in any way, you're not alone, because it sure does bother me.
