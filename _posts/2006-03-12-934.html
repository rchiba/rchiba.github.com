I am back from my robot adventures in Ohio. As it is 3:34AM currently, I am planning to go to sleep soon.<br /><br />As an exciting side note, I won the regional AVA (Autodesk Visualization Award) for my animation. Seeing that our robotics team is a rookie this year, it's all the more surprising that we win this award, which is usually geared toward veteran teams. This does not bode well for me. My heightened ego will inevitably result in much pain and suffering. I see it coming.<br /><br />The robotics competition was a sight to behold. Fourty two teams in all, some hailing from places like New York and Pennsylvania, all in a large stadium with projector displays surrounding the well-lighted, robot arena.<br /><br />Screaming, flying disks, and loud dance music were only a few things that made this event as exciting as it was.<br /><br />Now it's 4PM and I've realized that if I don't get to sleep, it'll be morning.
