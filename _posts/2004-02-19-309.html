Hello blog-thing. I'd like to start this post by saying... I'M CHEESED OFF! I totally support Ryo's post from the other day, and I am sad to report that I've seen that too. It's disgusting. People don't like some of the non-popular people jut by their looks! THEIR LOOKS! People can't help the way they're born or what they like! It's absolutely ridiculous to hate someone for being who they are. Now, I won't mention names, but a certain Alpha female REALLY cheesed me off by, when (....) went by, she said 'She's evil!' I replied 'why? I think she's nice!' and I apologized to (....) for crying out. I didn't want her to think I was being rude. Then this certain alpha said. "You like her?" and I said "yeah, she's nice." the stupid alpha replied, in her coldest, shallowest way. "I don't like her!" I proceeded to ask why, and I sure got a slap in the face! "well... Look at her!" was the lame excuse! Then I proceeded to interrogate and the stupid, inconsiderate, horrid alpha said "she's musty." and then laughed! I interrogated further and the idiotic alpha said, "look at her! her clothes, what she wears. ya know?" I was so outraged! I lost it and said "well gee, you're sure low." I was SOOOO mad and am still mad. How can someone judge another person by their outward appearance and treat them with scorn. I've seen some pretty ugly and nasty things in my life, but this is one of the few things thatmakes me loose my temper and want to off the whole bloody world! Of course this results in my own ridicule because then I can't control my accents and then I sound like a cross between all the ways I've learned to talk. Honestly, people at East Tipp have no compassion. Don't these dumb aplphas (sorry Ryo, I used your term) know how to treat people? Have they no manners? Where they born in a soddin barn? Don't they KNOW this leads to suicide, mental problems, and other things like Ryo mentioned? This drove my sister over the edge! WHY WON'T PEOPLE LISTEN?!!?!?!?! Is it so hard to show a LITTLE common courtesy to others? To be polite? How do these people expect to make it in the real world?! Why can't they just listen for once? How the heck do you think they'd feel if they were treated horridly? I think the teachers should do like that. Call parents and then teach them a lesson. Neglect them, not pay attention. Someone, if not the teachers should. Or else these idiots will become a power hungry vengeful mob! Common sense, that is all I ask! that and a little bit of kindness.
