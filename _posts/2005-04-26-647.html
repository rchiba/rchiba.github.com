I feel terrible.<br /><br />So terrible that I actually missed school. I live life in fifteen minute increments because that's how long I can sleep before having to either vomit, blow my nose, or having a athsma attack. I have post-viral bronchial hyper-activity. Whatever that's supposed to mean. I'll go sleep now.
