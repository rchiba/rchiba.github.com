I hate it, and I can't admit it to myself. I played Sim City 4 for over two hours today. It's a powerful addiction. So now, if you hear me complain about homework, think bad thoughts of me. Hate me. Be really pissed off at me and don't feel shy about being vocal about how you want to take a brick to my head. <br /><br />On a positive note, I'll be building bridges tomorrow at Tiffany's house. I found some Gorilla Glue at my house and used it to make vermicelli triangles. What surprised me the most was the fact that Gorilla Glue needs water to function, and that it foams up to three or four times its size while bonding. Who knew that something you see in SkyMall magazine would be so useful?  <br /><br />As for bridge design, I'm leaning toward some sort of simple truss bridge. Tif and I will have to agree on one together, but in the mean time I'll tell you that I find the Pratt Truss my favorite for its visual appeal. <a href="http://www.matsuo-bridge.co.jp/english/bridges/basics/truss.shtm" target="_blank">OMG BRIDGES r FUNzorz![LINK]</a><br /><br />Walking into the Barber Shop, I felt anxious on the inside. I put on a smile and tried not to show what was going through my mind. <i>This is a half a years worth of hair man, what are you doing?</i> These old, but lively barbers have a tendency to take as much as they can off of my head. I've known from three years of their service. Half an hour and two chapters of Moby Dick later, I'm gazing into a mirror looking at my hair. It's different.<br /><br />It's a bad thing to be a vain person, but wouldn't you feel like staring into a mirror after taking off what feels like whole kilograms of hair? <br /><br />
