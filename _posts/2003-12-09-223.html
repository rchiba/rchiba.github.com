Hello, average yo here to talk about my life which is hated by others. Operation "Outcast" is proceeding well and I am soon on the way  to outcastdom. Anyways, I have realised that my school is a one full of rejects. Morons and idiots surround me in a surreal fashon, as if I was meant to be with mental cases. They hover, co-exist, enjoy themselves, untill lo and behold kills them. In this fashion, people die. My lunch table is getting more interesting. I discuss with them the political follies of the men who run this nation. We have a great time making fun of Bill Clinton and the Iraqui war. Muhahahha, down with propaganda!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am bored. My life is bad and untalented compared to amanda's. I have been feeling jealous all day and night, but of course, I am always jealous. Because I am the average yo. Emphasis on the average...
