I just went to the gym with my dad. It was very strenuous on my legs and I had TONS of leg spasms today. It was not pretty. I got a good workout though. I feel tired. So tired. Dinner is soon though, which is good. We are having ribs today, YAY! I am soo happy and hungry. I cant wait for the ribs to get in my mouth. Also, I had an embarassing moment. I left my swimming pants at the desk and a teenage girl had to bring it to me. It was very embarassing. Weirdly, this has happened to me before. Except it was even more embarassing. I left my underpants on the desk. TOTALL MISTAKE! EMBARASSMENT GALORE! DONT DO THAT AGAIN! You get the point. Well, thats all for the underpants stories... TATA;)
