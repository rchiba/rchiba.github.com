Hello again.  Today wasn't too bad.  The ISTEP essay questions were the worst part of my day including the rest of the dtupid ISTEP tests.  MAN do I hate those tests!  They really get an my nerves!  Anyway, during spring break, the eight grade gets to go on an awsome trip.  I don't know if I should tell you where if anyone reading this doesn't know what I'm talking about.  I don't want anyone getting mad.  Oh well, I'll tell you anyway.  We get to go to D.C.  Ya you heard me...Washington D.C.  I can't wait.  Well, I gotta go.  ADIOS AMEGOS!!! ;)
