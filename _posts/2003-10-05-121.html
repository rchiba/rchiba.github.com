Publicizing my site was a bad idea wasn't it. I should have never told Ryan, or Brandi , Shishir, or ANYONE. This is bad. Its badly bad. Supersubstantially terrible. Ryan sent me a very complementary letter though. I can't wait to talk to him later. I see the real world of emotions facinationg. I want to go to school, stir up emotions, and see the reactions. Its like a chemical mixture actually. All this hate directed toward me makes me want to actually go to school. I can't wait till everyone insults me again. It's like a party. Fun for me.. WHEEE... Lets all celebrate for the chaos I have concocted. Maybe I can become a phycologyst. Studying peoples minds, some are enigmas, some are padlocks, and some are crosswords. I love the human mind! It gives me a whole new outlook on life. Whenever someone hates me, I can just study it and record the information. Its very interesting. Anyways, tommorow I get to go to school. Yaay. I want to see everything in a new prespective. I want to talk to Ryan and why he praised me so. The e-mail , oddly enough, didn't sound like it was from him. Maybe someone is pulling a big prank on me. I can't wait to find out. I hope I can devise theoreys I can elaborate on ,in my head ,on the bus. I like doing that. Pretending that I am a professor. Now that would be great wouldn't it. I probably don't posses the intelligence and prominence in society to do something like that though. Or, I could become a theorist. That is a possibility.
<br />Well, Happy days ;)
