Alot happened today. I arrived home from Ryan's house and saw Adam Thomas, planned a garage painting project, went to Lowe's to get some paint, painted, and went on a Pocket PC freeware escapade. Oh yea, did I forget to mention my new Ipaq? It's a multi-purpose device. It's going to be more functional when my keyboard arrives. Anyways, my garage is huge and my family and I painted it orange. I can't believe it only took 1 day. I'm tired.
<br />
<br />Anyways, you remember that kid that I said liked killing things? Well, I've also found out that he's been smoking since he was 10. I'm not that surprised, and yet, I am. Why and how would someone start smoking at 10. Smoking was for losers when I was 10, and it still is. Amazingly, this kid is pretty nice. He's friendly and responsive, not withdrawed and angry (like some people I have observed). It's very odd how first impressions can be so confusing. I can't help feeling angry at him, but at the same time, I hate him. It's odd. I'm odd.
