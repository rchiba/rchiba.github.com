I feel enlightened.<br /><br />Many of my peers did not feel so enlightened today. Just my luck that right when I can relax and be happy, people around me get irritable. Other people's actions are other people's actions. Not my place to meddle.<br /><br />Here, I'd like to type my opinion about how other people act, but I've learned that these ideas may seem developed to me at the time, but soon turn out to be flim-flam nonsense.<br /><br />I learned how to texture things today. So I'll mark that down as one of my miniature accomplishments. Gotta' start tallying these things up.
