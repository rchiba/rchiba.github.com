Halleluya
<br />I have no home work. And guess what? I am a MILLIONAIRE!!!!!!!!! Just kidding, unfortunately. I am getting sleepy because I have nothing to write about. My finger is getting better, but it still cant bend all the way. I am hoping to go to Kyles house and pet his sheepies. He is a farmer and they have tons of sheep. They are SOooooooooo Cute!!! CUTE!!! I luv them so much, untill the get slaughtered, MUAHHAHHAHAH. Lamb, its whats for dinner.;)
