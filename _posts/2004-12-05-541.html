You can't really say that your weekend was swell, if you had no real weekend at all. Homework was one of my most time-consuming activities this weekend. Everybody else was probably having "fun". I don't remember what "fun" is. It's unreachable for me. Others also have "time". I don't recall what that is either.
<br />
<br />My opinion article for journalism just sounds like a elongated rant. My feature for journalism is so bad that I refuse to look at it. My room is a mess, and I can't find my socks for tomorow. What a diabolical state I am in. I can't even find my socks for tomorow...
<br />
<br />Over the next week or so, I will be submitting to the great time-hungry demon called "diving meets". He will command me to give him all of my free time. I must obey. I will also have another demon called "homework". He'll torture me until I become suicidally depressed. These two demons come and in hand, for they'll be working together this week. I'm sad.
<br />
<br />I can't feel like I'm desperately trapped in a small hole with no top or bottom. I just keep falling until I feel like giving up. I won't give up.
