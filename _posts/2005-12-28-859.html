I tried to accomplish lots of things today, but sometimes one cannot help but feel like something that was supposed to happen didn't.<br /><br />On a side note, while traveling to Alabama, I went to this Chinese restaurant. I'm the only one in my family that can actually tolerate those "fortune cookie" things, so this time, like every time, I was stuck with four fortune cookies.<br /><br />You know, it's always nice to have four fortunes. If one of them is a bad/unappealing fortune, then you can just forget about it and open the next cookie.<br /><br />Sometimes, they're not even fortunes. The first fortune that was handed to me by the mystical "fortune cookie" higher beings was, "It's Nice to be Important, but It's More Important to be Nice". That is definitely not a fortune, but I still found it very witty. Now it's in my memory so when the time comes, I'll be able to bust it out and impress my peers with my simulated wittyness.<br /><br />I forget the second and third fortunes (they're never the important ones), but the fourth and final fortune still sticks out in my mind.<br /><br />The paper slip inside of the delicate treat said, "You will be given an amazing offer today. Accept it!"<br /><br />The fact that it said "today" meant that it was a one-time event. But, that day, there were no "amazing offers" that I could accept. When I went to bed that night, I felt dark disappointment. Although the fortunes are destined to never come true, and are there for pure novelty, there was still a sad sort of cloud that came about after realizing that these mystical, oriental fortune-telling cookies lie.<br /><br />But, back on topic, no matter what I do, there is never enough satisfaction. Today, I completed a few Blender tutorials, drew, and updated my DeviantArt nonsense. I'm a "get stuff done" kind of person, and if I don't "get stuff done", then I feel like a festering sore on the skin of time. Even on supposed "breaks" like these, the stress seems to build up. There's stress from the impending doom/return to school, and additional stress from me trying to figure out what do accomplish over the free time I am given.<br /><br />But, at least I have a plan for tomorrow. <br /><br />While browsing through good 'ol digg.com, I found <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/feature/geek-to-live-how-to-host-a-personal-wiki-on-your-home-computer-126052.php">Instiki</a>. This concept of a locally stored, globally accessed, personal wiki facinates me.<br /><br />Thus, it is now my dutiful mission to get my own wiki up and running, for the sake of, well... getting my own wiki up and running.<br /><br />Hopefully, tomorrow will bring good fortune in my wiki-creation endeavors, although now I know that there will be no "amazing offers" to accept.
