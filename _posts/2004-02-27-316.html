If I could help her I would. If she wanted to kill me I'd let her. If I had to walk across a desert of fire I would. If I had to die to make her truly happy, I'd gladly die. 
<br />If I could help her, I would. No one understands that. I hurt, and I don't know why. Why the pain in my head and heart hurts so much. I haven't hurt this much in so long. I try to tell myself not to cry and not to feel but I can't. She's so broken. So very broken. I can't take it, it is too much.
<br />Tonight, I realized how much I truly missed my sister. As she held me close after another explosive encounter with us it hurt. My heart feels like it broke. Shattered into a million pieces and now I am left trying to heal it and put it back. She's right when she says nothing will ever be the same. How could it? Does she even realize how much it hurts us to see her hurting herself? Tohear her talking about not knowing if we're real? To be afraid to touch us and make us disappear? 
<br />I keep coming back to that pain. The look on her face as I touched her, told her I was real. Let her know I was there. She flinched away like I do. She hates herself for not being the perfect role model for me. She warns me not to follow her footsteps. She cries, saying I've got so much, like she had. That she looks up to me. That she wants to protect me like always. 
<br />And I can't take it.
<br />You must think me a coward, sitting here and pouring my guts while I cry pitifully, trying to hold it in. It's so hard. So very hard. I feel horrible. Lower tan dirt. I feel it I my fault. I did this. I didn't call because I was and AM a coward. I was afraid of Don. Just his voice. I am a freaking coward! I hate it. I hate this so much! Sometimes I wonder, is there anything else other than pain?
<br />I'm going to call her or write her. Every day. No matter what. Tonight I realize what has been bothering me. The only thing that I can't stop crying about, and that's the loss of my sister. She's more than that to me. She's like my best friend.
<br />And she misses me to. Her whole room is full of pictures I've drawn for her or pictures taken of us or me. She misses me. And I'm the only thing keeping her going she says. That one stupid poem I wrote her when we had to go to counseling together? She reads it every single night and every single morning. I'm all keeping her going, and I am a coward. 
<br />I guess nothing can describe the way I feel right now. The way my heart is grieving. This horrible, horrible pain. It hinders me even now. I feel empty. 
<br />My heart continues to break every time I think about how she left. What she said. How she held me. I can still feel her warm embrace upon me. I miss her. I miss my sister so much. I've been denying it up until now. Is my own freedom from the wretched place worth the loss of my sister? No. No it's not. I miss her to much. 
<br />I feel weak, even if it is only human nature to grieve like this. I wish someone would wake me up. I miss Angela. I want to scream. I want this pain to go away. I want my sister more than anything in the world.
