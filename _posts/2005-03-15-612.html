I hate it when Blogger doesn't post.<br /><br />I wrote a post last night and it didn't post. In the future, I propose to myself that I get my own host. Maybe, with an original url. Oh, sweet dreams.<br /><br />Talking about dreams, last night I had a dream of the end of the world. But, it wasn't typical "end of the world" type stuff. First of all, it was a cold snowy winter. Second of all, there wasn't any mass looting. Third of all, it was a VERY realistic dream. I distinctly remember checking the "CNN" website to see when the doomsday meteor would land. It was pretty variant depending on when you checked. It was generally around 6:30 p.m. , but the "Chicago Tribune" said that it would land at 5 p.m. That kind of left me guessing. That's the true fear of it all. I didn't know when I would be blown to pieces. I started thinking about life and what would happen after I died. You know, being non-religious and all, I was thinking of just a black abyss of nothingness. Just non-existance. But all of my memories are of existance. It's impossible to feel non-existance, because you wouldn't feel anything. Perhaps that's why religion is so prevalent in current culture. All I know is that I knew I was going to die then, and when I woke up... I was very happy. A swelling, undescribable relief poured into my system. Just pure relief. I'm so glad it was another Tuesday today. Same old Chicken Noodle soup at lunch. Same old Andrew and Ryan. Same insane lunatic flute player. Same stupid OLC videos. That was pure bliss for me the first time in my life today. I hope I don't have one of those dreams again. I'm afraid that I'll get stuck in one, and really die. When it's that realistic, what's the difference between reality and non-reality? I felt, heard, smelled, and touched the apockalypse as if it were real. It could have been real. It makes me cringe.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm gonig to talk about how much I hate OLC and "gamers" tomorow (I still can't spell) so stay "tuned".
