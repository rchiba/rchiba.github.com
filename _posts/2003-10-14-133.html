Hello everyone,
<br />I have updated, SO GO TO MY HOMEPAGE!! Anyways, I sent a picture of me in my cow costume to Mr. Rice and it is really cool. I should take another picture somewhere, but I don't know where. It looks like the spammers ran away to their mommies so Justin and I's mission was succesful. Yaay! Anyways, Justin is out cold for a week, which really does stink. I hope we dont have much homework this week, for his sake. Uhhh... I updated my opinions page also so go there. Wow, i sure can type fast. I can type about this whole thing for 5 minuites. Sooooo, I'll write more later when I have strong emotions to motivate me, wait, let me think of what I was talking about at lunch. Oh yea, miles hunley. He deserves, you probably dont want to know what he deserves, but thats the quality of intellect at East Tipp I guess. That is my hypothesis today... "Intellectualy Quality of Humans at Public School Institutions Has Hit an All Time Low" Thats what youll be seeing in the newspaper someday.
<br />/.
