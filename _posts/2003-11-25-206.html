Gah! I haven't updated in, like, a kabillion years! I feel so guilty.... The guilt is slowly building, ya know. Today was an lethargic day. I had a nice chat with Ms. Sunny, she thinks I'm smart. She knows no one my age who knows or even uses 'rhetorical'! Lol! I find that funny for some strange, peculiar reason. Anyways, the talent show try outs were yesterday, it wasn't so bad, I think Ms. Pollard was kinda creepy...but that's just me. I'm typing my group's constitution. Our country's name is Pumpkin! LOL! I'm having... fun. 
<br />Anyways, today I got to explain to Sunny why I only hate one person and plan to keep it that way. That person is a liar, a dirty, rotten, $%&#*@^@^@%#!!!!!!! I hate him I hate him I hate him! But, everything else? I just dislike. Like Kris Ping. She is just a hair's breath away from my hatred. She should be terrified. I talk to Ryo. He's good at torture tactics. anything else besides that are dislikes, mild dislikes, slight dislikes. Kris pin is abou the only strong, strong, STRONG dislike. 
<br />One thing I dislike is others who criticism others. For one, the other day a person, who shall not be named, started complaining about the cafeteria food and how stupid or awful it was. I interjected into this nameless person's sentence and was angered. I'd like to see them do better! So that is exactly what I told them. When you can do better, you can complain. So as soon as you cook really, really, really good food for over 400 people, then you can talk. Until then, shut up and remain silent about it. That is what I'm going to tell anyone and everyone of those nameless criticism. I try not to criticize, and I try and correct myself if and when I do. Critisizing others is what causes high school shootings. You tease one person too much and BOOM! They snap, with every good reason too. It is always fun picking on someone until that someone is you. Then, it isn't so funny now is it? I learned that particular lesson the hard way. Some of you who think you're better than others have no idea what it is to struggle through life at a young age. You have your fun, but later on down the road I'm going to grin as you are stuck in your own filth, and you are all alone. Yes, you may have the advantage of money, but that is becuase of your parents. Thusly, this is why I deplore not trying hard in school, in doing drugs, alcohol, and overall? Not giving a flying feck (yes that was intentional)about where you'll be. Of course, who cares? You come to me for answers but if you don't like the truth or the answer I give, you don't listen. Go on listening to only what the freak you want to hear, just please don't ask me anymore, it's aggrivating.
