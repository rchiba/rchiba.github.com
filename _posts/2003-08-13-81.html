Hello, I am back online.
<br />Ready to get to anything in the world, like my blog. I just finished alot of homework, almost three hours worth. I feel happy;) Anyways, my first full day of school was good, but it was boring. Mostly because it was rules rules rules and yada yada yada.
<br />Same thing that I have had to listen to every year since I moved here. Oh yea, I have a secret weapon in math class! I finished the bonus problem;) YAaaay! All I need is a book cover and I'm all covered for math. Get it? all covered? haha. Sorry for the corny joke. I apologize for any brain damage that caused. Oh yea, I think I am a complete loser in my neighboorhood. I base this because no one wants to sit on the bus with me even though they have to sit in crowded seats. I guess I am a loser geek! LOSER GEEKS UNITE!!!! I've always wanted a loser geek club. I know plenty of people to invite... hardy har har;) I dont know what else to talk about besides being a loser geek. And eating that food at the cafeteria that clogs arteries. I mean, are corn dogs nutritious??? I dont think so!!!! It's an outrage I tell you, AN OUTRAGE!!!!
<br />
<br />I think all the teachers are going to launch an all out assault on me. They are probably shoot me with homework and bomb me with pointless projects, mine me with books and mortar me with lectures. I am prepared though. Even if they can penetrate my defences I shall conquer all!!! MUhahhahahHAHAHAHH!!!!!!!
