New hardware just came into the house and turned tonight into a "stay-up-late-and-read-a-thick-manual" night.<br /><br />As for daily events, I went to the Kumon Center to help out little kids with their math and reading today. I tried to explain standard equations of a line to a girl, but I ended up confusing the kid even more. Who knew that slopes and y-intercepts could be so hard? But, then again, it would be hard for me too if I was in elementary school. Most of my four hours were spent grading piles of worksheets. Kindergarten reading worksheets were the hardest, because I didn't know what to grade on. The kindergarteners had to write words out. Of course, the handwriting was jumbled, but I wasn't sure if I was to grade it based on if the word was spelled correctly, the letters were formed correctly, or if the kid used right word in the blank. Or even a combination of the three. Throw in a natural bias to favor the kid (I sympathize with educational struggles of little children, as I had plenty as well), and things start to get even more chaotic.<br /><br />Things were better than I thought they would be though. The older elementary, younger middle school kids I could communicate with easily. The younger bunches of kids still hate me though. I swear, there was one kid, I believe his name was Elliot, and he would just look at me and scowl. I figured that he was frustrated with doing math for thirty minutes each day (he's in second grade, I would be furious if I had to work that hard in second grade). Perhaps the only person he felt that he could take his agression out on was me. It sure did seem to me that he hated me though. I hope Elliot gets better at math so he can stop being so darned pissed off constantly. <br /><br />The next scheduled volunteer date is on Thursday. Everything important seems to always fall on a Thursday. Isn't this odd?
