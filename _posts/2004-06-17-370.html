Average Yo reporting...
<br />Swimming in the morning, swimming in the evening, swimming at supper time... if swiming was on a bagel, you can... Never mind.
<br />
<br />I've swam too much today. Once in summer gym, and once in the neighboorhood pool. Guess what? I swim tomorow too! I ran 9 laps in 25 minutes. A NEW RECORD, for me at least. That's 2.25 miles in 25 minutes. Wow. Also, my blogs 1th year annevirsary is comming up. Maybe I should celebrate or update the user interface of my site... or not. It depends on how much time I have and how willing I am to learn how to code new things. I really am bad at coding things, sadly.
<br />
<br />Ryan is making a blog... it's funny. I wonder how long it will last? Maybe 1 week? Or maybe 4 days. Most likely 4 days. I can't wait until the weekend so I have time to do things nerdy. 
<br />
<br />I was at the neighboorhood pool and these high school/colledge kids came up to Ryan and I in the spa. I said we were nerds and Ryan said to speak for myself. I found that humerous. Anyways, It's 9:12PM and I must go to sleep.
