I finally realized that my buttons sucked, so I changed them to simple text links. I figured I was missing something, so I added a "badge" of my 5 most recent flickr pictures. I have plans to maybe add a list of frequently used applications to a chunk of the sidebar. I got rid of the "suscribe to this blog" button since it was a constant and depressing reminder that no one actually takes the time to push one button to suscribe to this blog. Moved the archives down a notch, since I figured that the people who come here are at least up to date within the 20 post buffer. People like pictures. My apologies go to those minority of dial-up users who are forced to look at pathetic pictures of myself assembling a desk.<br /><br />Tomorrow I go to an anime convention in Chicago. Some people at school believe that I'm really into Japanese animation. Not as "into" it as one would expect. Sure, I think it's enjoyable to watch, but I'm not interested in the genre of entertainment nearly enough to remember names of directors or voice actors. Sometimes not even characters. I'm just going to the convention to see something new. Maybe take a few pictures. Make a few mental notes. Gain valuable "con" experience. The works. Everything except buy overpriced anime merchandise.<br /><br />I heard a radio commercial while working at the pool a few days ago. It was advertising for "Faith Christian School" or something of that sort. A woman's voice says,<br /><br />"I want them to grow up with wholesome principles..."<br /><br />Later in the commercial, "respect to authority" is mentioned as a chief of these wholesome principles.<br /><br />I find humor in the fact that good, "Godly children" are trained to respect authority so adamantly. <br /><br />I think that an important part of becoming an adult is to learn how to question and challenge authority. I agree wholeheartedly that respecting authority is well and dandy in many situations, but the act of challenging authority has brought about many positive changes in the past. I'm sure there'll be many positive changes in the future as well. <br /><br />I guess if we all went to this fancy religious school, then we would truly become Godly children, and in the end would become completely and utterly obedient to those who claim to be above us. <br /><br />Could we ever incite something to the scale of the American Revolution? Never, but we could always go to church and pray that our oppressors will be more benevolent tomorrow. Could we ever incite something to the scale of the Civil Rights Movement? Of course not, but we could always go to church and pray the prejudice and injustice away.<br /><br />We could then all become genuinely Godly children. And wouldn't that be just swell.<br /><br />
