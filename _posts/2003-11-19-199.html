Ok, this day is good/bad.
<br />I just got my progress report (Midterm) and I have a B+ in PE!!!!! WHAT DID I DO WRONG? What? Am I not good enough? I guess not... Now I can't make it into the A honor roll. A depressing moment for me, especially after how hard I tried everyday at gym. I HATE EVERYONE NOW! Exccept... I don't know....
<br />
<br />Anyways, as I got out of the school, I noticed a pecular smell. The smell of diesel fuel and factory fumes makes a very unpleasant aroma. Polution is everywhere, but what can I do about it?
<br />
<br />Anyways, I really need to get good grades, of else, gooey kablooey for me!
