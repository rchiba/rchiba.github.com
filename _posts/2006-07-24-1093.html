The last day of my volunteer work was supposed to be significant. I guess it wasn't meant to be so. As I walked out of the Kumon center today, the day couldn't be any more ordinary. And to think, the only thing I have to show for all of that volunteerism is a signature and half a rum-raisin cake in my refrigerator. But, what am I talking about? Volunteering is about getting nothing out of doing something. I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to contribute to the <strike>future tyrants of the world</strike> local community.<br /><br />I almost hit a passing car when I was backing out of the parking lot and stepped on the accel pedal instead of the brake. Luckily, the car was moving fast enough to miss my van by inches. That used up most of my good karma (that I've been building up for awhile now), so I have to be extra careful. There won't be any more good karma to bail me out of dire situations. Vigilance! And the need to do good deeds. <br /><br />All this superstitious babble, and I thought I was a skeptic. This whole karma thing is fun though. It's a great way to justify going out of the way to do simple, selfless things. And the false security isn't bad either.<br /><br />*slaps self across face*<br /><br /><i>What am saying?</i> <b>In this egocentric society of faithful redemption and lack of individual responsibility, I am clearly delusional.</b><br /><br />My eyes hurt.<br /><br />
