I'm sorry I haven't updated as of late. I have been too bogged down with work to get on the computer much, let alone you, blog-thing! My Japanese studies have been making me very happy (I know, that sounds so nerdy... Gosh I can't stand that stereotype...)and my other studies have made me wither fusterated or completely and utterly bored.
<br />English is so monotonous, I wish I were in Honors, but they somehow said I refused...Which I didn't. Grr, argh, and argh again. They're reading Shakespeare and I'm stuck with the most monotonous and lethargic and overly descriptive book of the all <em>'Great Expectations'</em>. I feel I should die if I were to be forced to read such a mundane things one more.
<br />Biology would be interesting if he could actually control the class and teach. Finally we get into a form of genetics (my interest) and he can barely get a word in with Ms. Jabberjaw herself Whitney screeching along with Ms. Perfection Hope. I can't stand that class sometimes, it's full of morons! How hard is it to get that a haploid cell is represented by (n) and a diploid cell is represented by (2n)? Honestly, these people are pathetic wastes of protoplasm!
<br />Then there is art, which with its crazy deadlines has been stressing me out most indefinitely. The teacher herself isn't oo bad...If you push past the fact that she has the most annoying habit of drawing on your works when she comments and seems to like stealing pencils. Sometimes, I realize the pencil theft is by accident.
<br />Then there is math, and I believe the teacher to be....Well, to put it bluntly; a bad teacher. The way he conveys the information required isn't always so clear, and his notes are sometimes very unclear. He can't control the class very much, so it's sometimes hard to accomplish our work. It has definitely stressed me out a lot...
<br />World History is OK, Mr. Martin is actually a very good teacher. He actually seems to acknowledge that I understand things much easier. He treats me as though I were on his level (which I assure you I most likely am not) and that makes me not resent a class most treat with adversion.
<br />I'm not complaining, but I can't help but feel stressed out I guess. I jog over ten miles a week, do over sit ups and push ups every other day, and lift weights on the days I don't work my abs. I guess I'm just tired, and with my mom getting stressed as well, I know it is only a matter of time before we get into another argument.
<br />Hopefully getting back on the blogger track;
<br />~Amanda
