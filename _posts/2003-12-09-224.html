I didn't die, but I did take Sunny's advice. Not to mention 'It' was late, and I only had 30 minutes instead of an hour, thank goodness! Anyways, all I did was drone him out and drew and drew and yes, I drew. It wasn't easy, and my head was pounding afterwards. Maybe Ryo's little pep talk helped? Lol, I don't know, but I don't have to see him until next year!
