I went to Summer Gym, and they took us on a "field trip" to International Sports Center ( a local gym ). They gave us a tour and let us try some stuff out. At the end of our trip they gave us promotional handouts encouraging us to come back. I hate "field trips" like these because it just makes me sad that the school doesn't have enough money (or isn't willing to pay the money) to let us go on an educational field trip. They give us a promotional crap commercialized field trip which is really just a long commercial on how International Sports Center is superior to other health clubs. I really want to protest or something, because something is wrong when public schools have to sell their kids out to some crap health club for no reason. 
<br />
<br />Then theirs this other incident on the bus. I sat next to this kid who was talking about his guns. He was trying to impress these girls or something. He was talking about how he regularly kills dogs and cats with machine guns and pipe bombs, and talks about how he wants to kill people next. I don't see how this is supposed to impress anybody. Do you? I mean this kid is a trailer trash kid, living in the woods with his extended family, with a ton of fire arms, and with obligation to do inhmane acts. Are you supposed to brag about such things? I hate people like him because he can get welfare, social security, and pension plans. How come people like him are citizens and I am not? I will be 20 times as productive as he will in a lifetime. That idiot kid. He bragged about this incident where he stuck a pipe bomb in a dogs mouth and lit it. The dog exploded, decapitated, dead. How could someone tolerate such behavior. He is more likely to be a terrorist than some middle eastern guy. Why don't they start biasing their security checks with the following guidelines:
<br />Observe people for terrorist activities if they are:
<br />1.White 
<br />2.13-18 years old
<br />3.Live in the woods
<br />4.Likes to decapitate dogs with fire arms
<br />5.Considers firearms a bragging right
<br />6.Can't pronounce aquire
<br />
<br />How many people brag about killing things, possessing machine guns, and smoking? I hate him and I want to catch him like a rat. Let's see what happens when you shoot him with a machine gun. Let's see how fun it is for him to taste a pipebomb. 
<br />
<br />Let's see him in jail.
