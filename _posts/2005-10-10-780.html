Andrew told me that he was having a bad day today, so I threw him against the wall.<br /><br />While the action seemed only slightly hostile at the time, it was not at all. I don't like it when people have bad days and complain about it. <br /><br />I have to admit, I do so constantly. It's one of those things I could never teach, because I set such a terrible example. I'm the pinnacle of complaining. I complain almost every day. Even now, I type up complaints on here every night. Complaints for every occasion seem to pop up everywhere.<br /><br />The thing is, complaining about something does absolutely nothing to improve the situation at hand. Complaining about homework isn't going to get it done. Complaining about how Indiana is boring isn't going to make Indiana any more interesting. Complaining about how your grandma uses your toothbrush to clean her dentures is not going to keep your grandma from using your toothbrush to clean her dentures.<br /><br />People like me, Andrew, and a number of other folks should get a grip on life. There isn't anything worth complaining. So, we shouldn't.
