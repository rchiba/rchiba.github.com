The robot is finally done. In the crate, ready to be driven away. My second build season is finished. <br /><br />I find it stunning how quickly this mid-winter time period goes. Twirling a pencil around, I wonder if swimmers, or football players, or basketball players get the same feeling when they're playing their sport. <br /><br />I can tell you that diving felt like an eternal bucket of pain. Or rather, it was an eternal bucket of pain.<br /><br />Time to rest? Is it really that time again?<br /><br />I feel anxious when I'm around the tech team now. I can tell that I'm not part of "them" anymore. I guess the Fetted Inner Core has abandoned me. I don't blame them. I haven't been to any of their all-night sessions, I haven't put a single bolt into the bot. Doing all the computer work is fun, but now I feel distant, pointless, stupid. It's easy to get depressed about not having a real role on the team. It's why people quit day jobs to become beggars, or start up communes in the forest. It's why people jump off of buildings, and it's why people dedicate themselves to other people. Everybody must have a role.  <br /><br />Do I have a role?
