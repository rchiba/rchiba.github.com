Another diving meet, another day...
<br />
<br />Ryan smacked his hand on the diving board while doing a twister. A minor flesh wound (a scratched patch of skin) was caused, but it messed him up. Now, he's not so very happy because he didn't do so well and also because everyone is feeling sorry for him.
<br />
<br />Feeling sorry for people isn't going to help them. It is going to be your first instinct if you're talking to someone who has come about lesser luck. If you feel sorry for a disabled person, you are just casting them below you. You are just saying that they are of a lesser "value" than you are. You are feeling sorry for them as if you feel sorry for an underling, or a subordinate. You may have good intentions, but having these kind of feelings toward people isn't going to solve their problems. Look at them as an equal individual, not a subordinate. Focus on what you cause and the after effects of whatever you do. Now, that's something to think about.
<br />
<br />Anyways, about people and after effects of what they do, I brought my briefcase to school today. I brought it to lunch, since my locker is a finite space and I had a more or less infinite ammount of stuff I had to fit inside of it. I left it on top of the table I usually sit on and ate lunch. Afterwards, I got up to throw away my trash. As I left, my "friends" grabbed my briefcase and started trying to open it. Luckily, my briefcase is double locked. Unfortunately, those "friends" I was talking about were illogical enough to try to open my briefcase by force. When I returned, I found my briefcase bruised and one of the locks stuck in its position. Luckily, Ryan was able the fix it (Amazing isn't he?) but now the lock makes an annoying clicking sound that isn't supposed to be made and the sides of the case are scratched, lowering its resale value. Obviously, my "friends" aren't really friends. My "friends" are just backstabbing, good for nothing, insignificant pricks. Time to choose another table...
<br />
<br />What table should I sit at? Obviously, most tables will reject me for who I am. I am a anti-social type of person if you have just met me. Hopefully, Devin's table will be nice enough to encorporate me into their social structure. It really annoys me that this whole world is full of idiotic pricks. Why have I been sitting with them if they are disrespectful enough to try to break into my locked things and break them? Why have I been sitting with people?
<br />
<br />Logically, I would enjoy sitting with robots. I mean, an efficient conversation consisting of the latest news, Internet statistics, and calculus lessons seems enjoyable with a nice steaming styrofoam bowl of chili. Maybe I should stop eating lunch. Or... 
<br />
<br />I could make my own colony in the corner of the Cafeteria. I mean, with this whole social caste system already in place, a little revolution wouldn't be so bad. Social reform anyone?
<br />
<br />Good night.
