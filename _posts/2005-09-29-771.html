I have rediscovered the joys of bittorrenting.<br /><br />Thank's to Ryan for bringing back the inner force that has pushed me to download a new client, and get my torrenting up and running. I've got quite a few soundtracks downloading right now, and more will be downloaded tomorrow. I need a larger music collection. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the most capable computer for all of this is unstable, as it often crashes. I should start bit torrenting on my laptop. It makes a bit of sense. I mean, my laptop is as stable as you can get. Windows ME is shaky, but this platform is as clean as a tack, or at least I hope it is. I'm not sure what's lurking around in my dusty 5 year old N5130 Pavilion right now, but I'm sure that people aren't targeting systems like these anymore.<br /><br />Time to find a client, and to clean up my hard drive. Isn't it odd that it's only 4 gigabytes? I'm glad it still runs though. I love my old laptop. Trusty, always by my side. I think my laptop is even older than my dog.
