Today was as average and frustrating, yet happy as a day can get. 
<br />Here is what caused these moods.
<br />
<br />Average:Boring math asignment, oh yea got invited to happy graph stamp club;also, heard rumors about me again
<br />
<br />Frustrating:Frustrating math asignment; stress uncontrollable; read sad tale about retarded man(Flowers for Algernon);cutters, once again
<br />
<br />Happy:Happy math asignment; Ryan finnally taking soup fairy stuff off site; people starting to shut up in comm (not that much)
<br />
<br />Thats what has caused these emotions. Now, onto the rumors, apperently there is a little spying prick in the building. ***coughmelindacough*** She blats out anything I say in comm. She read my website and it had the word kill in it, so she immeadiately told Tony and who knows who else. I have all these rumors about me spreading about like wildfire, or maybe I am exaggerating. Oh yea, hey you government people spying on my site! Yea you! I don't mean kill by homicide. It's a figure of speech ok?? So don't send me to an insane aslym or something! Ok, what else is there to talk about. Oh yea, I still hate those cutters, cutting pricks, always disturbing the tidyness of the line, only to mess it up into a primitive blob. Hey ryan, I fixed the link and I found out what the problem was! Put html:// in your link thingie ok? Also, I installed a new Yo's Headlines at the bottom of the page if you didn't notice. Check it out! Oh yea, vote in my polls because I will put a new one up soon. Well, this is The Average Yo signing out/
<br />;)
