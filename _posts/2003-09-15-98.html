Hey, it's me again and you all know why I didn't update over the weekend so I'm not gonna tell you.  Anyway, like Ryo said, ISTEP tests started today.  They're so BORING!  I HATE them!  Especially the essay parts.  I mean, what's the point of making someone write something they don't want to.  IT'S POINTLESS!!!  It's a free country, right?  Seaking of free, did you ever wonder why the call the US a free country when it cost so much to live?  That really gets on my nerves.  SO MUCH MONEY!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  Well, I better go gather my thoughts for a little bit.  Seeya ;)
