Cloud-speckled, sunny, 60 degree weather dominated today. Now there's a lightning storm outside of my window that's comforting me with dull rumbles and bright flashes. Thunder and lightning have always comforted me, as with rain. Darkness is commonly associated with sorrow, and for good reason too, but I find darkness soothing. A power to balance the harsh, artificial light that fills most of my life. Nature is dark, Earth is dark, life is dark. I want to run out of the door and embrace the darkness. But I'm not going to. Death is dark too.<br /><br />Running. Some people like to. Others can't due to excessive lipid reserves attached to their bodies. Personally, I'll run if running suits my fancy at any given moment. I would gladly run out of my English or Health class, but running to lunch is, to me, absurd. This morning, I ran down a small hallway in my house, a tile hallway. <br /><br />Ran too fast.<br /><br />Slid.<br /><br />Hit the wall.<br /><br />An hour later, I do the same thing. Hitting the wall hurts, but for some idiotic reason, I've come to enjoy it. Who knows why. Everything from the scritchy noises my socks make as I fly down the tile, to the dull thump of my body impacting the wall, to the stinging pain blistering down my shoulder are oddly satisfying. <br /><br />I'll have to add that activity to my list of hobbies.<br /><br />I'm trying to brainwash myself into looking forward to tomorrow. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the fact that tomorrow is a Monday makes this task overwhelmingly difficult.
