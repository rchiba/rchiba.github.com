No time at all, but I felt like posting. I usually don't have time for much entertainment, so this is my only entertainment. Just like in the old days, eh? Well, I'm ripping some smooth jazz. It's really nice stuff. I've got a lot of quiz bowl to study, and I don't have much time to study all of that stuff. I really want to though. Maybe tomorow. My printer is not functioning so I emailed my teacher about my situation and attached my homework to the email in .rtf format. Hopefully it'll work. I have so much going on this meager post is what helps me get to the end of the day. Just to post. Living to blog... sounds like me... nerd extrordanaire.
