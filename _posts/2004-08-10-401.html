Hey blog-thing! I'm so sorry I haven't updated, in, like, forever! @_@ My life has been so hectic. My little sister has been here a lot, my story is progressing, and so is my exercise program (Which has stopped for a couple of days because I went on vacation, we went to the Zoo, lol) But, anyway, I'm just about to go record what I weigh, I'm crossing my fingers! Anyway, my arms are hurting because stupid my over did her workout last night. Oh, the pain.... But oh well! It serves me right, doesn't it? I can't wait until school starts, and I can't wait until next weekend either. I am one of the lucky few to get interviewed to receive a grant/scholarship for collage! I'm so happy! We will definitely need the help, and I really, really want at least my Master's degree! I always have, ever since I was little.
<br />Anyway, I have to go, see ya later Blog-thing, and Ryo? I hope you had fun on vacation!
<br />~Amanda
