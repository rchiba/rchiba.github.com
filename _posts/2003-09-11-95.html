Today, I have no homework.
<br />I have to go to the gym though, unfortunately. I am waiting for my dad to come back. Today, many people said I was mean. I was probably mean because the day has been mean on me. I got all these bad grades. ESPECCIALLY in science. I need to be "more complete" as my teacher said. I dont know what to be "more complete" on!!!! I DONT KNOW!!!! What should I write then... oh yea, today is the memorial of Sept. 11. Lets all give our grief to all those poor souls who lost their lives on that day.(If I dont say that, the FBI will snipe me)OK, i'm safe now. Lets go home
