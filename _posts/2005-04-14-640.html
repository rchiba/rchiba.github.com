Yup yup...<br /><br />I've started drawing incarnations of myself now. I don't know, but I always portray myself as some violent freak in a poorly drawn trenchcoat. And, unfortunately, I can only draw uzis so I'm equipted with two bland uzis. Too bad I can't draw lugers. <br /><br />Anyways, I suppose it started when Rachel was talking about robbing banks with me. I started daydreaming (Which I do alot of) and made up this little image of myself in a trench coat. he he. I must be mentally ill.<br /><br />My friend, Kaiser Andrew, has a knack for throwing pencils at me. It's disturbing to know that he is out to get me. I have to watch my back incessantly now. In the bathroom, in the living room, while I'm digging through the system files on my computer. I have to make sure Andrew is not behind me, waiting to throw a pencil at me. I must be cautious at ALL times. He is out to get me.<br /><br />I suck at drawing.
