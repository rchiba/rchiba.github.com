I still feel like musty car fabric and old cheese puffs.<br /><br />The twelve hour drive from "down there" (Alabama) to "up here" (Indiana) has tired me. Thus, I will soon skitter to bed and doze off.<br /><br />In other news, I have found that several people have been commenting, and I like it when people do it! Although sometimes I consider this site and the text associated with it to be very private, I enjoy getting feedback (mostly encouragement to keep myself from jumping off a cliff after writing some of my "sob-story feel sorry for me" posts).<br /><br />I hate cheese puffs. I don't know why I ate them while traveling in the car. They make one's mouth dry and numb with overly salty, artificial "cheese" powder. But, one look at the cheetah touting the "xtremely cheesyness" of the stuff gets me hooked. <br /><br />What can I say, I'm easily swayed by packaging.
