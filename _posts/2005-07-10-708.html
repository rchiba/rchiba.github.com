One of the main household computers are being sluggish. Very frustratingly, excruciatingly sluggish. Every minute or so, it freezes for about fifteen seconds and makes a grinding type noise. Not very reassuring. I'm still not sure if it's a hardware problem or a software problem. Nevertheless, I'll keep trying to tinker my way out of this mess.<br /><br />I listened to a lecture on television today about "Utilitarian" and "Hippocratic" and "MultiAxial" philosophies pertaining to medical practices today. Do the ends justify the means, or do the rules overpower all outcomes? A question asked by ethics committees all over the world.<br /><br />Russian scientists always fascinated me. It's almost sort of a romanticism of Russian science. Their stereotypical gruff voices and idealistic views inspire me. Before the collapse of the USSR, and communism, scientists worked for the advancement of science. The common knowledge gained from scientific advancement was what pushed these researchers to work so hard. After the fall of communism, researchers now had to think of ways to market and sell their scientific data, or knowledge. Advancing science does not matter in a capitalistic society if it doesn't make money. Cash cows are the name of the game, and it's ruining how technological advancement should be run. People should work for humanity, not for personal wealth and indulgence. If it's one thing Soviet Russia could do well, it would be innovation. <br /><br />Like I can make these judgments. I hardly know anything about the subject. Yet, I continue to romanticize Russian scientists. It's like worshiping some obscure music celebrity. Do you really "know" them? Can you really "know" anyone?<br /><br />No, so that's why we should all be paranoid and live in little underground caves, growing mushrooms for subsistence.
