Ok, amanda, I understand.
<br />Anyways, today was normal.  I have various tests and such. All is a blur. I am talking to Amanda. My life is so average, I am so blessed.
<br />Anyways, there is nothing to talk about because I have the memory span of 5 hours
<br />I don't remember anything that happened today, besides the usual moronicness of East Tipp Middle School.
<br />This school is for rejects!
