Today was flimsy... is that even an adjective proper for the description of a day?
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />Today, Devin and John's cutting has infuriated me to the point of.... Point of anger, I guess. I am going to catch him. And I need some hard proof. My plan? Well, I plan to get my camera, bring it to the restroom. I will hide behind a wall. Well trafficked, but out of site from the line. I will take pictures with my camera of the line every... say 2 minuites. From these pictures, I will create a list of people in line, in order. When John and Devin come into the bathroom I will take pictures of them. When they go out of the bathroom I will take pictures of them. Using the list of names in line, and the pictures, I can then PROVE that Devin and John are cutting. Now, the hard part? not getting caught with my camera while loitering near the wall next to the bathroom. Teacher sentries are out there, but I'm helping them. I just don't have authorization from the powers that be. I'm going to catch those crooks! Let's just hope they cut again tomorow, and then we'll see who speaks last.

<br />Anyways, Devin has been threatening me with a needle for the past week. Today I took it away from him and threw it in the trash. It was illegal anyways. No weapons at school, remember Devin? Showed him who's boss. He's coming over to my house on Monday to help with the commercial. Our project is well on it's way to be finished. We are almost done! It is easier than I thought. Also what I can't believe is how fast the year's been. The years almost ended. And when July comes along, it'll be this site's 1st birth day! That will be a magnificent day indeed. Let's just hope this blog doesn't die. I must keep recording as long as I can. Bye;)
