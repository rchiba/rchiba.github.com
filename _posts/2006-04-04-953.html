Nine hours of non-school work time. Nine hours spent like this:<br /><ul><li>Three hours half-asleep, writhing on an old couch.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Three hours doing homework, mostly chemistry.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>One and a half hours drawing something out.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Half an hour eating, lunch and dinner.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Half an hour brushing my teeth and figuring out that my mouthwash has hydrogen peroxide as its second ingredient besides water.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Half an hour typing this post out.</li></ul><br /><br />So there's my day in a nutshell. My days are much like this every day, except more time is spent doing homework and less time spent sleeping. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, as I get to do my speech about furry fandom. I can't wait to see how the class reacts to my speech, and speech topic. Something so odd (To me, furry fandom is the oddest thing in the world) and not so ordinary usually isn't met with usual reactions. I'll have to wait until tomorrow to do what I want though, so I'll stop talking about it now, because when I talk about things I want to do but can't, it usually bothers me.<br /><br />Lately, I've caught an illness which I believe is the cold. That's why I <i>tried</i> to sleep so much today, I'm so tired. But, standing in a hot shower for a few minutes has made me feel better, even slightly energetic. Currently, I'm trying to ignore the fact that my room is slowly running out of tissues, and that the supply will be depleted in a matter of hours if I'm not careful about my consumption of such integral devices. As a side note about my health, I got a paper cut on my right ring finger  today when I sat down and a magazine page that was sitting on the couch as well took a slice at my hand.<br /><br />I used to experience much more pain that I currently do when it comes to cuts, impact injuries, and the like. I'm not sure why, but stubbing my toe on a chair leg (which is sadly part of my daily routine) doesn't have the same "OH (insert expletive here)!!!" power. That's a good thing, I guess. Although I wish I didn't have do be so clumsy every morning.<br /><br />My cough drops taste bad so I didn't have any today. I brought four to school, and brought four back. What kind of <b>imbecile</b> comes up with <b>lemon-honey</b> flavored cough drops anyways?<br /><br />
