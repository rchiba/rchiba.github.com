I updated the links. (they look uber cool on IE (internet explorer!) I took away some, added some others. It took 2 hours. Depending on what internet browser you use, you will see different things. If your browser doesn't support DHTML, no change will occur. Anyways, if you don't know what a browser or DHTML is, go learn it!
