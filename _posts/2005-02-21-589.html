I'm listening to "Arockalypse and the Amazing Trans-Metropolitains", and it's really distracting me. It's still odd that this is the kind of music that sticks to me. It never gets old. You're just humming it constantly.<br /><br />Anyways, since diving is over, life is better. Unfortuantly, the debut of this "job shadowing" project in the ill-fated "Orientation to Life and Careers" class (Like I needed someone to teach me how to orient my life, geez). I think that this job shadowing thing is nonsense. I want to be my own person, not to copy some chump off of the street. What's wrong with being individual? <br /><br />Also, I'm thinking of getting a LED ID badge for my birthday or something. Perhaps I could advertise my 1337ness to the world. Those LED badges make me quiver in my nerdness. I want one. I NEED ONE! Not really. If you look at them, you start to ask yourself if you really need one. Do they actually have a functional part in society? No. <br /><br />Good night.
