If today was a name of a book, it would be entitled: <i>Murder and Intrigue in the Case of Missing Robotics Computers</i>.<br /><br />As the failure of the "IT Captain" I am, I tried to do a seemingly simple thing. Find out where the robotics team's computers are. I asked, and I still have not found. All of the people I talked to were peers, so there was much finger pointing at the administration and other adults. I must remember to question them tomorrow. Another thing that cropped up a few times was the discontent and miscommunication among members. Some speculate that the team's existence is at stake. <br /><br />Robotics is an odd beast. It'll wick away your time, drive your head to madness, and get you angry at your peers, frustrated at the issues at hand. At the same time, it continues, as there is always (even if it is a trace) of hope, of residual confidence and resolve to do the things needed to get tasks accomplished. As the season continues, this residual emotion is fluctuating, with more depressions than peaks, and I sometimes fear that everything will fall apart and all the effort invested in robotics will be nullified. <br /><br />I see no future for a group with such resentment and ill will. I hope that there <i>will</i> be a future for the team, and as the older members graduate, this ill will will die away. I want things to work. But, is simply wanting enough?<br /><br />Because robotics has changed me from a nobody to a somebody. When I talk to people on the team, I feel like I'm a person. Like I have the ability to create things, just like everybody else. And when people ask me to do things, I do them, and when I ask other people to do things, they do them as well. It's a very different dynamic than quizbowl, where I'm constantly alienated and confused, sometimes uncomfortably.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, quizbowl is an odd beast too. As I mentioned above, I feel alienated, but only within myself. A few people I know from quizbowl I have a deeper connection to than the people I know from robotics. Hm...<br /><br />NaNoWriMo has begun. I'm not participating. I wish best of luck to those who do.
