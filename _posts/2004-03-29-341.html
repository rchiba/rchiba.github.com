Average Yo reporting...
<br />Sorry I haven't been updating. I was buisy with my movie and Devin. Guess what??? My movie officially has 9MINUTES of content as of now! Anyways, I've been trying to revamp my site with new code, but the pre-generated blog code from Blogger keeps interfereing with my pursuits. It's like trying to figure out which wire to cut on a bomb which has a whole spectrum of colored wires. Anyways...
<br />
<br />Today was the first day of school for a week. I am kind of happy. We get to do "Invention Convention" which is a huge project that I and  2 others get to work on as a group. While everyone was whimpering and sighing I was silently happy. Well, actually not silently. I kind of looked like a dork (According to Devin's dictionary, Dork=Jack*ss, sorry folks, profanity is condemned in this site. If you like profanity, go to some redneck mafia site). Also, I have to cancel my band concert/contest thing because I have to take the ACT's on the same day.
<br />
<br />Speaking of band, we ABSOLUTELY HAVE to turn in$53 to our band teacher tomorow. This will pay for this overnight trip that our school is doing for it's band students. I've been waiting for this for 3 years. Look at my dorkitude, but I don't care. Anyways, I KNOW that about 25% of the students in band will forget and start panicing. I predict! I know it!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I've been downloading this 544MB (Huge isn't it?) program for my computer called project Entropia or something like that. It's like a service provided by this company. It's a bit game-like, like a fantasy MMORPG, but larger and more serious. I'm a bit anxious for it to be done downloading. My internet connection is dial-up so it has been downloading for the past 2 days and as I speak right now. So far, it's got 20 hours to go. Yay! Anyways, I can't download this overnight (My dad gets late night calls) so this download is going to tie up my phone line for the next....say....5 days. Pretty sad isn't it? Downloading a file for 5 days streight. It's taking forever though. I've downloaded 150MB so far, making me about 28% done. Well, it's going to take awhile. And I'm probably going to delete the program anyways, but what the heck!
<br />
<br />That's all I can say. My dad is demanding for me to go to the gym so I have to go tonight. Arggg...Well, the vacation couldn't have lasted any longer anyways...
<br />
<br />Bye;)
