I am absolutely estatic about getting my hands on 3ds Max sometime this month (hopefully this Friday, maybe). I have no clue on what it's UI is like, what the tools available are, if it has intensive hotkey usage, or if it has different terms for the same things used in Blender.<br /><br />I'm assuming that Blender is really easy compared to 3ds, but perhaps I'll be pleasantly surprised (never the case). If anything, playing around with it for a few hours will teach me how to use this tool.<br /><br />Not that I'm getting any stupider or anything, but my typing abilities and conceptual thinking abilities, which make up the bulk of the abilities I need to write beefy posts, is drained. Due to a few hours less sleep every day, I can't think as clearly. My mind is clouded.<br /><br />It is worth noting that I am ashamed of myself for not doing my speech today. I hate it when I plan for things to happen, and they don't. The fact that the peers in my speech class actually volunteer to go is creating problems in my plans. Because they raise their hands, I hesitate to raise my hand. <br /><br />Why?<br /><br />The reason I tell myself is that I don't want to take the opportunity of speaking from someone else in my class.<br /><br />The real reason is that because I was stunned by that fact that I had to compete with other people to do something unpleasant. I guess I'm not as "valiant" a martyr when people are volunteering to go to the gallows, so to speak.<br /><br />I would like to reiterate that my mind is clouded. <br /><br />Because it is.
