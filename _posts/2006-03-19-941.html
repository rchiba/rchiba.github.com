Muddly. If that was a word, it would describe today.<br /><br />I was very angry today. A quiet, brooding anger. An emotion that has no right to be there, no purpose. After all, I really have no reason to be angry at anything. I should be excruciatingly happy from winning at Robotics. <br /><br />I'm presuming that the anger is from all the pent up anger from the past few months. Every lunch period, I'm fuming angry from having to sit next to two mentally retarded children in the class before. I still haven't accepted the fact that I am going to be screamed at for no reason intermittently during that class. It's a very difficult thing to accept. Especially when I reserve that class period for sleeping.<br /><br />The anger also stems from the fact that I'm being pushed around by people for expressing my thoughts on things. In social situations in which the conflict involves me, I often get self-conscious, depressed, and sad rather than angry and enraged. I'm sick of myself hating myself for being involved in such things. I've got to just accept the things that happen to me and the circumstances that surround these events. If someone hates me, if I can't control myself and say what I have to say, but apologize, if people are better than me, more talented, more sophisticated, more athletic, smarter, richer, then I've got to accept it. It's destiny. If I fail, then I do, and it's no use complaining, or trying to make myself feel better by telling other people about it. It's no use because it accomplishes nothing. Things remain where they are. All it results in is wasted time ad energy, as well as an over-inflated ego.<br /><br />But, I know there is a high chance that I'll revert back to my primal urges to gather pity when the situation calls for it. This is rather unfortunate.<br /><br />I hate myself, but hate myself for hating myself, and because of this, hate myself for hating myself for hating myself. Repeat this step for 24 hours and you've got my average day. Fun.
