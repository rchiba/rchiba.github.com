Work hard, play hard.<br /><br />Coming back at around midnight for the past two days has been worth stepping out of my stuffy room and enjoying my life. My after school, weekend life has changed significantly since last year. There's a constant supply of time periods in which it is ok to forget about homework, grades, and tests. And this distinct newness in my way of life, the slow deterioration of a boring routine, is something I treasure. Because, I don't know how long this'll last. When build season rolls around, or if another change comes about, what'll happen to this off-time?<br /><br />The <i>finishing-homework-on-sunday</i> deal, which is entirely new to me, worries me a little bit. After all this relaxing, it's dangerous to start expecting myself to promptly finish my work.<br /><br />It's hard to write when there's no story to tell.
