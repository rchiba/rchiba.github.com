Hello bloggie!
<br />This is the Average Yo reporting in on today's status.
<br />Today's status was very normal. In PE we have to do this dancing thing called "barn dancing". It involves the males putting their hands on the females hips and dancing around to fast music. We had to pick partners and it was a bit unnerving, being the nervous male I am. I just hoped my hands wouldn't slip. Anyways, today was normal and normal it was. I can't believe for once I didn't get angry or bored or sad or weird feelings. But, there were some things I was thinking of. Anyways, in social studies, whenever someone says that "I like school", everyone (especially some CERTAIN people that I can't mention anymore because they will nag on me) accuse the person of likeing school. They discourage (I mean, really really discourage) the learning system and school in general. It is a sad way of being cool, but it just gets me farther in life than everyone else! 
<br />
<br />Nothing really happened today, so I guess that wraps it up.
