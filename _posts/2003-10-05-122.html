HAHAHA, I just looked at my guestbook.  saw a death threat. You should check it out. It's pretty funny because you know what, im not dissing anybody. hardy har har... doesn't that just make you laugh. I write a page long explanation on how I think i didn't diss anyone and these humans still are stubborn enough to not care. It's pretty funny. Death threats are fun to anylyze when you think about it psycologically. I mean, that obscene language could come from only a few choice people (whom I have the great pleasure to know). It's funny. No offence whoever wrote that. I mean, I don't want to "diss" you. Hey, and if I get killed, you people know who to convict ok? lol
