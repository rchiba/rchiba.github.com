I'm glad to say that I'm typing from a computer that is not chained to the slowness of hard drive-stored data. I'm glad to say that I'm free, at least for now, of waiting for things to load. I'm free!<br /><br />The RAM installation went easily and now I get to open lots of programs and not have to wait to change between them. This is very comforting, and soothing. I'm also glad that crucial.com was nice enough to give me 2nd day priority air mail for free. Ordering something on the weekend and getting it by Wednesday, for free? That's fantastic. I applaud you, Crucial.<br /><br />In other news, I'm starting an initiative to get to sleep faster, and wake up earlier. I believe that this habit will improve my mental status in the mornings, and thus boost my sagging French grade. I theorize that what has been causing my French follies is a combination of my lazy/paranoid studying habits, and my lack of sleep. If I sleep earlier, more sleep will be obtained, and I will be able to function less crazily. That is my plan.<br /><br />But, otherwise...<br /><br />Things are "just working", and I smile to that kind of tune.
