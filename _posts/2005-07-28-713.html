What, it's midnight? Has the fact that I am awake on four hours of sleep over a period of 48 hours startling me? Am I hovering between the world of dreams and the world of reality? The answers to all three of those questions are yes.<br /><br />Basically, I ran errands today. Errands that involved lots of car time. This means that I have lots of time to think, which means later, as in now, I get frustrated because I can't remember what I was thinking about. It's great to type freely, in incomplete blurbs and run-on sentences. I better enjoy it while I can. My English teacher sent me a letter today, ordering me to read the designated summer reading book. School gets closer and I'm still in a summer daze. A daze of stupor, drifting around in a half-awake mental status. Many people continue on to think and act this way for the first few months of school. This results in tedious "review" lessons for half of the year. I don't like it when people take my time away. I don't like "review" lessons. Let those who delay teaching be taught discipline.<br /><br />There's this little girl who lives next to me. Her age is unknown to me, but I assume she is ten or so. Allegedly, she called the emergency telephone number at a local fast food restaurant as a joke, a silly, trivial prank. <br /><br />This prank does not seem very trivial to me. Calling the emergency number costs taxpayers and the government large sums of money to maintain. Tracking equipment, sirens, communications equipment, computer navigation systems, and human effort must be consumed to keep such a system up and running. And this little prick decideds to call the number for fun? It makes me want to just whap out my PVC pipe and start whacking an effigy of this idiotic character. Tearing it to shreds and burning it away in the fireplace. I absolutely detest the consumation of taxpayers' money for such a trivial and completely senseless act. This horrid society. Where are our morals and civic duty going? To prank calling 911 to idiotically covering someone's house in toilet paper, it is evident that the young population of suburban communities are quickly being corrupted. Absolutely horrid. Disgusting. Blech.<br /><br />As my vulgar alternate personality (No, I'm not cursed with MPD) would have said, "WTF!? This MF'er *ssh*le should go to h*ll. G*dd*mn it!"
