Why eat ramen when you're in a startup? Startups are about changing the world, and you simply cannot change the world on an unfulfilled pallate. Not only that, startup culture is all about building things. Taking what little resources we have and creating beautiful things. 

Here are some beautiful noodle recipes that I've come to appreciate that are as quick, but more nutritious and hopefully more enjoyable, than plain instant ramen. Please note that in designing these noodle recipes, I have some important constraints:

1. Recipes must be brain-dead easy and reasonably difficult to screw up.
2. Base ingredients must be easy to find in even a small grocery store
3. All ingredients must be cheap, and total cost must not exceed $4 for 3 servings.
