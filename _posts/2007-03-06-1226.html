I don't know how things go. I'll talk about strife and dark emotions. Grief. <br /><br />You know, it takes a lot of power to box things up. To tie the knots tight enough to not let a single strand creep out. Pull, pull, pulling still. Strands that take hold of rational thinking, rational actions. To box those up, shove them aside for another day. It takes a lot of power. I don't know how people have this incredible grip on their emotions.<br /><br />This afternoon, I walked into a gas station. <br /><br />It was after Quizbowl. Couldn't think of anything except how inferior I was to the world. How incredibly silly it was for me to seem smart. <br /><br />Drove the minivan into the dingy, oily parking lot. Turned the key. Engine murmured and died. Sky was overcast. Nothing very attractive to look at. Propane tanks stared back at me from their cage. They had nothing to say, the blue rhino has nothing to say either.<br /><br />Gas was too expensive. Didn't buy any of that. Couldn't. Not with three dollars. Went in and looked for something to distract me. <br /><br />As I was walking through the aisles, I wondered if anyone would come in to rob the cashier. Wondered if they'd shoot me. Wondered about the girl in the paper a few months ago. They shot her. Why wouldn't they shoot me? With a gun to my head, some random, ultra-violent rubbish of society would take me out. Click, bang. A spectacular bang. Wouldn't it be great?<br /><br />And so I tried to find something. Maybe a cheap drink. To keep the mind off of stupid things like that.  <br /><br />Ninety-nine cents. Energy drink. "Lime-tastic" flavor. Perfect.<br /><br />Bought the thing, walked out. Walked along the cement curb. Soon, the asphalt ended. Tall grass, Wal-Mart plastic bags, trusted metal parts of all sorts. They waved peacefully in the wind. I wish I could be peaceful. I took a sip of Mister Ninety-Nine cents. Cars rumbled on down the gray slab of government-paved goodness. Rust buckets rolling on down. Where?<br /><br />I trotted back to my own rust bucket. Shiny key clacked into place, lights flashed. All systems were now ready. Ready for me. Ready for my foot to push, hands to steer, mind to calculate, to decide if it was safe to change lanes.<br /><br />Pulling out of the parking lot, I took another sip of Mister Cheap Energy Drink. He tasted like gummi bears, the white kind.<br /><br />I didn't care to be killed by anyone anymore.<br /><br />Distraction. It's how I tie up my box.
