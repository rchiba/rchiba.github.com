I have returned from the elusive "amusement" park called Cedar Point, and amazingly, it was fun. I hate high elevations, large crowds, and insane clowns, but I actually enjoyed it. Pretty amazing...
<br />
<br />Anyways, the view from the top of some of those roller coasters was spectacular. You could see for miles. Even though I enjoyed it, there was stress involved. I learned not to go on a log ride on a cold day. I also learned not to go in a haunted house when wanting to go to the bathroom. It was "good" stress, I guess, but it still made me tired. 
<br />
<br />On top of that I went to join Ryan on his halloween escapade. I gave most of my candy to him since I can't stand candy. It overwhelms me. I ate three "fun" sized candy bars and I felt full. I don't understand how people can stand eating all of that candy. It disturbs me. Ryan called me anorexic once. I think the world is messed up when people start calling fit people "anorexic" and overweight people "normal". It's a screwed up world out there, and I live in it.
<br />
<br />While "trick-or-treating" I learned something. I learned that junky cars with teenagers in them will throw fire crackers at you, minivans are good for asking for directions, and jeeps... never mind.
<br />
<br />I practiced for my playing test, but I believe I am a failure, so I stopped. I hope "fate" will be nice to me. I practiced though. Hope is a good feeling.
