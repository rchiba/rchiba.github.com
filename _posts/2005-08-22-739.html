I keep telling myself that homework is fun, and I keep telling myself that English class will be fun today, and I keep telling myself that I'll get through the day, but sometimes it just doesn't happen.<br /><br />Sometimes, everything is so rushed and mixed that nothing seems plausible. Reason is thrown out the window as I rush from class to class on a supposedly "normal" school day. I have to shove and force my way to my locker, and just getting inside of the classroom isn't going to save you. There's constant class antagonism and there's always someone who's answering more questions right than you. The pressure mounts as you try to impress the teacher, but end up just using pronouns in the wrong way. Or mumbling. I mumble lots. I can't help it, but I feel disrespectful when raising my voice or making eye contact with a superior. It's all out of place, and social cues are yet again missed, my reputation on the line. <br /><br />I get home and do homework for a bit. Realizing that I suck at everything I do, I turn on the music and try to forget that I have a life to maintain. You know, I can sometimes make myself feel like I'm not there. If I focus and sit completely still, I can have an "out of body" sensation. It feels fantastic. I try to move, but I can't. It's self-incurred paralysis, I suppose. All I know is that it feels like floating. After de-focusing, motor control doesn't kick in for a few minutes. Then I get dizzy. It's all over in a matter of 10 minutes. <br /><br />Oh, yes, homework. After my self-incurred paralysis session, I focus on more important things. Focus for more important things for about four hours. Bah, homework isn't important, is it? It's just tedious nonsense. I still do it. I still do it like some little child who doesn't know who to believe, just imitating other's actions. Dreaming that someday he could make something of his life.<br /><br />It sure hasn't happened yet. I'll just keep on drawing anthropomorphic nonsense and try to make the best of it.
