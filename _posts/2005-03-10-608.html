I have coined a nickname in QuizBowl. Finally!<br /><br />This has established roots for me to which I can grow on now. I really hope I can join QuizBowl next year, so I can be the "Sky Captain". I love my nickname. I also live "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow". It's just so... artsy...<br /><br />Well, not much happened today. A typical Thursday. Actually, there was alot that happened today. I'm just too lazy to type this late at night. But, I suppose I'll have a go at it.<br /><br />Well, in social studies Zach and I were to write about the United States' unifying traits pertaining to nationality, ethics, land, culture, etc. I started half-jokingly half-talkingly speaking about how the United States was obese and used science as a scapegoat. Yes, I believe that, but if Zach told everyone in the class, it wouldn't be so pretty. You know... Indiana is pretty conservative. The lack of knowledge just makes every Hoosier's (A native of Indiana) judgement even worse. Even Ryan, Indiana's tomorrow, thought that stem cells came from humanoid fetuses. NEWS FLASH: Stem cells come from a cluster of 40 cells. Maybe you crazy "Hoosiers" should read up on the subject before trying to debate about an issue. Geez... It makes me sick to think about all of these unknowing, incompetent, plain-dumb people who try to argue about things they don't understand. Perhaps I don't understand what I'm talking about, but that's why I try to keep my opinions hidden (Key word is "try") from others. I try, but it's human nature to argue. I guess all of those dumb people are humans too. I guess I can't blame them. Perhaps... I will anyways.
