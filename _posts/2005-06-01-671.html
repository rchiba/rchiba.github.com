I've joined various Forums with the intent of integrating myself into these communities. It's facinating how people can intellectually communicate feelings, emotions, and thoughts through this internet medium. How I love a good, local forum. Those huge, spammy, and flamey forums do not appeal to me. Members are good, but too many results in mass riots and chaos sweeping the virtual streets. This is what led me to indyddr.com which was recommended to me by my friend.<br /><br />I'm feeling truely worried for one of the first times in my life. It's about my family's visa and green card nonsense. I don't want to go back to Japan.
