Guess what?
<br />Today wasn't that bad. I would like to now explain the situation at my lunch table. My stupid classmates are so uneducated and so assuming. They assume that knowing about guns makes them "cool" and that because they play lame war games, they know about guns. They are so stupid. Always talking about guns and how they are making them. I really doubt ANYTHING they say is true. It is like they have no morals or anything. Guns? Is that all they care about? They should be shot in the hand a couple of times to experience the pain guns generate. To worship objects like guns is a sick practice only reserved to war veterans and scary people you meet in the street and in the country. Shishir are on the other side of the table laughing. I don't want those people to stop loving guns though. You ask why? Well, it's because people like them are the people who make physicians RICH. They shoot someone and boom, cash flows in. Being a physician is a very stable job. I know it will still be stable in the future because there are endless people who get hurt because of stupidity. I love the world :)

<br />Anyways, I have to write my optimist club speech. I sent half of my speech to Mr. Rice (My math teacher) and he said it was  only "OK". He said it wasn't great yet. I'm sooo not going to win that scholarship. I feel like I am being hammered down. I got all this competition. Also, there's been another discrepancy in COMM (communications class). I sit next to this girl called Lauren Braun. Everytime I talk, she insults me. It used to be funny, but not anymore. I think she should learn some manners. I don't do anything to her and she slams me into the ground face first. How enjoyable is that? I think she is just getting rid of her anger, but maybe she should disperse her anger in different ways. I type on this blog to disperse my anger.

<br />I spent 2 hours working on math today. I think that is a reccord. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. So, I have nothing good to talk about besides my misery and sorrow. SO I guess I say bye now. bye...
