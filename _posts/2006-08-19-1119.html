We made it!</i>-journal entry dated 10/7/98 by Ryo<br /><br />I found an old composition book sitting on the back of my bookshelf. In elementary school, I was prompted by my teachers to write various things to help me with my reading and writing skills. Every week, there would be some sort of theme. The passage above was from a "write your own story" themed writing day. Reading these words from back then opens little niches of memory in my mind. There are entries about building a backyard pool at my old house, dreams of flying, science experiments done in class, and about my self image. Many entries are just absurd stories that I made up, stories where I mixed up everything I saw in television shows (commercials too) and regurgitated all of it into one big, nonsensical mess of text. That's how a lot of kids do "creative writing", I suppose. <br /><br />But, half of the old comp notebook is empty. That bothers me. Pages are worthless without writing.
