I am to write an opinion article by monday.
<br />
<br />I suppose that I could rant on about some absurd topic, like squirels and animal testing, but I can't do that. There are rules in Journalism. Rules that are too restricting. I don't like Journalism. The teacher doesn't know who I am. Note to self: Journalism=Bad.
<br />
<br />I went to the diving meet. My heart was imploding and exploding rythmically while my stomach acid sloshed everywhere within my body. I was quite riled. The pool looked fuzzy, and I started getting dizzy. With a crappy twister (kind of dive) put together in 30 minutes, I was ready to go. I got on the diving board. Everything is silent. Fear is overtaking me. Then, I realize that fear is obsolete. What is fear? It is the instinctive reaction to a dangerous scenario. Was this dangerous? No. That means fear is illogical. I overrided the fear function in my brain and I felt a warm euphoria of energy now that the fear was abolished. I made my way toward the end of the diving board and did my crappy twister. 30 minutes later, I was done. Wow, it was very enjoyable. Rather than a embarassing event, the diving meet turned out to be quite fun. Why did I ever propose to quit diving? I change.
<br />
<br />Suppose I did quit diving. Where would I be? I would probablly end up depressed since that would mean I would have to go to the gym again. I can't go back there. Tomorow will bring a Biology test, therefore, I will study. Now. No really, I'm starting now. Now.
