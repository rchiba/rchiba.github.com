Walking down a bookstore aisle, I spot yet another technology magazine. Picking it up, I realize that it focuses on "the future", and what kinds of things are in store for the human race in the coming hundred, or even thousand, years. The glossy images of stylish chrome and enamel machines, men in tight plastic clothing, and brightly colored furniture are visually appealing. The text reads like any other easy-to-read time-killing article. No meat, just microwaved potatoes. <br /><br />Articles like this are a dime a dozen. Just perusing through the local bookstore, the Internet, or even your own mailbox, speculation about the future is abundant. Renderings and speculations about future technology spring up like weeds. There have been countless books that explain future societies, future ways of life, future governments, and future achievements. There's a whole subculture attached to this topic, and a whole television channel as well. Movies are no exception.<b> And it's not surprising at all.</b> We all wonder about things that are unknown. Humans are thinkers. We think about higher beings, think about extraterrestrial life, think about the upcoming results from a test or election, and think about where stock prices are heading. So, how is the future any different? Why am I writing a post about it?<br /><br />The future is different because it is something that is largely predictable. It sounds absurd, but judging from the last 2 millennia, the next 2 millennia don't seem as exciting as the glossy pictures. <br /><br />While we all gawk at depictions of a future society in which citizens are merely slaves to the government a la Ninteen-Eighty-Four, there's much we can say for sure about tomorrow's tomorrow's tomorrow.<br /><br />Let's look at ourselves today. Popular culture has created a celebrity-worshiping society. There is much corruption in governments all over the Earth. Crime proceeds to dismantle the architecture of the law. One must look harder to find cooperation than to find irrational bickering. People die of malnutrition, and the rest of the world is dying of some other "epidemic". The majority of the public is uneducated and will mindlessly follow a nicely groomed, fast-talking leader. People propel pellets of metal into each other and ruthlessly let blood run free while the rest of the world turns a blind eye. We trade little slips of green paper for a black, vile liquid so we can burn it to move ourselves in shiny metal canisters and impress our neighbors. We spend billions of dollars on music, then spend billions of hours arguing over who "owns" it. Allthewhile calling ourselves "civilized", as if it's some kind of kosher label that we can slap on our foreheads to declare that we are superior to those before us.<br /><br />People before us, thousands of years before us, are the same people we are now. Truly, they were just as "civilized" as we are now.  Sure, we have plenty of technology. Sure, the ancients didn't have computers or ballpoint pens. Sure, our tastes in clothing differ. But they argued, killed, and mindlessly followed leaders just as well as we do. They had imaginations too, and must have wondered what it would be like today. I'm sure they would be impressed by all of the sleek black plastic, bright LCDs, and the many fast methods of human propulsion, but how would they judge us as a world? What would they think of our ability to destroy our planet with a few phone calls and a push of a few buttons? What would they think of the fuss over terrorism? If they could only jump through the window of time to give us a third party opinion.<br /><br />And if only we could jump through the window as well. What would we see? Undoubtedly, a world with the same problems we have now. Sure, they'll have shiny new vehicles and fantastic new inventions. But, I'm sure that the majority of people will still ignore flossing as part of their daily routine. I know that they'll be killing each other in new and innovative ways. Warfare is the chief contributor towards the advancement of science and technology. Things will appear to "get better" though. Cities will grow and eventually cover vast swaths of land. Computers will become much more than the solitaire-loading beige boxes we function with today. Many diseases will be cured, and problems solved.<br /><br />But in the end, people will be dancing and playing, sinning and praying, coughing and wheezing, living and dying. <br /><br />Until we leave this planet, or perhaps the universe, until we break through the barrier that is set by our own nature, the future will be the present will be the past. <br /><br />In the meantime, microwaved potatoes don't seem half bad.
