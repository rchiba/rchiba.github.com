I have condemned myself to my room for the past few hours. My "Romeo and Juliet" book card has been finished, after much ado. Check it out on the "Book Cards" link. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I've been sitting here trying to figure out what to do next. I don't know where to start. It's like climbing Mt. Everest and not knowing where to set up base camp. I could do my Biology. That would last for hours. I could do my Journalism. I could do... Anyways, like you care about what kind of homework I do. I'll move on for your sake.
<br />
<br />I've checked out Devin's blog. It makes me have a feel-good feeling inside of me, it's nice to know that your contacts are alive and well. Anyways, I went to the diving tournament and probably got last place, but I'm not really caring. I did the best I could and that's all that matters. By the way, two liters of Mountain Dew and diving don't mix. Don't try it.

<br />Troy directed me to go to www.rotten.com. It's very graphic,
<br />
<br />I have to go. Bye.
