Ok, today was bad for me. It started being bad on the bus, it ended when I got off. I hated today. Waaay too uncontrolled. I gotta keep all variables in check next time! Anyways, I stink at volleyball, that's for sure. I am also horrendous at remembering things. Arghhh... How I hate my brain capacity sometimes. 
<br />
<br />ANyways, Matt told me to tell the world that he e-mailed me. So there...
<br />
<br />Also, I am trying to get myself to be uninfluenced by feelings. All tests are inconclusive. More experimentation is needed. All variables are uncontrolable. Such as rage. I consider feelings being obsolete. Only love is productive. For without love, the world is gone. Offspring can't materialize without love....

<br />Anyways, back to the subject of my life... oh yea, I don't have anything to talk about. Stupid me. My thoughts have not become of true potential yet.
<br />I must let them grow...
