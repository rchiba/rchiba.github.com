I blame Christmas.<br /><br />Yes, I'm lacking because I'm in a complacent mood. Things are alright, and you know what? My life is alright enough that it doesn't have to be nagged, written about, attacked, coaxed, described. It's great. No school. Painting in the afternoon, the occasional Need For Speed break, mid-afternoon snack. It's like kindergarten, but without the sticky hands and claustrophobic bathroom. <br /><br />Presents, yes presents. What have I bagged this year? Nice stuff. I have a new purse/bag/item-holder, two actually, and a comfortable fleece jacket thanks to Tiffany. A tamagotchi from Ryan. Two video games, <span style="font-style:italic;">Need For Speed Underground 2</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Geist</span> (which is damaged and won't play, so I must take it back to JL Records tomorrow. I very much hope their return policies on used games are lenient). The video games I bought for my sister and I. <br /><br />So that's this year. I love it all. Functional, fun, random. A good mix of my favorite flavors of consumerism. <br /><br />I'm glad the Wii is on the scene. It means the Gamecube is old news. Ten dollar bargain-basement used games, here I come!<br /><br />Oh, this winter break is swell. Even if it is rainy.
