Right after coming home from Devin's house, I had to go to the gym. Exhausting. Pure exhaustingment. On other news, I went to olive garden, but why should you care? On Other Other news, I have trillian! W00t. It combines AIM, MSN Messenger, ICQ, and IRC. It has SKINS. Can you believe it... SKINS! Anyways, my anti-aol-cd-coalition has 5 cds so far. That's pretty good progress... right?
