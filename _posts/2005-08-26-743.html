OfficeMax Adventures.<br /><br />So one day I decided that a scanner would be nice to have. Well, what really got me to think about it was the fact that my friend's brother got a scanner. This friend asked me if I wanted to have things scanned. The answer to this question is no, because I have transportation issues. <br /><br />A quick search landed me at OfficeMax demanding a $29.99 scanner. Well, the folks there said that I had to have "proof" of this "instant rebate" that I found online. Come on, this is from their own online store, and they can't even sell me a scanner for the same price as their website. They say that I have to go home and print off the page from the website. They suck.<br /><br />I'm fuming, and rushing back home. I get home, print off the bloody page, and I rush back off to OfficeMax. I get there and a guy name "Kyle" tells me that I could have just picked up the advertising pamphlet at the door, and show them the "proof" that the scanner was actually thirty dollars. Mr. Manager decided not to tell me that earlier, who knows why... Three gallons of gas later, I'm back home with my precious. <br /><br />I hate OfficeMax.
