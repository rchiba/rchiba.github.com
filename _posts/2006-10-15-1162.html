"<i>They're shooting them like dogs!</i>", said a foreigner as he looked across the snowy mountains. Across the valley, he saw a line of people slowly walking up the mountain, no farther than three kilometers away. Only, a few weren't walking, instead sprawled on the snow. On his side of the mountain, a lone soldier, dressed in regulation green and grey dress, held a rifle. The lone soldier fired another round. With a sharp crack, another dot on the other side of the valley stops moving. On the other side of the Earth, I sit here and drink my cup of water, looking through a window to a land faraway, where another man shoots, another man dies.<a href="http://www.protv.ro/filme/exclusive-footage-of-chinese-soldiers-shooting-at-tibetan-pilgrims.html#4265" target="_blank">[LINK]</a><br /><br />Today was a lonely day. The overcast sky makes everything look dead and artificial. It gets darker as I type this, the thing illuminating my keyboard is an old fluorescent lamp. Nothing seems human. I don't think I've smiled today. <br /><br />But, today wasn't meant to be a smiling day anyway. It was a day where I sat down on my bed and read <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> and <i>The Celestial Railroad</i>, both by an author obsessed with writing long, long sentences of dreary, difficult text. It must have been the language of the day, so he is pardoned. These boring stories match this boring day of what was supposed to be rest, but quickly became anxiety. <br /><br />For enjoyment, I close my textbooks up and read a little bit of <i>Maus</i>. It's a graphic novel, so it helps a simple mind like mine. I read of lice, pus, burning flesh, and other such things associated with the Holocaust. I also read about love, risk, and the luck of a man, or mouse, insistent on surviving. <br /><br />Going to a robotics meeting today, I felt isolated. Always have, I couldn't have expected any better. The meeting felt so... constraining. All talk and no action. What action was there to take anyway? Planning. I'm not a fantastic planner. Meetings are always full of grand plans of success and ideal dates to strive for. In reality, things end up being a matter of passing the buck until it gets done. Sometimes, the buck never stops, so we just shoot the buck and hang it up over the fireplace. Shooting is not preferred.<br /><br />Not even an email from another person. No phone calls. No chatting. No confiding of personal secrets, or exchanges of curious gossip. No voice to respond to. It's quiet. It's lonely. I miss my friends. I miss the sun. Time passes, nothing changes. The sky will be getting darker all winter.
