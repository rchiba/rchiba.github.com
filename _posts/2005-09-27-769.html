I've thought about doing a daily three panel, primitive comic strip of my life. I've been doing them since last week, and they're just taking up space in my sketch pad. It's still just a thought. I don't want to rush into things just yet, when I'm still doing all of these things to learn how to draw. Experience is needed before I jump head first into webcomics all over again. Oh, the memories of mediocrity. I don't even want to get into when I first tried all of this nonsense. It was truely laughable.<br /><br />But, sometimes caution is too strong of a force in my life. For example, at DDR Club today, I was too cautious and shy to approach anyone and start a conversation. I couldn't even take good pictures. I tried to shy away, to a corner, but ended up standing in line to play, just wanting to be like everyone else. Somehow, I get to play, and it's fun. I realize that my extreme caution was unfounded, until a kid decides to be obnoxious and cut me in line every time I try to touch the gaming apparatus. I get frustrated, and go stand in a corner again.<br /><br />It's like a never ending circle of misery. Just as I start to trust society, I am reminded that life is full or jerks and that it's better to be safe than sorry. Constantly, I berate myself on how dangerously shy I am, but it's hard to cope with instincts. Well, I think they're instincts. I just happen to always have the urge to be with myself. I suppose you could call me a lone crusader, a solitudarian of some sort. It's my nature.<br /><br />And still, I'm trying to justify my anti-social tendancies. I shouldn't try to justify it, but instead, admit that I have a serious problem and try to rehabilitate myself. Perhaps someday you'll see me in a cave somewhere, trying to role play with stones. <br /><br />I can see it. Can you?
