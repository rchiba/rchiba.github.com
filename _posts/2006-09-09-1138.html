Didn't write yesterday in any of my journals. After arriving home just before midnight, I had barely enough energy to climb the stairs to my room. After struggling up the stairs, I wrote an email to Tiffany and promptly fell asleep. The weekend is a much needed shelter from the hurries and stress of school. Just a time to sit in front of a fan and listen to light jazz while reading a magazine, or watching the sky.<br /><br />There's a time in any illness where one comes to accept the symptoms. I've already forgotten what it feels like to be without this these annoying headaches and other things that have plagued me all this week. I'm in the mid-to-latter stage of being sick, so I expect to be cured by the end of this week. That is if I keep my fatigue in check. <br /><br />The football game on friday was very fun. Lots of friends, peers, a few teachers. Most were amicable. Those hours were, again, what I was looking forward to all week. Being with Tiffany without the constricting atmosphere of school felt absolutely great. Although, as all school-related events are, there was still a hint of awkwardness floating around the field. <br /><br />I think I'm doing well in terms of reducing this awkwardness in myself. I'm always trying to stop being so self-conscious about expressing the existence of the relationship. It's easier to do now, I mean, I held her hand in front of teachers (<i><u>unthinkable</u> just a few months ago</i>). Is it proof that I'm getting better? <br /><br />At the football game, I realized how many people I know. It's a social event, so of course there are going to be loads of people. But, why do they all know me? Why would they want to? Tiffany commented on being known from association now that we're together and it made me think about my social situation. Think about all the pros and cons of this social status.<br /><br />Well, it's late, and the weekend is for sleep. So, I'm off to sleep.
