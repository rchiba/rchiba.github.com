Yay! Justin is staying! Hurray, kudos to you Justin! Congratulations Ryo, great job on first place! Sorry about your Alpha leader # 1 problem, though ^^
<br />Well, Amanda is back and about 76% better (still sick D@mn it!) My new little sister just left a lil while ago (thank you! I'm so tired @_@). I am going to try to update my life more, sorry there are no rants today. Only sickness and concern.
<br />The concern? I dunno if I'm totally cool with the marriage thing, but oh well. I'll write later.. Too tired.. glub..glub... boom.
<br />~Amanda
