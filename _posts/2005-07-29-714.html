If I could somehow convince the research and development team at the A1 Steak Sauce HQ to change one thing about their product, it would probably be the structure of the bottle. What really is absurd about the A1 Steak Sauce bottle is that it does everything a bottle is supposed to do in the worst possible manner. You might as well get some delerious, drunken hobo to suddenly break into your house and raid the refrigerator to break open the A1 bottle to get the sauce out. The sauce isn't that amazing anyways. It tastes like a sweet worcestershire sauce. I don't really like it that much. I just eat it because the commercials force me to. That and my mother bought it one day and I'm the only one in my family that can tolerate its taste.<br /><br />About the bottles. Again, I would like to restate the fact that these bottles are terrible, horrible things. Yes, there are plenty of fantastic designs for bottles out there in the market right now that reduce spilling, dripping, leaking, crusty sauce stuff on the bottle cap, sauce clumping, time-to-sauce output ratio, and general frustration. The A1 Steak Sauce bottle looks like this:<br /><br /><center><img SRC="http://www.walgreens.com/dbimagecache/200769.jpg"></center><br /><br />This bottle looks like a normal, friendly bottle at first, but as you use it, you discover it's hidden dark side. Then, the bottle becomes your enemy. Every day, as you try to extract the valuable saucy goods trapped within, the bottle struggles against you. Every waking moment becomes a conflict. A frustrating, excruciating, and expletive-filled conflict. A conflict that can be solved, by killing your enemy. With the bottle half full, the only way to get the sauce out is with a nice hard counter, and a large mallet. Voila! Instant sauce release. If only life weren't as messy.<br /><br />A1 bottles posses powers. Powers to keep a sauce that you righteously bought at the local grocery away from you. Powers to punish the extractor after the sauce is released. Powers to keep this sauce on grocery store shelves next time you make a trek to the store. The long neck of the bottle keeps the flow of air and sauce from travelling side-by-side. This results in a sauce that is always "stuck" inside of the bottle. When the sauce does come out, it is always in a rapid spitfire fashion. Sauce is splatted onto your salad, your rice, your gelatin, and your drink. The poorly designed rim does not keep itself clean. It stays as clean about as much as an autistic baby trapped inside of a septic tank. Cleaning the rim with a paper towel is a must to keep the rim of the bottle reasonably clean of hazardous sauce-crust. <br /><br />Why must I suffer such toil and wrath at the hand of a sauce bottle?! Why!?
