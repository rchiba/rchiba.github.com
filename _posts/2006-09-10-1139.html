Â Watching <i>40 Year Old Virgin</i> with Ryan helped curb my boredom today. It was all a thoroughly relaxing experience. Thanks to today, my cold is almost gone. To think, a week's worth of recovery with stress can't match the power of one day of recovery with no stress. It all ends in an hour though, when I'll go to sleep early in anticipation for the next five days of push, push, push. I'm fine with that though. There have to be uncomfortable times, lots of them, to make one value comfort.
