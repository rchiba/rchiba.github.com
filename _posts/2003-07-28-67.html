Hi, most of you reading this probably dont know me so allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Justin(one of Ryo's friends).  I am 13 years old and in 8th grade.  
<br />
<br />The reason I am wrighting on this blog is because Ryo asked me if i would like to join him in his web site and i agreed.  So here i am today writing to probably nobody.  At least this gives me something to do.
<br />
<br />Now i might as well tell you what's happened or what's going to happen today.  Anyway, I just got done chatting with Ryo on msn messenger.  We regularly talk day by day.  Now I will regularly be typing to anyone who decides to come and check out this site.  As of now, i'm not quite sure what i will be doing today.  I think I am going to the gym and play Racquet Ball with my brother and dad.  Well, that's all I've gotta say today. Seeya.
