Hey blog-thing. I apologize for not updating, and to ryo too. I've been quite busy with school and all the things I've been doing. I guess I'll let you know about my life. This summer I lost, probably, ten or twenty pounds, and school is going great. In Japanese class I'm the only one who actually complied to mr. Peterson's strong, and most ferverent wish to memorize all the simple Hiragana in about a week. I did in about four days. I'm so proud. All my other classes are great, and being the locker above my sister isn't so bad. I'm trying to make time to post in the blog more, so yay. Next month I'm going to conduct a scientific experiment. I'm going to see how much weight I loose and how much happier I feel if I eat only cherrios for breakfast, a jelly sandwich and some type of fruit and maybe a healthy extra something for lunch, and some sort of soup for dinner. If I get really hungry and I need a snack I plan on getting those energy bars or something like that. I'm then going to keep a log for progress and weightloss. Also, my mom and I might check out International, I'm so excited. I really hope she lets me get a membership. I even have a plan to pay for it! See, since I mow the lawn four times a month on average, all that money can go towards the membership fee. Then, when I do extra house work (ie: vacuuming, dusting, etc...) that can be my spending money! Happiness and joy! I might even be allowed to cook dinner!
<br />So, that's my life in short. I'll try to update later on this week!
<br />~Amanda
