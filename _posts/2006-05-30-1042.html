<b>DIY Fun with Ryo!</b><br /><br />Trying to get away from thinking about the inevitable doom that will accompany tomorrow, I tried my hand at crafting together something that I've wanted to build. I mean, there aren't a lot of things I can build with the crap tools in my house, which include an old saw used to cut branches off of trees, pliers, a weak cordless drill, screws, a screwdriver, a ruler, and tape.  Should I build a table? Too big. Should I build a toy boat? Too dorky. Should I build an ICBM? Too Iran-esque. <br /><br />Then, it came to me, I should build a lightbox, a thing used by animators to look at images below images. So, I grabbed the tools, and headed toward my room to scrounge for materials.<br /><img src="http://img439.imageshack.us/img439/3503/p10100020xy.jpg" title="Look at me and my saw!" width="320" height="240" border="0"><br /><br /><br />Lightbox require two things. Light, and a transparent surface. Well, maybe three things. A lightbox needs pegs as well. A cheap table lamp sufficed for the light. I think it's older than I am. <br /><img src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/8595/p10100069bi.jpg" title="Wow, amazing, a lamp." border="0"><br /><br /><br />Then, I found a whitish opaque plastic container. It held old cassettes. So, I ditched the cassettes and took the container. I'll have to clean my closet <i>sometime</i> this summer. Just not today.<br /><img src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/4844/p10100214ap.jpg" title="tsk, tsk, tsk... A dirty closet." border="0"><br /><br /><br />With the empty container in hand, I got to work, cutting a rectangular hole in each side so that the lamp could be inserted into the container. Let me tell you, after an hour of trying to saw plastic with a dull saw, you would trade your refrigerator for a bandsaw in a heartbeat.<br /><img src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/5908/p10100033lr.jpg" title="Look at me almost cut myself! I must be emo!" border="0"><br /><br /><br />Eventually, the box fits over the lamp like this:<br /><img src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/7569/p10100073me.jpg" title="Close fit right there. I'm lucky." border="0"><br /><br /><br />For the pegs, I have a few options. I can go with taping pegs down, gluing pegs down, or screwing pegs in. I go with the last option, as it seems the most stable. Plus, it's easy to thread plastic. So, I run downstairs to discreetly grab the cordless drill. In no time at all, I'm drilling like a maniac.<br /><img src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/7139/p10100057yz.jpg" title="I look like a psycho killer." border="0"><br /><br /><br />After the screws are threaded through my drilled holes, the semi-finished hunk of plastic looks something like this:<br /><img src="http://img428.imageshack.us/img428/3799/p10100093tu.jpg" title="Enjoy the image of the semi-finished hunk of plastic that looks like shit." border="0"><br /><br /><br />Well, I'm basically finished, so I make another run downstairs to steal my sister's tracing paper. She'll never miss it if she doesn't know it's gone. <br /><img src="http://img428.imageshack.us/img428/6771/p10100104jl.jpg" title="I'm a thief! A paper thief!" border="0"><br /><br /><br />While cutting the tracing paper squares out, I realize why I failed kindergarten.<br /><img src="http://img428.imageshack.us/img428/285/p10100123gh.jpg" title="I'm a failure. Again." border="0"><br /><br /><br />I manage to salvage four out of seven squares. Yes, I managed to fail the "cut-paper-squares-out" test with a %57. I bet retarded siamese twins could cut paper better than me. After I peg the papers on, I start to get pre-marit-... I mean, pre-"turn-on-the-crap-invention-you-made" jitters.<br /><img src="http://img428.imageshack.us/img428/7540/p10100138hm.jpg" title="Jitterific!" border="0"><br /><br /><br />I flick the on switch, and BOOM. The magic white light illuminates my room. I celebrate by collapsing on the floor beside it and taking a picture of myself with said light source.<br /><img src="http://img428.imageshack.us/img428/6213/p10100151ce.jpg" title="WOAH, IT WORKS." border="0"><br /><br /><br />Too tired to hold a pencil with my right hand, I somehow manage to draw random stick figures on the four scraps of paper pegged to the lightbox. <br /><img src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/5803/p10100164tr.jpg" title="That stick figure looks like the virgin mary." border="0"><br /><br /><br />The images show through, and so the lightbox creation DIY madness is deemed a success.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my mother saw me carrying a saw, cordless drill, and screwdriver out of my room. I'm glad I didn't hurt myself. Although, a red lightbox would be pretty neat.<br /><br />So that's the end of the DIY madness. I urge you all to go out and put random things together with junk in your rooms. All it takes is some time, and I know we all have that now that it's summer. Go build! Hooah! <br /><br />
