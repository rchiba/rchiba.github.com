I spent halloween staying up and doing nothing in particular. So, there goes my saved up sleep. Wasted. Wasted thinking about tomorrow's events. Wasted thinking about how my life has become a series of deadlines and entries in my schedule and lists of tasks to be done. <br /><br />There wasn't anything to enjoy from the vacation I took for fall break. Social isoation, physical isolation. Getting nothing done, it was so frustrating. I can't relax when there's so much work piling up. And so how does this work pile up during vacation? I make it up sometimes, or imagine homework due when it's not, or expect myself to meet irrational due dates. I plan, I lay everything down and arrange, I read and read and read. <br /><br />Then, when I fail the summary test, everything seems like a waste. The effort, the successive tries. A waste of effort when the outcome is inevitably failure. And I start to realize what's going through the minds of the people who pass through school with D's and C's in regular classes.<br /><br />Can they see something I can't, or is it the other way around?<br /><br />Or am I ranting so I can fill up space for today's entry? For the sake of filling it up, so I can get back on the rythm of writing regularly? Because, I'm getting the feeling that that is what I am doing. Because it's late at night and I can't think of anything important, deep, or witty to discuss with myself.<br /><br />I almost cried at school today. Why am I so weak? <i>So fucking weak...</i>
