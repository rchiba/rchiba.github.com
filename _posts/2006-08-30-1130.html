What is success?<br/><br/>Is it self-worth? Or power and respect? Perhaps it's money and material wealth?<br/><br/>It's a lot of things to different people, but I don't know what it means for me. I would enjoy many of these things that I mentioned above, but I could go without them too. And if I never got any of these things, I wouldn't kill myself over it. I don't know what I'm working for, why I'm doing the homework, to get the grades, to put on paper, to send to college, to study for exams, to get an education, to apply for a job, to enter a career, to make money, to retire from, to spend in my later, to have a leisurely elderly life, to live happily ever after, to die.<br/><br/>To die.<br/><br/><i>To die.</i><br/><br/>To die is what I'm working for? <br/><br/>No, no. <i>That can't be it.</i> Then, what am I aiming towards? What's my net goal? And when I get there, what do I do? These sequence of events, they're what life is, and it bothers me. <br/><br/>Doesn't it bother you that your existence, my existence, our existences are so simple? That we are so insignificant  by ourselves? That pain we go through every day is for an individual goal that will probably never be accomplished and a common goal that every single person is attached to?<br/><br/>And the objects that I hold in my hand. A pencil, a keyboard, a telephone. They're made by people thousands of miles away and across an ocean. They are so far away, but they're people too, right? And what about their goals? Is their goal to make pencils so foreign people in a faraway land can sharpen them? Do they make our computers so we can throw them away in a few years? Thousands of them, they're all the same. An enormous mass of generic individuals, ready to sacrifice many years of their lives. They are the same. Yet, each one is different. Each is a brother, sister, uncle, father, mother. Each has individual passions, talents, and philosophies. But, do they make a difference individually? If one disappeared one day, would the world stop for one life?<br/><br/>We sit here and complaisantly read each others blog posts  while buildings fall. While warm, lively, healthy human bodies are shredded by little metal spheres. They die because they were born in an unfortunate land. When they die, do they make a difference? Do their lives really matter?<br/><br/><i>If I die and you die too, who will remember us in twenty years? A hundred years? A thousand?</i><br/><br/><i>If I die and you die too, <strong>what would we have done to make us worth our time alive?<br/></strong></i><i><strong><br/></strong></i>If I die and you die too, will these questions be answered?<i><strong><br/></strong></i><br/>
