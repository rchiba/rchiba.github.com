It's early. Early morning.<br /><br />I guess I could call it a passion. A sting. I was seduced. Pang! Another rush of emotion. Click, click. And it's almost done. Glance at the clock, and I realize that it's no longer Friday, but early Saturday morning. <br /><br />No, I wasn't looking at porn in the wee hours of the morning, although the thought is quite humorous.<br /><br />What did happen was that I finally finished my 10 Second Club animation. You wouldn't believe how long this animation (which is actually 15 seconds long) took me. True sweat, tears, and not so much blood, my friends. Twenty hours of it, I figure. Or perhaps it's ten. Time gets mangled and disfigured when you're a raving animating machine intent on perfecting a stray keyframe. <br /><br />So I guess this is when I sigh a sigh of relief, slump to bed, and try to get a few meager hours of sleep before my parents abandon me at the library tomorrow. Oh, how I loathe English papers. A perfectly fine weekend, now tarnished by paper-writing. Not to mention that I have to write a speech as well.<br /><br />There's no point in complaining further. I'll just have to take it how it comes at me.
