School, school, school.
<br />
<br />That's the topic for all the kids out there right now isn't it? You either hate it or love it. I go with the flow. You can't change the inevitable, so why resist? High school should be a good change of routine for me. I mean, east tipp doesn't have many people to network with. At harrison on the other hand, you can meet new people every day. Plus, I'll have more things to talk about. I mean c'mon, it's pretty darn obvious that summer has been a low-topic time of the year for blogs (my blog anyways). But alas, might as well embrace it. (Is my reluctance showing?) Anyways...
<br />
<br />I've been working on a very large stick figure animation. What have I learned? I have learned that my computer can't handle 2,456 gif images at one time. Does anyone here a Catastrophical Error here? My compter ran out of Random Access Memory and had a "catastrophical error" to my surprise. Now I'm going to try to cut my animations into pieces to save the RAM. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I registered for school and memorized my classes and everything. I suppose that things will work out all right. But what if they don't? I'll just work it out myself. I was talking to Joe and he was very VERY reluctant to go to school. I mean, it's going to happen and you can't stop it. I'll probably make a TON of bad first impressions and then everyone is going to mispronounce my name, but that's old stuff. I'm feeling optimistic. Are you?
