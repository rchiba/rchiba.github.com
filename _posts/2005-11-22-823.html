Today was definitely a work day.<br /><br />Lots of work, and homework, and more work, and some more work on top of that. It really is enough work to shake your red, commie fist at.<br /><br />Right now, I really can't think of anything to say.<br /><br />Besides being ripped off by the Motorola customer service reps, for the fifth time, I can't think of anything particularly outstanding today.<br /><br />Wait, actually there is something that stood out today.<br /><br />At DDR club today, there were 3 people who told me that I looked very sad. I know that at the time, my body was in a critical low-blood-sugar crisis. To curve my intense hunger and dizzyness, I bumbled my way to the nearest vending machine and bought some toaster pastries. I ate them, and got a headache. Too much sugar never helps. The artificial taste of the starchy "bread" part of the pastry did not help my condition.<br /><br />And so, while in this state of calamity, I apparently looked sad.<br /><br />The "lesson" learned? (This lesson is the lesson that I usually make up to justify living for one more day) <br /><br />Hungry people look sad.
