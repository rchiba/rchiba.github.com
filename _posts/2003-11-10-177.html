Have you ever noticed that everyone is so lazy?  WHY?  People never want to do things for themselves.  I'm talking about EVERYONE.  Not just a few people...EVERYONE.  A few days ago, at school, I saw someone open their lunch box, take out a sandwich, look at it for a second, and then walk straight over to the trash can and throw it away.   I mean, he didn't even TOUCH it, or unwrap, or anything except THROW IT AWAY.  WHat I'm trying to say is that if you like what your  parents make you for lunch, MAKE IT YOURSELF!!!!! You should make it yourself anyway...I do because my parents no that I can do things for myself.  I can't wait to see those inocmpetent idiots when their older saying,"Mommy, could you make my lunch for school tomorrow?"  And then when their mom says to do it their self, they won't know what to do. I'll laugh right in their face because they don't know how to do anything without their "mommy" around.HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!  Now, I will let those how are too lazy and stupid to do anything fo rhtemselves rot for the rest of their incompetent lives.
