Abashed once again!<br /><br />I was checking out silly Xangas to see what the silly children that inhabit my social life were discussing. I was quite amazed to see that Devin is quite witty. Quite a bit more witty than me. Yes, I'm envious. Envy, envy of his hair, his popularity, his outrageous spending of local currency on sugared treats. His silly little witticisms. Oh yes, his parties and his friends. Yes, his pure beliefs, and his not so pure, but oh so powerful, image. Yes, I loathe Devin. He's the perfect person I could never be. How horribly I exist in his amazing shadow. Terrorized constantly by myself, always wanting to be as good as Devin, but never reaching any of my superficial goals. Sometimes, I would rather be a popular genius than a shut-in idiot. Well, maybe always.<br /><br />How he writes with eloquency that I cannot achieve. How he scripts and composes. His motor skills that are unquestionably better than mine. The perfect person? Quite possibly.<br /><br />Yes, as I write on and on about how much better he is than me, you're probably thinking, "Stupid idiot, how dare he feel worse than I! His life is perfect and mine isn't! Let us grab pitchforks and storm his house!" <br /><br />Well, I am anticipating your silly pitchfork raid now, so don't even try. Yes, I am a silly child. A silly, unimaginative child at that.
