Preface: It's hard to write anything substantial without being afraid to reveal a misguided thought or a slip in judgement. I think it's fear more than laziness that has prevented me from writing anything for the past year. I feel like I've forgotten the feeling of writing. So here goes nothing.

I am in the parking lot in Pasadena, just after a proposal by Idealab to fund a project that I have been working on for the past two months: Hypemarks. It's a relatively straightforward webapp / social network that takes the links you share on facebook and helps you organize and share them. I was very happy that the meeting went well. My teammates are very happy, calling their families and significant others. They walk around the lot in circles on their phones, and I find myself looking over the chain link fence, sweating through my charcoal button-up, absentmindedly allowing my eyes to follow the cars on the freeway. Feeling good about myself, but feeling anxious all of a sudden. Over the winter, I was offered a summer internship at Twitter, and I was set to finish up my graduate classes the semester after. The meeting at Idealab was the first tug of a string that would begin to unravel the certainty of my future plans.

The unraveling was chaotic. In my heart, I knew I had to take the strange route that had appeared before me, but in my mind, I knew of the things I would be giving up. Pay,Â Prestige, Safety. Now, before you go on imagining the romance of abandoning the typical corporate career path, I assert that popular culture too readily dismisses the notion of safety. Safety is a wonderful thing, and I certainly cannot belittle the majority who choose it.
