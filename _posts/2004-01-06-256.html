I'm sorry I haven't been updating. I just, I dunno... I feel so close to a breaking point right now. 
<br />I know, I know. Excuses excuses I'm being a freaking hypocrite. I just can't help it. I'm tired, and I'm sick of everything. Angela had just.. Changed so much and it hurts. I know I shouldn't feel anything as I'm not good enough to do so but it just hurts. It hurts so much and sometimes I just can't take it. I dislike this vulnerable feeling. I dislike these feelings I'm having when someone gets near me anymore. I just want to run away or get it over with. I can feel that little crack in me just getting larger and larger. Yet, I'm afraid to approach it because I don't want to wind up like Angela. For the love of everything decently <em>sane</em> she was out in the middle of the street waiting to get run over the other day! Sometimes I don't know how much I can take. This feeling is so horrid, so ghastly it seems more than I can bear sometimes...
<br />decently yours,
<br />~Amanda
