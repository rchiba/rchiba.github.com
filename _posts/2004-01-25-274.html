Blog thing, hello. What's new here? Oh, I dunno. It's snowing. I'm tired, and I'm annoyed. Oh yes, a complaint! Ha! Mock me all you want but I just can't take any more crap without venting. Ok, blog, prepare to get an earfull!
<br />This weekend? Annoying. Why? Charlene came over. It should have been good and nice, but that kid is reeeaaly getting on my nerves. First, she's too d@mn cautious! She wont do anything without asking a million times if its ok! Second, if she doesn't get her way, she'll sulk. She doesn't use proper grammar. She wont stop hitting me! Then, when she gets hurt because I finally retaliate, she sulk,s whines, complains, or starts acting all b*tchy! It's so gosh darn annoying! Worse yet, she is just as bad as the dogs about being underfoot! She has this thing where she has to cling! It's annoying. I've tripped so many gosh d@amned times this weekend it isn;t even funny. Worse yet, when I want to be by myself with no touchie feelie things, guess who comes along?! UGGGH! >.< Bad day, bad day! Worse yet, today when we got to the library, my mother complained beuase i seemed annoyed. Who else WOULDN'T be anoyed when unresponsible parents let their gosh darn kids run around like insane little monkies?!! WHO?! WHO WOULDN'T BE! And with my anxity in public, this just made it worse. Ugh, i don't like it when people get underfoot! And then Charlene will stare at me and say 'poh your mad at me!' and then she'll run off when I'm not! I CAN control my temper. So what i got a LITTLE p*ssy at the gas station when the pump backfired on me, who the heck wouldn't? Besauides, it was only once! ONCE! Charlene gets angry all the time! Aren't I aloud to get angry too?!!!?!?!?!?! More to my bad day, Mom and Kurt are drinking, balring their Ra-forsaken music. The floor is vibrating. And would you GUESS where its the loudest? yep, my room. My freaking room. The only remotly good thing about this weekened was i was able to control my feelings and get lots of books. Thank the lucky stars for THAT little piece of heaven. And to any one reading this? I don't give a flying DUCK if you make dun of me. I'VE HAD IT!
