Life plods on.<br /><br />Rather, excalates, like one giant crescendo that stretches from here to eternity. <br /><br />Something I've noticed, music pollution. Due to our constant contact with music, it has lost much of its charm, magic, and purpose. Personally, music is having less and less of an effect on my mind. No longer do the complex and melodic rythms of my favorite tunes inspire me to work faster or harder. Music tolerance is a problem. I wake up to an alarm clock programmed to play jazz, get on a rap-playing bus, sit next to classmates that are blasting punk rock through the air, go home in a car tuned to an oldies radio station, and sit in my room and turn on my stereo, which pours indie music out. It's clogged up my mind, clouded the air, I can hardly see through it wherever I go. What is the point of music when it becomes a sort of noise? Sure, portable music devices has brought music consumption to the masses, but slowly the ability of music to captivate an audience is slowly fading away. <br /><br />It ties into today because I finally caught onto why I've been taking so long to do homework and other tasks in my room. <b>The music.</b> For the first time in a long time, I turned off the stereo when I walked into my room and worked in quiet. In the end, I got done with my homework quicker, and I felt better about myself. There was something about the ambeint noise that filled the room when the music was turned off, like chirping birds, or some whining kid across the street. Something comforting.<br /><br />And I think it's a sad thing when something as amazing as music begins to degrade due to overconsumption.<br /><br />Fruits that get too ripe begin to rot. And in the same way, our extreme exposure to music has cheapened the experience as a whole.<br /><br />I saw a spider crawl next to me when I was sitting on my couch this evening. I'm afraid to get near the couch now. This is bad, as I find my couch very comfortable to do homework in. I plan to Lysolify and cleanse my room sometime this week. I haven't done so in a while now. <br /><br />Oh yes, Google Video has finished verifying my little character animation analysis clip. If you want to see it, go here: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1533736450543236286" target="_blank">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1533736450543236286</a>.<br /><br />I have just realized that it is thirty seconds until midnight. I better hit the "Post" button quick.
