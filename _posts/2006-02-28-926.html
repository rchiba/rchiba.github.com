Attempting to rediscover and understand my past is difficult. From many accounts, I was an arrogant jerk. Because anything before 8th grade was not documented in textual format, much (perhaps, all) of the memories of that time have all but vanished. It's so odd that something as important as memories of the turbulent transition from Alabama to Indiana cease to exist. I believe that maybe those memories were banished from my mind on purpose. For all I know, I was brutally killing off my political enemies with an aluminum bat and a wood chipper and stuffing them in a crevice under the basement floor at the time. (NSA Database, here I come!)<br /><br />So I hear about how some people I knew back in the day still have negative feelings toward me because of the past. The vicious things I probably said, the attitude I conveyed, the social antagonism all contribute to the great pool of reasons to hate yours truly.<br /><br />All I can do is repair the damage and reconstruct the tattered, shredded remains of previous relationships. I am grateful that high school has introduced me to such a variety of wonderful people (as well as a few not-so-wonderful people) from a number of different schools. From this new canvas, I'm able to paint a much more dignified portrait of myself. <br /><br />Right now is a really good time to ask myself, "Who am I?"<br /><br />Have I just been lying to myself for the past two years, pretending to be someone I'm not? Maybe in the beginning... But, now I can't tell. <br /><br />I've become who I wanted to become. So now I'm in a good place, and I'm happy about that.<br /><br />Now I must strive to never let go of the position I am in, and aim to forward myself.
