Hey blog thing....yah, I'm not hyper, not happy, trying to smile. I guess this all started on Wednesday. Charlene came over earlier than expected so I had no time for work on things I really wanted to do. All she wanted was to play games and run around and around. Yeah, I adjusted pretty quick, so it was ok, but Thursday, Thanksgiving, was a total bummer. Everyone drank themselves stupid, and I found out Charlene doesn't like it either. In an act of petty defiance, I ate alone and didn't socialize very much. It wasn't a lot of fun, but Charlene bonded a bit I guess. We talked and had hot coco late at night. But, last night, Saturday, was probably the worst thing in the world. It was Kurt's 40th birthday, lots of fun in that aspect, yet they were drinking. They started off slow, so I didn't think too much of it, but then the party started. Kurt's son, Kurt Jr., his 2 friends, one of his friend's girlfriends, and Kurt Jr.'s little kids came. The little kids' names are Jc (the little girl) and Ryan (the little boy). What really ticked me off, was that their parents just dropped them off upstairs for Charlene and Me to take care of! Didn't pay them any attention, check up on them, nothing! The kids ended up getting wired on candy and pop and wouldn't settle down until I threatened with time outs. All the 'partiers' were drunk except one of Kurt Jr's friends, who was the designated driver for that little group. Without Charlene, I know I would have cracked, I was near my limit. We watched them till 1 o'clock in the freakin' morning! And what do I have to show for this? One, measly, stupid, little dollar bill! The only good thing, my nice little reward? Mom and Kurt aren't going to drink like that ever again, my Mom had a hangover, and she hasn't had one in years. I laugh so hard at her, she had jell-o shots that contained straight vodka instead of water. ha, ha, hA! I say, HA! It made me feel better, and I know that's really, really mean, but it just irked me soo much, and it still does! Next time they do that? I'm walking, I'd rather spend the night outside than listen to blaring music till round 2 o'clock in the morning. I feel so bad for my Grandma, no wonder why she's so grumpy... jeesh.
