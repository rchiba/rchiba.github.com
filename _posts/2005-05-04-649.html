I'm trying to make up my mind about what to do. How efficient, right? I mean, if you're going to waste time, why do it while elevating blood pressure and pulling out your hair? Well, I like to waste my time worrying because it helps me plan. I'm planning to do my various essays this weekend and do my english project this weekend. I'm also going to study for finals this weekend, go to a QuizBowl thing, and do an OLC project this weekend. Perhaps this "weekend crunch" isn't such a good idea. I hope I can get it done.<br /><br />Anyways, I have three projects due consecutively next week and it's stressing me out. They are easy, but I like to make myself crazy. I don't know, it's a habit.<br /><br />Devin still owes me 15 dollars so I'm going to have to go to his house with a bat and start doing some damage. Will he ever pay me back? Someday...<br /><br />I can dream can't I?
