Welcome my darlings...<br /><br />I was watching "Stuart Little 2" on public access television (How nice of the government). Stuart (A pathetic little rat) came home with a pathetic injured bird. When Stuart's parents (humans. Yea, I don't get it either) find the pathetic, injured canary, they question the presence of the hawk that almost killed it. The mother of Stuart even suggested calling city hall to protest this presence. <br /><br />These humans are a prime example of human nurturing gone wrong. Obviously, the mother feels for the bird. The mother thinks that the poor, little birdy shouldn't be hurt by the larger bird of prey. Well, here's the deal. Birds of prey are at the top of the food chain. That means birds of prey kill smaller birds. If you disrupt this cycle, bad things happen. Too many little birds in the city means a large bird feces contamination problem. Fungus will start growing on these feces and cause disease.And I haven't mentioned the host of other problems that could plague the city. The more little birds in the city, the lower the quality of life is for everyone. The hawks exist for the sole purpose of killing the smaller birds and reproducing. Stupid mindless and overzealous humans. These are the kind of people who make up the general public, and you know what? I feel terribly disturbed by that notion. Aren't you?
