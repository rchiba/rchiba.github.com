I went to the Kumon center today. I felt pretty confident through the whole day (of course, this is relatively speaking, as I was only feeling a little confident, which is a lot more confident than feeling greatly insecure, which is how I feel ordinarily), but a kid who is about the same age as me comes up to me and asks me to explain to her a math problem that I don't remember how to do. After muttering and dancing around the answer for a few minutes, she finally tells me that I'm worthless and promptly walks away. <b>Worthless?</b> I sure did feel worthless after that little comment, and so I retreated back to the little kids, where I can explain the intricacies of long division and adjectives. <br /><br />After about thirty minutes of feeling sorry for myself while grading papers, I am assigned to help two kindergarteners do their reading worksheets. Teaching one kid how to read is hard enough, but two? Difficult. I couldn't focus attention on anything, because my mind was constantly zipping back and forth, trying to coax words and sentences out of these miniature people. And I don't remember how I was taught to read, so I don't think I taught very well, but I did my best, trying not to just hand out answers, but work on each word syllable by syllable. One of the kids wasn't a native speaker, so the "R" sounds always came out as "L" sounds. It's so difficult to teach the formation of sounds. How do you explain such things?<br /><br />The non-native speaker kid reminded me of myself at that age. Loud, obnoxious, funny, but still serious, with small hints of wit mixed in. He trailed off when he talked, just like I do. Random little bugger too. In the middle of doing his worksheet, he started talking about his bird that he named <i>"birdie"</i>. Apparently, he got it from a local exotic pet store and so far that has been his only pet. <br /><br />I guess he was young enough to not realize how much my social skills suck, so he was very friendly to me. When I walked out the door, he followed me out, and as I pulled out of the parking lot, he waved goodbye to me. I was amazed. <i>"Finally"</i>, I thought to myself, <i>"I've found one kid who doesn't hate my guts."</i> Unfortunately, he may very well be a clone of myself. So, I haven't really succeeded in anything today, besides having my self-esteem kicked down a flight of stairs by someone my age, then having it picked back up by a reading-impaired kindergartener <br /><br />The experience is worth something, right?
