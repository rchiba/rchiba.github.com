I don't have much time because it is past my bedtime (laugh at me while your still standing). I am sleepy and I have to get to sleep for tomorow is school. Average Yo reporting in...
<br />
<br />Anyways, this weekend has been normal. But the spring rush of school projects is coming closer as I speak. The "Invention Convention" is going to start soon and I still don't understand what it is all about. I need to understand. Devin's house was a blast with his near death experience and my attraction to trees (I keep running into those darned things!). He showed me his guitar and I forgot my clarinet at his house. Because of this, he called me a sasquatch (Actually, I called myself a sasquatch after Devin paused trying to match an adjective with my behavior) Anyways, overall, In this weekend I have acomplished nothing at all. Now I feel like a wastrel who is staying up above his bed time to wallow in his self pitty. Anyways, I was reading Popular Science magazine at the public library. It was very entertaining to read (I read it for like an hour). I mean, it had stuff about.... Too much info to explain in my short lifespan. You'll have to read it yourself. Anyways, school is coming and I am happy because I get to do something in life when I go to school. I mean, life isn't that enjoyable when you do nothing at your house and your looked at as a lazy bum by your little sister.

<br />Well, that's my useless weekend. I have to go now and go to sleep for school is aproaching. Whee!
<br />Good Night ;)
