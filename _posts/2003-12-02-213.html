Hey blog-thing....
<br />My mental state seems to be spiraling down at an alarming speed. Yes, I'm keeping up my grades, yes, I am keeping up my smile in the morning and smile at night, and yes, I am not eating what I used to. Already my cheek bones have begun to stick out. In only a about a month, maybe more, maybe less, I have lost a lot of weight. I am happy. But that is not the issue anymore. It seems Angela is sick again, and I am remembering what I have tried so hard to block out. I see images of my past flash before my eyes when they close, and sometimes...even when I wake. I can't stand it, I had thought I pushed it down further, I thought....I guess I was stupid and thought I could stop feeling this hurt. I can not feel, I am not aloud to. I can't feel angry, I can't feel sad, nothing!! So why... why did I slip today, these past few days? Why am I getting angry damn it?! I'm not aloud, never aloud, only aloud to smile.... and if that is so... why did I cry today? To tell you the truth journal, I sat in Sunny's place and cried like a little, stupid, child. A child that I thought died such a long time ago, when  was 8...maybe nine? A child... no, two children. The one who died when I was 8 or 9, and one who died the moment the fighting began. The Moment, I became carefree, and the moment I realized, I couldn't be happy. My soul has fallen and died, and I know, it is not meant to fly with the rest. Why does it hurt. Why do I think of all those summers, those springs, those falls, those winters?! Those moments I caught glimpses of hell? Sunny tells me...she tells me I am brave. So brave. I told her, so many things today. She says I am strong, but I am not. Angela is. All those years... she hid me from the truth, took hits for me as I did her, protected me from the evil in that house. She... she saved me, and sacrificed herself. I am not brave, I am a coward. A dirty, rotten, stinking, coward. It is foolish of me to try to save everyone else, to feel everyone else's emotions, to try and repent for what I have done. It is so foolish.... so foolish!! Mom hates me I think. Just because I don't like anyone touching me, around me. She hates it when I tell her the old me is gone, she doesn't want to let go. And I... I am not to blame. Don is. Don stole my soul from me that night, he took everything. But I? I am the real enemy. I have ruined everything, though they wont admit it. If I hadn't of told, I would have been braver. I would have taken the hit! Not Angela! But instead, Sunny says I was the braver one... but how? How can I be brave when I am to blame. Sunny says its not my fault, but I feel it is. Today, I had a flash back to Halloween, many, many years ago. I remember... she didn't obey. So she was punished. I remember her refusing to wear the witch's uniform... him screaming. I ran outside screaming. I heard a slap? A scream? It is all so blurred... but the feeling is there. It scares me. I can even remember threats. I wonder... had we run away, would we have been hunted down like dogs? I remember...Everything. But yet, everyone says they understand, yet they don't. The pain, the guilt, the lies.... my tender heart... broken. Everything was stolen. I am rambling, yet I have thought many times of death, and Sunny knows this. She says I am brave. I wish this pain in my head would become reality, I want to cut and bleed this time, to make it go away.... But I made a promise to Angela, I promised her I'd never cut, scratch, or harm myself again. And I don't lie, and I hate liars. Never, never again. I wont lie to her, or betray her. She may have continued and lied to me, but I won't. I won't follow the same path. Never again.
