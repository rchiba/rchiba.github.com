Over time, I have discovered that things feel better if one works hard. <br /><br />For one example, I got sick of Blender during the very stagnant, non-working days of winter vacation. Now that I've got projects, speeches, homework, and tests to worry about, the Blender bug has hit me again. Oh my love of rendering comes back to me from the dead. Although I use the tutorials much less now, the book I got for christmas was indeed a good buy. Keyboard shortcuts are a page away, and I've got reference sheets for almost every concept and feature for the program.<br /><br />Today, after hours of modelling, I have created a room with a chair, a desk, a radio, a computer, and a bookshelf. Although it is very primitive when compared to other blenderite creations, it is evident that my skills are advancing. This further excites me to model more. <br /><br />According to my new discovery, the following two months are going to feel euphoric. Build season begins this Monday. This means that from Monday on, I'll be at school more than I will be at home. Returning home at 9pm each day and going to school at 6:30am the next morning will mean that I will be at school for 4 more hours each day than I will be at home. I don't know what to expect at this point. For the most part, I've heard that this hardcore work is very exhausting, but worth it. I've decided to trust my sources for now. Hopefully, they're telling the truth.<br /><br />Unsure about my future workload problems, I've tried to get myself to do all of my vocabulary. Unfortunately, it just isn't getting done due to the rebirth of my obsession with Blender. So, tomorrow morning I will attempt to do more tedious vocabulary. <br /><br />*Note to self: Condemn vocabulary books in future new world order.
