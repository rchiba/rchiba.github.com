Great, I'm starting to recycle old music.<br /><br />Like anyone would actually care, but I'm starting to cycle through old, but hard industrial rock that I was into years ago. The neat thing is that it's still enjoying to listen to. This is the kind of music that angsty teenagers turn on to the highest volume level after locking their door and writing their sixteenth suicide note. <br /><br />This, my music recycling, can be attributed to the fact that I don't have time to make many compilation CD's anymore. Processing through hundreds of harvested songs takes time. Processing involves picking good songs, picking the best out of the good songs, editing them, compressing them, packaging them, sorting them, and burning them. Homework is a drain, and so are extracurricular activities so I've abstained from music compilation for a bit. Perhaps I'll have tomorrow to sort through my vast junkyard of harvested songs.<br /><br />Less about myself, more about your life.<br /><br />Go on, live it.
