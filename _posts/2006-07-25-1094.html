Being at point "X" with family is completely apart with being at the same point "X" with a friend. And things are even more different if I'm alone. I'm being very vague when I say "being... is different". Suppose I look at a painting in an art gallery with a good friend. To me, the painting will separate into different points of interest, and I'll pick out a point to bring up in conversation. The point will differ to accommodate for a given scenario. If we (the friend and I) are being humorous, then I'll pick out a funny point of interest. If we're both in a serious mood, then I'll comment on the symbolic nature of the painting.<br /><br />People always say, <i>"Just be yourself."</i> <br />I ask, <i>"How can you not be yourself?"</i><br />One could counter my question by saying, "<i>You can act different when around certain people, or when in a particular environment."</i><br /><br />But, isn't "acting" as a behavior an indicator of who one really is? One can pull many personality traits from the act of pretending artificial emotions and thoughts. <b>Dishonesty, Malice, Creativity, Shyness, Insecurity</b>. All are possible sources of the false "mask" that people often wear. So, for some people, <i>"being themselves"</i> would essentially be not being one's self. From this, one begins to question the assumed simplicity of personality. We label people in our minds, if only to make it easier for our brains to retain the information. <br /><br />He's annoying. She's friendly. They're dangerous.<br /><br />It's inevitable that someone (or maybe everyone) will be misunderstood. <br /><br />During an outing with some friends two days ago, something insignificant happened that may or may not tie into this mindless rant. After eating diner, we all went to Purdue to hang out. (Part of the reason we went to Purdue was to show Ryan the clapping-squeak circles, and the rest of the reason being our need to get drenched in the fountain.) As we were walking around the campus, I saw a concrete pillar and decided to use my arm to elongate a jump beside it. Sounds like a random action, right? Well, it's not random. There must have been a reason behind it. And these past two days, I've been trying to think of all the possible reasons why I did such a thing. Maybe it was because I wanted attention. Maybe it was because I needed to release a lot of stress and energy. <br /><br />We can only theorize as to the underlying causes of my action. But, surely it was for some reason. <br /><br />The sum of my parts is my whole. So, the many individual personalities I exhibit are, yes, a good bit of "who" I really am, but they are only partial units. I don't see how I could ever consolidate them all into one. I don't see how I could ever be "myself" in all of my entirety. Am I misunderstood or am I misunderstanding everyone else? Or both? Why am I so concerned?
