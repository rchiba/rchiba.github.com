Reading.<br /><br />I've never really enjoyed it all that much. In a general sense, I enjoy it, as it enables me to communicate with those not present at a given moment. More specifically speaking, reading fantasy novels has always bothered me. I enjoy looking at statistics, numbers, graphs, and nonfictional accounts of events and/or ideas, but the only fantasy/fiction book that I've really ever deeply connected to was <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" target="_blank">1984</a></i>. I enjoyed this book thoroughly for the ever-present political satire and fascinating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak" title="Newspeak" target="_blank"></a>. I thought, and still do think, that Newspeak is the neatest thing since sliced bread. It makes so much sense for an all-powerful government to eventually move onto control the language of its people. By reducing the number of words, sentences keep their meaning, yet are more efficient. Without synonyms or metaphors, there would be no confusion in converting the words to a message. Newspeak is a beautiful thing to me. <br /><br />But, then again, the very words I write here in this glob of text could never be so eloquent in Newspeak. <br /><br />And to think of such a society as found in <i>1984</i>, it could make one think for an eternity. If you haven't read the book, I suggest you read it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I must soon stop talking about the books I like, and read books that I don't enjoy so much. <i>Macbeth</i> forlornly calls for me from under my pile of books.<br /><br /><b>Call me crude, but Shakespeare just doesn't appeal to me.</b>
