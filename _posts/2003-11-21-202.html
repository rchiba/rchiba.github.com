Alpha Leader #1 bothered me today.
<br />
<br />She said that when I say that I am stupid or dumb, that makes me a bad person. I don't know why. She said that I was a "Black Cloud". Why can't I just be humble? Can I be humble without some Alpha insulting me? I really disagree with her. What am I supposed to do? Am I suposed to brag? That wouldn't be nice would it?
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to go to the gym soon so I have to stop writing.  Bye;)
