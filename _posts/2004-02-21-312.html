Well, today was less than I expected. I finished my speech. It's a bit too long though.
<br />Average Yo reporting...
<br />Anyways, Devin cancelled our working on our project at his house. He said that he didn't want to. What a great excuse. Anyways, I'm thinking of a way to punish him. I think I will tackle him sometime. My speech is too long. I have vowed to cut it, but I just can't. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, with Devins meek little plans and my degraded morale, today's situation was unfacinating. I'm thinking of getting Toon Boom Studio because I need some thing to work on. I'm too unmotivated.
