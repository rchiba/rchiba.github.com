Rage. Rage against society, rage against work, rage against play, rage against life, rage against death, rage against the conformist, and rage against the nonconformist.<br /><br />It's general rage. The kind of rage that slowly attaches itself to your innards and grows. The kind of rage that drains your energy, while instilling more into a delusional mind. The kind of rage that hinders homework. More specifically, my English homework.<br /><br />Reading the book assigned to me for English and answering the questions sounds easy. It really does. Just reading text, and answering straightforward questions about so-and-so character right? Well, it's not so easy if one is stuck in a mental rut, unable to escape the grasp of one's own troubled mind. Troubled with an unknown anger against something that doesn't exist. Irrational anger against nothing. But, it still frustrates me. I'm not angry at my English homework. I understand why it has to be done. I'm not mad at any person, not mad at an idea or concept, not mad against an institution, or a place, or a even a tangible thing. I have no idea what I'm angry about, but all I know is that I walked into my house an hour ago with the intent to finish my English homework. It's not getting done. I have a math test on Friday too. If I put off my English for another day, I don't think I'll be able to sleep tomorrow. And my Algebra grade was devastated by the last test I took.<br /><br />Ok, it's decided. I'm going to finish my English no matter how late I have to stay up. This means that I may not sleep tonight.<br /><br />Wait, I'm not so angry anymore. No more rage.<br /><br />I guess I was angry at myself the whole time.<br /><br />Figures.
