Today was, lets just say.... interesting...
<br />Anyways, these people came to our school from Dublin, England and sang and danced for us. Freddy and I were thinking... This is the kind of stuff they spend our taxes on!??!?!? But the performance was entertai, no no,.... amusing. Yes, Amusing is the correct word there. The dancing was expecially intricate with moves that were a bit too obscene for those poor 6th and 7th graders. After that, our whole school schedule was SKREWED UP! I hate days where the schedule is messed up. Its all a disorganized jumble of periods, with frantic rushing to get to class... or maybe I'm exagerating. Anyways, on the bus, I had a talk with Meagan, Ryan, and Carebare(Matt Lucasac). We were talking about the next party that Meagan was hosting and then everyone was looking at me funny. I looked back and they said that there was a rather large hair coming out of my nose. Very very embarassing indeed. Luckily I pulled it out, but not before a few laughs. I have no idea why I have released that information to the public, but oh well..
<br />         Besides that, I had to take the science test today even though I missed a day. How inconvenient, I thought. And inconvenient it was. I HOPE i get a good grade. I need to show that science class what I am made of. I will BEATDOWN that science grade and PREVAIL over it's objective dominance. Big words there... BIG WORDS for those people... Those people, lazy humans, who of course use the excuse "I'm not smart so don't use big words" SHUT UP YOU IDIOTS, INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING, LEARN THOSE D*** WORDS!!! Oh well, good thing I dont use much profanity, If I did, I would look just as uncivilzed as my fellow classmates or maybe I should just say... the alpha group. What else is there to record for today??? Oh yes, Shishir has joined the "Kow Krew". I thought up a slogan for halloween. Ok here it is... "The KOW KREW will STALK U!"
<br />Interesting, isn't it...
<br />
<br />Ok, let's see what else I can type and record... Oh yea, thank you SPAMMERS(I know who you are) for subsiding in the pointless, relentless acts of spamming. Ok, I think that is all I can think of for now. I really need a notepad to record my thoughts so I can write them here later. Ok, that is all. TATA;)
