I miss school.
<br />I miss school, and does that make me a nerd? I am fine with being a nerd.
<br />I miss school so much I am going to write about it. My school day is broken into 8 periods. Eight periods of calmness, calamity, and memorization. In these eight periods, a variety of inputs and stimuli are invoked upon me and the results are varied. First period is band. I play the clarinet in band. I think the clarinet section is the only section that actually does good. I don't know why. Trumpets are too loud. Trombones are too soft. Tuba is inaudible. Flutes and oboe are... Actually, the flutes and oboe are very good also. Odd... 
<br />Anyways, my sister is going to sleep and turned to thight off so I decided to turn the monitor off. I am typing without the screen now. 
<br />More about band... Inside contacts have indicated that a few choice individuals cheat and... Well actually, everyone cheats. We have this thing called practice cards that you have to fill out over the week and have your parents sign. Everyone cheats on those things. 
<br />On to second period, I forgot what I had for second period, oh yea, the "special classes". In this second period timeframe, we have different classes that correspond to each quarter of the school year. There are four classes. These consist of "Industrial Technology, Foriegn Language (french for the 8th grade, spanish for the 7th grade), Family and Consumer Sciences( Called FACS or Home Ec.), and art. The new quarter is going to bring FACS for me. I have no idea what they are going to teach this year. All I know is that they promote milk diets. Next is third period, which is math. I am in a "advanced class". It is called algebra. It isn't advanced at all and the class is stereotyped as genius level education. The saddness is that everyone learned algebra in fourth or third grade. It is sad that the "normal" kids are going to have to learn it next year in high school. In math, we have a very colorful teacher. I can't give names or anything, but he makes up alot of nicknames, especially for me. I am called eskim-yo, stampey, and Kow. Who knows what my math teacher will think up next. I could write a book about my math teacher, but I can't with my time restraints. Plus, it's ten at night. Maybe I should write about school later because if I continually wrote about school constantly, it would take up the whole webpage. I got to third period and I have a huge paragraph. Wait untill I get to lunch. I get most of my ingenius/depressed/angry/philosophical thoughts right before lunch. I forget them after I eat my food though. Ahh, the saddness of human minds. Anyways, you can kind of tell that I miss school. Once I get there, I know something wrong will happen. I am a klutz. Last year durring winter, I slipped on the ice in front of the school. Another day I got stuck on the bus door. The bus driver closed the door while I was walking through it. Odd huh?
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have passed these maladies alive, so why complain. Well, I don't care if no ones reading this because these writings are for my own records. I only put it on the internet to give people the oportunity to read about my thoughts. Well, I have to go to sleep. Bye people of America/Earth! I will see you tomorow, that is if a meteor doesn't crush the Earth.

<br />Seeya ;)
