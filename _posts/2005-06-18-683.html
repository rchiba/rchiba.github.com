I'm supposed to be going to sleep earlier. It's part of my summer initiative to get more rest. Unfortunately, I get too caught up in a GIMP tutorial, email, music, a starfox forum, or a combination of the aforementioned events. It's late now, and in two days, I'll be in class. I'm supposed to finish some driving worksheets to help myself study. That isn't happening is it?<br /><br />On a positive note, I've learned how to selectively color in GIMP. This lets me color only certain parts of the picture and leave the rest in B&W. It's quite artsy and I like it. <br /><br />There's a large celebration my town is celebrating called, "The Taste of Tippecanoe" and I assume that all of the "in" people as well as "out" people are there mingling with one another. I'm not there. I suppose I'm some kind of social outcast. <br /><br />You know, I've always thought of jail as a bit romantic. Every good romance/drama has a bit of prison in it. The gruffy inmates, the smelly cells, the dusty concrete blocks, and the razor ribbon make the whole scene so... catchy. Heh, I made a pun. If I ever have to go to jail, I'm glad that I'll be optimistic about it. <br /><br />Voltaire, such a great guy, albiet French. He said, "Common sense is not so common." which I can relate to. It's funny that it only takes a six word quote to relate two people from different continents from different centuries together. Words, beautiful things, no?
