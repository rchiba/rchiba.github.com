I went to summer school, went to QuizBowl, went to Kumon Learning Center, went to robotics, went home, and then realized that I lost my handheld device and accidentally took a nametag from Kumon. I was planning on going to sleep early, but I spent the last two hours trying to load some stupid FPS that I shouldn't have even considered looking at. It's riff-raff, and I was naive enough to go all-out and find all the .dll's and all the other crap, only to find that it still doesn't run. Trash, it's trash that's not worth spending time on, some stupid idiotic game. I should have learned from years of downloading crap, by I didn't, and so I pay by staying up so late and going to school tomorrow with a headache. I hate waking up now, because it's so hard, painful, each late night increases the difficulty. It's the murky confusion and drowsyness that's the hardest to get rid of. Throughout the day it never leaves, it just flows in waves, occasionally slowing to a trickle, then washing me away to stupor in other hours.<br /><br />Working with little kids is hard. Working with little kids who don't know English is even harder. It's hard to explain grammar when one has no common language with another. I felt helpless.<br /><br />At the robotics meeting, we talked about keeping our fledgling team alive. Some key players are choosing to jump ship, and the rest of us are stuck leaderless and without the funds to make do. The West Lafayette team head honcho, Flo, has been very generous, and the team is very grateful. With the ousting of our previous robotics sponsor/teacher/commander/coach, we are all both happy and worried. Without a faculty member, a team simply cannot survive. But, robotics has a very intense time and monetary commitment attached to it. Like a giant concrete boulder, it can weigh you down and crush you to death. Robotics isn't even a school-sanctioned activity yet, which is a real shame. I really want to do (and teach) animation things for next robotics season, but it won't be happening if the team has no faculty member to tie the whole thing together. <br /><br />With the whole AP Chemistry + Honors Physics thing going on, Robotics will be a great hurdle to overcome, but if it stays there, I'll surely join, I have no choice but to. <br /><br />In the mean time, all I can do is worry about the future, and dwell on the past. Never to focus on a present that seems constantly ethereal.
