Why do people play instruments anyways. <br /><br />Everyone should become a robot and live in a fabricated world with nothing to motivate them, but nothing to neagate their tasks, not like these robots had minds anyways. Or not.<br /><br />Back to the instruments thing. Well, what I'm trying to do is justify the fact that I did not pick up my clarinet and practice my music, like I was "supposed" to do for today. It's pretty sad that I try to justify my procrastination by writing about it. I mean, most people just do it. They have guts. I have to go out and complain and whine about it to myself to get myself to feel better. It's absolutely disgusting. <br /><br />About the instruments. People try to make music, but why make music when you can just let others make it for you. It's not like I'm going to make a living from playing my clarinet. It's not like I derive any pleasure from playing it either. Then, you're probably wondering why even continue band. Well, I'm just trying to justify the purchase of my expensive clarinet. The thing is, I just can't let something so expensive go so easily. I hate playing, I hate being worse than everyone else, I hate practicing, I would hate to let the money go to waste, so I trudge along, trying to justify the existance of my clarinet. <br /><br />My clarinet rules my world. It's not fun.
