Today sucked majorly until I got on the Internet. Wanna know WHY today sucked Mr. Blog-thing? I'll tell you. Because I, Amanda, am not considered anybody, not even human! It is stated in the declaration of Independence that ALL our endowed by there creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This document ALSO states that all men (meaning mankind) have been created equal! So WHY am I not considered equal with everyone else? Why am I considered a lesbian JUST because my ear is pierced? Why am I considered 'not aloud to cuss and express anger?! WHY AM I CONSIDERED A FREAKING BAD ROLE MODEL IF AND WHEN I DO CUSS OR EXPRESS MY ANGER JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON???!!!
<br />I ask you readers, in calm, cool, and totally NOT angry way.... WHY I can't be considered equal with every other person? I also ask you why we consider others to be nonentities, nobodies, and losers, while a certain social status portrays what you HAVE to be??!! 
<br />Here's a "Fun Fact" of the day! Wanna know WHY my sister is in the hospital? Because people like you stupid, ignorant, overly narcissistic 'popular' kids screamed, yelled, and taunted her, just because she grew faster and was different. You told her she was fat, a looser, a nobody and said she smelled (she took showers every day). You drove her so far the edge, and then her father and her older sister did it to. Wanna know what happened all you jerks, 'populars' and, wanna be's????!! She was dumped in the mental hospital time and fashion forgot and forced to be ridiculed even there. Wanna know what's happening now?! She's fricken' anorexic! Let's see how tall y'all are now, standing on your phony sense of security just because you have words to hurt people, to make them feel worthless. 
<br />Oh, and Chelsey.... I CUSSED! I CUSSED DAMN IT I CUSSED! Now I can be just like you! So go shove your finger up your ass, sit on it, and spin! You too Brittany!
<br />I'm tired, and wanna know why?
<br />1. I lost everything at age 9
<br />2. My sister hated me for a year, we didn't talked for that year and we rarely got to see each other
<br />3. I suffered a breakdown, I scratched
<br />4. I went to court, was ordered to see my 'attacker'
<br />5.Have to see my attacker once a week
<br />6. Survive to sessions and scratch myself
<br />7. My best friend dies
<br />8. Ordered to see my attacker once a month

<br />I've been through heaven and then put into h*ll. How brave do you feel, laughing at me just because I can't handle what even an adult can't handle? How do you feel? Bad? Good? Smug? I don't care. I just don't care.
<br />I don't mean to be dramatic, but where are you at the end of the day? Do you still have friends, real ones? Or are you enshrouded in the darkness of fake friends and false reality? Are you even alive inside, or are you trying to find yourself all over?
<br />The trouble with humans is that most of them don't think before they act. We are all guilty of it at one or more points in our lives.
<br />
<br />"We walk in the shadows,
<br />and cry through the night,
<br />We long to take up wing,
<br />and join everyone in flight"
<br />
<br />"But alas our wings are folded,
<br />and shriveled up so small,
<br />and no matter how we try to fall,
<br />the result is always to fall"
<br />
<br />"No one sees up trying,
<br />all they see is a smile,
<br />but inside we are crying,
<br />and shoutin' all the while"
<br />
<br />"We are the children without wings,
<br />unable to fly and soar,
<br />longing to pick up the knife,
<br />and never to live no more."
<br />
<br />I feel I am entitled to a rant, a prayer, a curse and occasional bouts of vulgarity. Poems like these, written for friends... it is a glimpse at me. I donâ€™t care if you report me to Mrs. Kerr. She already knows. Enjoy while you can. Always, remember;
<br />
<br /><em>Don't dance to slow,
<br />don't dance to fast.
<br />because you'll never know,
<br />how long the song will last.</em>
