Hello everyone (or anyone),
<br />Anyways, today was a good day, besides my death threats and insults from shishir. No homework, and the skies are clear.  The name I shall not mention is still being a prick in social studies, wasting my life. I have started to compile my list of pointless topics, alexi...name i shall not mention has brought up. So far, she has wasted about an hour of my life, or more! I am not sure. And also... things have not been going smoothly in Industrial Technology. Everyone is confused, including the "president" shishir. Kyle is still jumping on my back and attacking me with his "Jap Jokes". He is such a cruel person. I cannot believe that I am friends of these people of little intellect. They will see how much I matter someday... These people put me down. Oh yea, another one for my black list is Trent. Well, I think thats all, for much has angered me. Maybe I dont have an open mind. They say I take everything to seriously, maybe I do, maybe I dont. Its a mystery shrouded in a black cloud of fury and teenage horemones. Mysterious things I tell ya... Mysterious things.....
