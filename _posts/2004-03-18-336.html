I'm so annoyed with myself. I can't believe I've let this happen! What may you ask blog-thing? I'll tell you! I have let my walls weaken and now I am getting sick. My head is stuffy and my throat is scratchy. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I feel so bitter right now.... ugh! 
<br />My day has been fine. I slept in my room (finally) about two nights ago. No, I'm still not over the movie. Go on, laugh. I'll cough on you and then we'll see who's laughing.
<br />See? Irritable....
