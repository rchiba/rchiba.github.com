I believe that I can safely say that my biological clock has been trained correctly, to correspond with my "wake-up early" initiative I started awhile ago. <br /><br />By setting my alarm to play NPR early in the morning, I have trained my mind to wake me up a few seconds before the alarm goes off, so I can enjoy the morning news. I tested myself this morning by turning off the alarm function on my bedside clock. To my delight, I woke up a few minutes before the designated awakening time, and managed to push the "on" button that resides on the clock, manually triggering my alarm to wake me up. This was quite an accomplishment, as now I can breathe easier, knowing that if my alarm fails, my mind will not.<br /><br />I am anticipating great chaos and homework-filled agony tomorrow, as I will have a QuizBowl meet that will last much too long for my tastes. Hopefully, I'll repress my tendancy to have a nervous breakdown in the face of homework that does not make sense to me.<br /><br />The only thing I can do now is wait and hope for the worst, as I often do.
