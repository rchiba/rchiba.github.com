I've said it a million times before, and I might as well say it again.<br /><br />There's nothing like QuizBowl practice to make you feel suicidal, and like a fool.<br /><br />Questions, questions, questions. Questions that I can't answer. Questions that other people can answer. With each passing question, hope is diminished. In the end, dwindling to nothing. Hopeless. That's how it is, and there's nothing I can do about it. Some people are just better than others. I'm pretty much a failure in that aspect of life.<br /><br />So, I came home today from today's notoriously degrading QuizBowl practice only to be told by my mother that the volunteer position that I wanted can only be filled by people who are 18 and older. This was a fantastic way to start off my journey home, journey through my homework, and my journey here. It should be noted that the previous sentence was sarcastic. <br /><br />I get home and drag my idiotic self to my room, upon which I shut the door, grab my chemistry worksheets and such, collapse on the floor, and begin to complete these problems. I promptly, but unknowingly, fall asleep. Two hours later, it's seven in the afternoon, and I'm conscripted to mow the lawn. So, I do.<br /><br />The lawn mower has been having issues cutting grass, so if the deed is not done often, the grass clumps up and makes the lawn look like a WWII era battlefield, with random chunks, rips, and tears in the grass.<br /><br />Mowing the lawn is so relaxing. There wouldn't be an easier job in the world. It's mindless, it's simple, and it's comforting. The drone of the engine turns life into nothing more than a path of grass waiting to be cut to shreds. The smell of gasoline reminds me of carefree places from my past. <br /><br />A few hundred bumps, and thousands of blades of grass later, I'm done with my thoughtless chore that amazingly consumed only an hour of my time. Back to the room, back to the tedious tasks that drive the daily events that surround my generally mundane life. Back to the papers, back to the pencil, back to the keyboard. Back to the future? I think not.<b> But, surely not back to the past. </b><br /><br />The past was never this frazzled.
