<i>Equally hazardous to park visitors is the PeopleMover. Hurtling through the sterile corporate future of Tomorrowland at a speed of two miles per hour, it is plainly a menace to the life and limb of every guest. Less than two months after its opening, it mutilated and killed its first victim. In August of 1967, Rick Yuma, a 15-year old boy from Hawthorne, innocently attempted to change cars as the PeopleMover passed through a tunnel. Unfortunately, he slipped and, as the papers reported, was "found wedged between two cars with his head and the upper part of his body crushed". And "wedged" was the word for it; Disney "Imagineers" negligently hadn't forseen this possibility and made allowances for it in their design. Workers had to dismantle the train in order to extricate the boy's mangled remains...<br /><br />...Park guests aren't the only ones seduced to their deaths by the park's attractions. Consider the late, lamented "America Sings". It was seemingly designed strictly as a hazard to employees. Converted from the old General Electric Carousel of Progress, it featured six theaters revolving around a four part fixed stage of Disney audioanimatronic animal figures performing well-loved American songs. Even before its official 1974 opening, there was something sinister about this android musical spectacular. The tragedy to come was foreshadowed at the press preview party, when one of the attraction's designers fell into a pit and sustained slight injuries. <br /><br />Disneyland ignored this omen, and opened "America Sings" to the public at the end of June. This decision would cost them the life of an innocent young hostess, the first Disneyland employee killed in the line of duty. <br /><br />Deborah Stone had just graduated from nearby Santa Ana High. In many ways, she epitomized the crisp, clean all-American image encouraged among park employees. She edited her high school year book, belonged to the honor society and capped her high school career by winning the principal's award for "outstanding service to her school and community". Undoubtedly, she breezed through her coursework at the Disneyland University. <br /><br />Yes, she had nothing but a bright future full of promise to look forward to on that tragic July night. There were no witnesses to her agonizing end, no spectacular fall or dramatic search. Around 11 PM, fellow employees noticed her missing from her post greeting guests. After a brief search, they found her crushed remains. As the theaters rotated about the fixed inner stage, she had been caught between a stationary wall and a moving wall. The attraction smashed her like a steamroller running over one of Disney's beloved characters in a hilarious act of animated mayhem. Except this was no cartoon, and there would be no animated sleight of hand to "uncrush" her. America Sings was closed for three days until a system of warning lights could be installed. But for one young hostess, it was a little too late.</i> <a href="http://tafkac.org/death/disney_deaths.html" title="Disney Deaths" target="_blank">[LINK]</a><br /><br />What a horrible way to die. <br /><br />Life seems so valuable, but after seeing people die in such an absurd place, I'm sure it changes perspectives. <br /><br />On the topic of depressing things, I'm glad I didn't go to Challenge Day this week. Truthfully, I would have cried. Better to force the bad things out of memory. For the good of yourself and others.
