I found and interesting site. I will now list my fears for you. lol;
<br />Aichmophobia or Belonephobia.
<br />Gephyrophobia
<br />Dentophobia
<br />Odontophobia
<br />Iatrophobia
<br />Lilapsophobia
<br />Trypanophobia
<br />Brontophobia
<br />Lilapsophobia
<br />Aphenphosmphobia, Haphephobia or Haptephobia or Chiraptophobia
<br />Yes, how much fun. I also found out the fear of long words (Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia) is the longest word in the world I believe ^_^ Isn't that ironic? Oh the cruel irony is so much fun to me right now. I've just finished part one of my novel and I am waiting on my editor to finish checking it over... I feel so impatient. 
<br />anyway, part two is on the way. Yay? It is hard, and I do mean HARD! I have to have the right type of music playing to stimulate my mind... ah the beauty of piano ^_^ Talk later!
