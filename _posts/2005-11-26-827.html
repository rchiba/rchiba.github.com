I walk into the bookstore.<br /><br />It's a chain, so there's no artsy-fartsy social antagonism going on. There is no snazzy jazz music, no roundtable discussions between literature aficionados. There's no fear, because in chain stores, security is guaranteed, service is promised, and there is nothing to get excited about, everything's the same in every store.<br /><br />That's what I thought.<br /><br />Through the rows of CDs I walk, and I catch a familiar noise. Nonchalantly stopping and turning toward the CDs, attempting to look inconspicuous, I listen in, trying to figure out what the sound was, and where it was coming from. I think hard, and the sound comes back, from the right, about two rows of CDs between me and the audio source. And then I identify the noise as the sound of someone speaking.<br /><br />It's so familiar, like a tune one can recognize from afar, the kind of tone that is as familiar as one's own home. This person keeps talking, and slowly, I come to the conclusion that it is someone I know, a female.<br /><br />I don't believe myself. She couldn't be here, not her. But, I keep thinking, and I reason out that the chances of her being at this store in particular at this time of day, about 6pm, are very high, as she lives very near to this bookstore. <br /><br />My hands begin to swell, sweat with panic, my heart beats like an angry techie bashing the brains out of his Motorola cell phone (take that, biznatch Motorola people. Hello Moto this!). My mind races in circles, trying to grasp the situation. <br /><br />And now, as I think back, I don't understand why I got so excited at something so mundane. After all, she practially lives in the store (geographically). It's nothing amazing to see her. But, for some reason, my mind went nuts, and although I currently don't get why, it still happened the way it happened.<br /><br />Back to the CD shelves. There's a crack between the rows of CDs. The voice gets closer and closer. I try to move myself, to run away, hide in the computer-book section. My feet don't move, and all I can do is stare into that crack between the row of CDs like a deer. <br /><br />For an instant, a split second, the world stops. Time stops, and nothing moves. She looks streight at me, or appears to. I freeze, and the world around me freezes, and she freezes. We're frozen. The world spins around in circles, and finally time thaws itself into a lukewarm mush. <br /><br />She doesn't notice me. I sigh a relieved sigh and trot back to my homeland, the computer-book section to plan my next course of action. On my way, I stop and turn back. Out of curiosity, I peek into the row she's in. My heart races again, and I like it. She still doesn't seem to see me. For a few seconds, I try to focus, but I can't.<br /><br />I get the odd idea to run past her in the row to see if she will notice me. Thinking back, it was completely pointless, and I don't understand why I was so excited by this sneaking. I must be some sick freak.<br /><br />But, I hold my breath, run past, rush through the row, and trot back to my hiding place. My head is pounding. A natural high rushes through my body. I run back to the row, and peek into the row she's in and see that she hasn't noticed me. <br /><br />For the next 15 minutes, I facinate myself by seeing how many times I can come into her field of vision unnoticed. She never notices.<br /><br />And I go home confused, having hid from someone that I talk to every day at school.
