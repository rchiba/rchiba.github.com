As an 'esample, I've decided t'"dialectize" mah' post today. Slap mah fro! ah' dun did dis by usin' de "dialectizer" link t'yo' left. Man! Try it out. Man! Anyways, today wuz fine standard. De point ah' wanna make today be dis. ah' still hate da damn stupid "Orientashun t'Life and Careers" class. We is watchin' movies which gots hardly nuthin t'do wid careers and da damn wo'k fo'ce. Any info'mashun dey cut is eida' obvious o' outdated. Do we truly need t'be taught dat we need t'be clean and diggin' hot t'make some baaaad fust impression? If Indiana's ya'd needs dis primitive kind'a instrucshun, dese ya'd gots'ta be incredibly. Slap mah fro!.. slow, so cut me some slack, Jack. And da damn scary doodad be dat da damn ya'd uh Indiana probably duz need dese skills.<br /><br /> Anyways, ah' sold all uh my fundraisin' kindy. Slap mah fro! De profits go t'QuizBowl. It's quite rediculous, ah' mean, de kindy be ho'rible and overpriced. You's dig sick uh it afta' de 4d lick, and dey're shaped likes some brain. 'S coo', bro. It's some wonda' dat Zach actually bought dree. I'm still amazed dat everyone bought one. ah' gots'ta be movin' mah' way down de social ladda' o' sump'n. Quite possibly. <br /><br />Slap mah fro!.. I still hate Ipods. I'm so's incredibly full uh rage against Ipods. ah' plum hate dem. WORD! If ya' wuz carryin' one, it would make some baaaad fust impression uh ya' t'me. It would show dat ya' wuz ripped off fo' sump'n purely vain. 'S coo', bro. If ya' gots bought an Ipod, shame on ya'. If ya' gotsn't, join me in mah' quest t'ban Ipods fum society! Right on! <br /><br />Also, ah' would likes t'menshun dat "Peace Out" be not fum Mr. Ah be baaad... Rice o' anoda' sucka'. "Peace Out" be an 'espression likes "Chill, Homie G" and be not "owned" by any one sucka'. Snatch dat Ryan. 'S coo', bro.
