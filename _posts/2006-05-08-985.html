This afternoon, I felt really stupid.<br /><br />Not really stupid, but just plain worthless. For the first time in months, I finished my homework with lots of time to spare this afternoon. Because this hasn't happened to me in a long time, I felt lost, as if I couldn't remember what I <i>used</i> to do, back in the day where I had lots of time. I just sat in my chair, staring at my hand, then flipping through my binder to see if I had missed some homework. <br /><br />The initial feeling was one of relief. Relaxation. Not so, my dear.<br /><br />The relief feeling lasted about thirty seconds. Then I was left to figure out what I was supposed to do with the extra time. Games didn't sound productive enough. My creativity was burnt out from lack of sleep. My room was already cleaned out and sprayed down. I had already read all of the books on my shelf.  There was just nothing to do that made sense to me. I had to do something productive. <b>Just had to.</b><br /><br />So, I slept. I figured that I might as repay my sleep debt. I got up from my chair, walked a grueling three steps, curled up in bed, and promptly knocked myself out. Three and a half hours pass. I wake up, and the sun is still shining. It's 7:30PM, and my mind is a big slurry of jumbled thoughts and ideas. The little plastic trinket attached to the dongle that is attached to the light that is attached to the fan, that little plastic trinket swings back and forth, as air from an unknown source moves it around. It taunts me to wake up, and so I do. The room is musty, dusty, but 99.99% sterile, or so the canister of Lysol tells me. Trying to escape from my post-sleep mental melange, I journey out of my room, down the steps, and to the empty dinner table. I get myself a cup of tea and drink it. Unable to come up with anything better to do, I procure and consume another cup of tea.<br /><br />After finishing, I begin to pace around the house, trying to find something interesting to break or fix. I see a bottle of nail polish remover, and old Consumer Reports magazine, and a Swiss Army Knife. None of these things particularly appeal to me. And so, I move on. Over the course of the next half hour, I would come to realize that when faced with a new situation, I respond with curious repose. So carefree, but with each passing minute, I felt worse and worse.<br /><br />Simply, I was not getting anything done. And when I'm not getting anything done, I feel like my life isn't worth living. Even sleeping is better than walking mindlessly around the house looking for things to play with. Even reading <strike>some overrated shitty English play about a Scottish thane's bloody journey to power</strike> Macbeth is better than mindlessly walking around the house!<br /><br />But, eventually I found a source of entertainment, but rather fulfillment of my need to <b>do</b> something.<br /><br />My old Olympus Camedia D-380 camera. It was top of the line, back in the day. Weighing in at around 2.0 megapixels, its 199$ street retail price was a value back in '02. I'm very sentimental about this camera. It's been across the world twice with me, and has been in my pocket in plenty of senic locales, social occasions, holidays, as well as awkward moments with relatives. The thing is as tough as a brick, and as light as, well... a brick-sized hunk of plastic.<br /><br />And for the sake of bringing life back to this retired old friend, I charged up some batteries and fired it up. It still takes pictures, just like the day I bought it!<br /><br />As you can see, there is a picture below this post. I'm thinking about posting a picture a day, just to make things interesting, more visual, and perhaps more appealing to the readers and future readers of this blog. You know what they say,<br /><br /><b>"A picture is worth about 20 blog posts".</b>
