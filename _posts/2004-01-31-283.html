It's been so very long since I have updated this journal. For that I apologize. You know, lots of things have been happening as of late. One of those things is something I haven't seen at all in life, so I'm confused. I know this is going to sound really stupid, so be forewarned, but never in my life have I seen two people love each other. I know, laugh at me, go on, I know you want to, but it's true! I wasn't born when my mother got married to Frank, but from what I've heard it was a young love, and therefore failed. Then, when my mom married Don...Well....Let's just say because of that marriage I'm here, but also because of it, I didn't have a good childhood. Then there was Jerry. I used to like him, until I realized WHAT he was using my mom for. In many aspects he had enlisted her as his slave while he cheated on her! I remember her going to him at beck and call. At least, until she finally figured out, and pardon this, but he was a (bleeeeeeeep)! Anyway, here comes Kurt. It's just so weird to call him Dad, I guess I'm just not ready yet but anyway, here he comes. A perfect example of a fairytale knight rescuing a damsel in distress. I guess they hit off at an instant, even though Helen DID meddle a bit to get them together...heh. But anyway, as I watch and document their relationship in my mind, it is hard to realize that that is love. I guess it's because I haven't really seen something like it before. The way they look at each other, the way they act. They haven't even fought yet! They worry over each other for no reason, and when they lived apart from each other, the phones would be constantly ringing because they missed each other so much. It's shocking. I wonder, do everyone else's parents do this? When I was little, I thought it might be normal for the children and mother to cry themselves to sleep on the couch. Maybe every one was like this, ya know? But I guess I've come to realize that wasn't normal, that sometimes happiness comes after a long spell of hardship. Maybe that's why I'm beginning to admire my mother so much. Because she can stand up to Angela and I couldn't. For that I beat myself up. The only thing I can credit myself for was in the mall, stopping her from buying diet pills because I noticed she was falling behind-near the store that sells the diet pills. 
<br />"Go away!" I remember her hissing at me. I tried to imitate Mom, but I hoped Mom and Charlene would notice us both missing soon. I think it took them five minutes to come back, and I still stopped Angela from buying them, so that made me happy. 
<br />But that seems so minute compared to what Mom did. She stood up to Angela when Angela wanted to kill herself, and I? I just went into a form of shock I guess. I remember too many memories surfacing. Way too many. So many unwanted hands in a way. It was the feeling I get when people get too close to me, only about ten times worse. 
<br />Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get through to Angela. I think every one expects me to start acting like that eight-year-old that, in a way, has died. How fustrating, no one gets that. Maybe that is why inside, I call myself the three souls. That one eight-year-old, down in the deep recesses of my mind locked up with chains. She cries out, wanting to be set free but she is too weak. She is the voice that haunts me and plagues me, and sometimes the voice of reason. 
<br />Then there is the stronger one, up ahead. A cage of light keeps her cornered. She is as mad as a raging wildcat, and much older, stronger, and bigger than any other part of me. She is the voice that screams out in anger, that cries for vengeance. 
<br />And then there is the present, stronger me, in the center. She's quiet, and her eyes are but blank shells. They hold no shine and passion. She, I guess, is the new soul created to hold up the world, like Atlas, in a way. 
<br />I know I sound wither really weird or schizophrenic, but in my eyes it's true. Reason and Anger pull at me everyday and sometimes little bits of them escape. Sometimes they are too hard to control. 
<br /><em>"The Angel and the Demon, 
<br />the Halfbreed in between. 
<br />All of them keep pulling, 
<br />tearing at the seams.
<br />A cage made of light,
<br />A bunch of chains so strong,
<br />A seat in the middle,
<br />to keep them and belong."</em>
<br />Cliche' I know. But it is the best I can do for now, to explain it is futile. I guess it's just weird seeing love. Heh.
