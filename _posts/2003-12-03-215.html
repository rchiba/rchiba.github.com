Today was incredibly dementing.
<br />I found out today that most everyone at school is a hopeless human that will only succeed in co-existing with other humans on this Earth. Sad isn't it. Propaganda and American society have corrupted the masses which will all eventually die an unmarked death.
<br />
<br />The girl behind me in science class still complains constantly and it gets on my nerves. She thinks it is trivial, but I am very annoyed and it prohibits me from thinking sometimes. I decided to take action today. I objected and everyone else pounced on me like a tiger of death. They say I "spaz out". All I want to do is object to the pointless complaining chatter. All that happens is complaining and whining. I just want them to shut the fu***** he** up. That is all that needs to happen to satisfy me. Also, in social studies, the teacher wouldn't give us the notes if we talked. Of course, I am in the retard class and everyone just talks because they are so idealistic and corrupted. I wanted the notes very badly for the bell was approaching fast. I objected and people said I "spazed out". I want them to know that I am entitled to my expressions too and that they should shut the ...... just shut up.
<br />
<br />Also, earlier in the day, I concluded that Americans are addicted and driven to die with a very common drug called caffine. This drugs widespread use has gone too far. My foreign language teacher even used it to bribe children with it. I hold a candy in my hand, and these people (obviously driven by their addiction and corrupted society) crawl up to me like druggies, everyone wanting a piece. But of course, why should I object. Without fools like this, doctors would be out of buissiness and my dad is a doctor. I just think it is sad for people to be this low.
<br />
<br />I just say, go on and die already....
