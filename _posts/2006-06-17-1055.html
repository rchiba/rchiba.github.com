The events of today:<br /><br />>>Tirelessly cleaned the pool with much disgust.<br />>>Came home and took a nap.<br />>>Woke up and met up with friend.<br />>>Went to large store with said friend to buy cheap DVDs.<br />>>Sat in front of television and watched a movie.<br />>>Typed up this pathetic post.<br /><br />I don't have the luxury (sarcasm denoted) of sitting in my room and feeling sorry for myself, so excuse me for the lack of my depressed and/or melancholy rantings.
