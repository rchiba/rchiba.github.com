Behind the counter, in a tidy arrangement, they sit. Something that has been five years in the making. Twelve of them, neatly stacked in the corner. Boxes of white printed with grey, sans-serif text, the Mac-esque marketing campaign that just oozes with hipness. The man in the store outfit leans over and puts one of them in a plastic bag. A crowd of about twenty pasty college students mingle under cardboard cutouts of green-shirted elven swordsmen, exploding cars, and British spies. <br /><br />The plastic bag reaches the top of the counter. A credit card is scanned, <span style="font-style:italic;">blip</span>. Someone starts counting down, and the rest join. "<span style="font-style:italic;">Ten seconds before midnight!</span>", someone yells.<br /><br />We stand behind the counter, away from the crowd, staring forlornly at the pile of modular treasures. If only, if only...<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"THREE, TWO, ONE, WIIIIIIII!!!"</span><br /><br />And with that said, a new era begins. Transactions flood the cashier, and the group of coveted game consoles escape in the arms of eager fanboys and fangirls.<br /><br />We stand at the door, spending the remainder of our time wishing that we could be them, and they could be us.
