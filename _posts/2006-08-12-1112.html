My <i>Starfox Adventures</i> video game came in the mail today. I played it for an hour or so, but stopped when I realized that I had to mow the lawn. The rest of the day, I did mundane chores to fill up time. I never got back to the game. And now I'm here, awake an hour later than I planned to be. My newly bought video game brings into question how I use my time for entertainment.<br /><br />I've been meaning to study for the past week, it just hasn't happened. It's all my fault that things have turned out the way they have, but I can't change the past, and I'm too weak to change the present.<br /><br />At the moment, I'm typing words to be displayed on my blog, not pouring over lists of French verbs or reading Grapes of Wrath. This isn't productivity. Productivity would be putting into long-term memory important information. My parents commented on how hard school is in Japan. What kind of lazy, stupid slob am I to be doing so little when I have the opportunity to do so much?<br /><br />It's getting closer, closer, so closer to 11PM, and it makes me angry. <br /><br />But, I might be doing something with Tiffany tomorrow, so that takes my anger away and turns it into bubbly nothingness.<br /><br />Going to sleep now. Seems like the most productive thing I can do right now.
