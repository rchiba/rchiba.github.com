I just want to send a shoutout to yours truly, ALEXIA-STIENWEG WOODS!
<br />
<br />I don't hate you. I can't mention names can I? Child protection laws and such. I might as well make up a name and that is what I named you. I do not hate you. I do not have a devout hatred for you. What if that person was just another person. Maybe a figment of my immaginations. The one thing I have that Shishir has not crushed into tiny bits is my opinions. I protect them, and yiou are threatening them. Why do you hate me? I don't hate you. Trust me, if I hated you as much as you think I do, there wouldn't be a sane thing written on my website. Why are you on my website anyways? You are the one who choses to go to my website and consequently, you choose to look at my writings. DO NOT look at them if you will and misunderstand them. I have already heard from various sources what I have "supposedly" said to you. These accusations are truly and wrongfully false. Maybe I am a bit angry at you. You know why? It is like your against me. You bend my words like paper clips. And with those bent paper clips, you stab me in the eye. I only hate you when you bend your words like that. Now everyone believes you exaggerated stories and accusations about me. Thank you for destroying my life, but I still do not hate you. Why do you torture me like this. I do not hate you and I don't care what you think. I control my hatred for people and you don't so that is the reason you shouldn't be gossiping to EVERYONE about how you hate me. Maybe this is a huge misunderstanding or something, but it is really ticking me off. Sorry mr. Rice about this ranting buffonery but I need to clear this up once and for all. Please do not believe everyone you here because they probably twist the story a billion times before it gets to you. I do not hate you Alexia. And what's wrong with your name? Maybe I should call you Bob. I respect your privacy and that is what I named you what I did. Now, is that a sign of hatred? If I really hated you as much as you think I do, would I really protect your privacy? I think not!
