Oh the golden ages of cartoons.<br /><br />A few year back, we had Ren & Stimpy, Rocko's Modern Life, Swat Kats, and Captain Planet.<br /><br />When I think back to all of those cartoons, one sticks out in my mind. Captain Planet was the most messed up show ever created.<br /><br />There were obvious flaws in Captain Planet's theories and objectives. If everyone was to obey him and become his eco-slaves, then world economies would collapse, thousands more poverty stricken third world country residents would starve to death, and the societies and civilizations would collapse. Think about if we all decided to not to pollute for one day. Power plants would shut down, and life-sustaining electricity would evaporate away. Motors would churn to their silent stop. Life would halt, and people in hospitals, elevators, and the south and north would all be in risk of dying. Without pumps, there would be no water. Without electricity, there would be no respirators. Without pollution, we, as a civilization, would not be able to function. The people, deprived of their bells and whistles would revolt, society would collapse. A revolution would take place, and casualties would be in the hundreds of thousands. The end result would be a battlefield/wasteland of dead corpses and silent machinery. <br /><br />Captain Planet and his Planeteers should be labeled as terrorists. <br /><br />And what's with Ma-Ti, anyways? He's that South American Planeteer that has the power of "heart." Heart!? What kind of power is that? Somehow, his heart, a muscle used to push blood throughout the body, was able to telepathically send messages and tame animals. His power should be called, "Freakishly distorted anatomy from South America." Or, "Fight Badies with Cardiac Muscle." Or alternatively, "Freak, stoner-hippie from South America." Let me give you a picture of this dastardly absurd kid. Pft.<br /><br /><img SRC="http://www.turner.com/planet/static/graphics/ma-ti.gif"><br />This is Ma-Ti. He has the power of heart.
