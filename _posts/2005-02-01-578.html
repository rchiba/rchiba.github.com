I remember, I remember....
<br />
<br />Wait, no I don't. I had such a great witty parody of a common saying that I wanted to present, but unfortunately, my memory is fading. I assume it is because I don't want to remember what happened today. I am protecting myself by erasing my own memory. I don't think I erased my memory for something very traumatic. I think I erased my own memory because I find the things I supposedly "learn" in some of my classes pointless. The "Orientation to Live and Careers" class is a prime example. I "learned" how to read "better". All she did was point out that you should actually read the things that you study for. Give me a break. No duh, you have to actually read the things that you want to learn. What, now the state of Indiana has to tell me how to "study"!? How absurd!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am being harsh at the OLC teacher and the state of Indiana, since there are some "less talented" people who don't know how to study. I have no idea how they even get through life without learning and studying, but that's beside the point. 
<br />
<br />The point is that OLC is still on the "I HATE THIS CLASS" list. The only thing that it is teaching me is to be witty. I get so bored in that reject class that I get witty on the worksheets and get witty with my peers to amuse myself. It's like if you locked me in a madhouse with a strict Nazi loyalist. How absurd!

<br />Tomorow I am going to bring disco music to diving. How absurd!
<br />
<br />I'm absurd!
