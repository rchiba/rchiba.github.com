I'd just like to say, darn it all! First off,let me tell you a story blog. This story is about a pair of sisters who made of a promise. This promise was that they wouldn't give up on life, no matter how hard it was. This promise took place after both sisters had wounded themselves. Years down the road, the smaller sister's heart kept getting broken over and over again as she watched her older sister waste away and forget the promise. Finally, there came a time when the older sister just flat out gave up, shattering the poor little sister's heart and breaking the promise. The little sister thought all that had happened, all the bad things, that had happened to everyone, were her fault. She was very devastated by not only her thoughts, but the broken promise. So late at night the next day she finished by breaking all ties with the promise. She did the one thing she said she wouldn't, and said, this is it. I will hurt no more. And so she brought some of the pain to reality. However, the little sister's mother found out a day after and she had to explain. In doing that, the little sister's confidence of staying clean were forever solifyed. 
<br />So that, blog thing, is the story of the 'X' or the 'Cross' and the 'broken promise between sisters'. Did you enjoy that story? Good, I'm not in the mood to repeat it. 
<br />Anyway, school was fine but I share the same fustration at lunch. All I hear about are gross and atrocious things, and now that Ryo has mentioned High School, I have begun to fret about prom and such stupid things I shouldn't worry over. However, ala, I cannot help it. I feel so big, who would want to date one such as myself? I can bet my reputation is already trashed! I can hear it now, they'll call me freak, or blob, or something relating to what's going on with my sister. I will be ridiculed for things I haven't done or haven't planed on doing. Oh the tragedy. 
<br />Anyway, I also dislike the 'AA' thing that's goin' on. I do not believe in too much optimism, and I believe it takes time away from our studies. I do have my honor code, and I don't believe its necessary for us to listen. It's lame and stupid in my opinion. 
<br />In school today I jammed my finger at the 'BUG' awards, or whatever it was. But I did find one thing out; I suck at basketball. Isn't that great? <enter sarcasm>
<br />Anyway, maybe life will;l get better..............or maybe we'll all die!*laugh* joking.
