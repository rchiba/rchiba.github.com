Ugh... blogger is getting unresponsive and it's frustrating me.<br /><br />Anyways, I became so desparate for communication that I entered my email address in every pop-up solicitation I came across. So far, no one has contacted me. Even spammers can't stand to talk with little old me.<br /><br />Also, I signed up for surveys and get-rich-quick schemes that use your computer to test websites. I've potentially made five cents so far. I'm excited!<br /><br />Anyways, I talked to Josh today. It was facinating to see the world through his eyes. He's a genius, you know? I really think he's just too awesome for me to be with him, but hey, why not bask in his awesome glow? Maybe some of it will rub off on me...
