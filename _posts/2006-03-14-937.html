I gain much insight in the ten minutes I use to brush my teeth. I take this long because I usually watch a bit of television during this time. It's really the only time I'm exposed to the droll of cable television programming. But, to tell you the truth, it's not very droll. The programming itself is engaging, but the previews for certain shows are what I like to ponder. <br /><br />This evening, as I was brushing my teeth with mint toothpaste (which I believe is an aquired taste), I was watching and pondering over the previews for future programming that has yet to air. <br /><br />Why does anyone even say "air" anyways? Nothing travels through the air anymore besides the occasional Channel 18 News or PBS. <br /><br />Back to the point, there was a preview for some "American Idol" spinoff, and some other nonsense reality shows. All of which involve money, all of which involve betrayal, and all of which involve mega profits for the broadcasting corporations behind them. The whole essence of such shows says a lot about our society.<br /><br />In health class, we had a question on some dinky worksheet that read, "What does the ease of procuring tobacco say about a society?" <br /><br />Ordinarily, questions on such worksheets are not this deep. The questions are usually, "Define so-and-so", or "What are steps to accomplish so-and-so goal?". Stuff that's just manual copy-and-paste.<br /><br />But, that one question struck me. I could write a five page essay on what the ease of procuring tobacco says about a society. Just the fact that the question has the word "society" in it makes it worthy of an essay.<br /><br />You're probably wondering what this has to do with me watching television while brushing my teeth with mint toothpaste (which I hated when I was a little kid). Well, in the same way that one health question stuck out of the rest of the questions and made me think, the television previews stuck out of the rest of the programming, and made me think.<br /><br />It made me wonder why we reward the bad and punish the good. Celebrate entertainment and degrade education. We "idol" singers and performers, and ridicule science. We make heroes out of artificial beauty and strength, throw our money at men who throw spherical objects and run faster and better than others. We watch movies that portray the sly con artist as the protagonist. In my opinion, it's simply absurd. Watching TV is a lot like watching lemmings run off of a cliff to their ultimate demise. I see dashed hopes and dreams of children who wish to someday become famous sports or movie stars. I see a society focused on pleasure and not advancement. I see the general stagnation or a nation's state of mind. We'd all like to think that we're all sophisticated, rational, and reasonable. But, in reality, it is quite evident that the majority leans toward the blunt, irrational, and unreasonable. People starve, to death. People are subject to slavery. People die of disease and pollution. These are human beings. Human beings that have individual lives that are just as ethically important as ours. And what are we doing but having a wonderful time watching people sing, dance, and defy the law. <br /><br />Are we entertaining ourselves to help us forget the problems that surround us?<br /><br />Or do we entertain ourselves to help us ignore these problems?<br /><br />Think about it.
