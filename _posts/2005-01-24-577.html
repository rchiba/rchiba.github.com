My diving coach wasn't very happy at the end of practice today. Perhaps it was because all three of us (Samantha, Ryan, and I) on the diving team didn't do well at all. He seemed disappointed. That and the best diver on the team didn't show up today. I feel disappointed in myself. I have alot to write about, but I'll have to do it tomorow because I have school tomorow and I have like a trazillion units of homework.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I sang in the lockeroom today. I think that helps enrich my spontaneousness that I've been trying to work on. Devin would be proud...
