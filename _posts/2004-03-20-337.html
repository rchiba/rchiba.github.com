Nggggh....blog-thing, hey.... The start of spring break was about a day, maybe two days ago. I had to leave school early because it was inevitable. As I told you last time, I WAS getting sick, and now I AM sick. Really sick. But not as sick as I was on Friday. The only reason I actually went was because I absolutely did NOT want to miss my Science test. Now go on, laugh. But I didn't want to take it after spring break and be behind everyone else. And so I lasted till fourth period, went to the nurse, was forced to last till sixth, and then I went home where I slept the whole day and night away with few waking periods. Even now my throat is killing me, but I guess I can be thankful that my head isn't killing me anymore. Oh well, day before my birthday and I'm sick, oi vey. My mom is drunk downstairs, my little sister is on the couch, and I am sitting here typing. I hope everyone has a good time this spring break. Ill try to update some more this week.
