Average Yo reporting. I'm painfully ill. I am glad typing doesn't involve breathing. My chest has immense pressure on it and it is uncomfortable to breath or swallow (liquid or solid). There is occasional gas that comes up my goes up my esophagus and it can't escape. It is excruciating. I am still going to school tomorow though. Breathing is hard.
