I hate it when people try to debate me when they have no fact to back-up their beliefs. I mean, they try to denounce something they fail to understand. Since they can't understand the other side of the story, it is not a debate anymore. It's more like talking to a brick wall. Like, when I debate evolution, most of the people who are against me don't know what evolution is. They probably are thinking of evolution pokemon style, which really angers me. I want to smack them in the face, and give them a book. Grr...

<br />Anyways, I aquired some AOL CD's earlier, which roxxors!

<br />Also, I drew a picture. I will post it later. Good night.
