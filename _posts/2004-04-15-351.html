Sucess tastes like an orange. Sometimes it's sweet, but most of the time sour. Never Both.-Average Yo
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />I have got the dirt on Devin, but I might not use it because I didn't get enough dirt. Anyways, it would wreck our friendship (does that even exist anymore?). Anyways, I did 4.8 pushups at this little fitness test at school today. I am now one of the elite. After I did it, people started claping. I was happy. Well, what can I say? Put your priorities streight and you can do it. Now Devin and Shishir want to come with me to the gym. They say they're "inspired", but you need to be more than inspired to get to where I am now. Anyways, summer is fast approaching and that disturbs me because summer is usually boring. At least I have somthing to work on now that I have a movie. All I need is a cameraperson. A cameraperson who can work with me alot. Well, that's my day. I need more dirt on alot more people.
