Wow, looks like justin's in pain. Hey, thanks justin for taking the time to update! Hey hey hey, go to my opinions page because I put one more oppinion on there! Anyways, I got in trouble with Mrs. Kerr for peeling off a sticker on a locker. Is that vandalization? I don't know. maybe, but I think those stupid decorations are meaningless. Hey, if you dissagree don't take it out on me. Your'e entitled to your opinions and mine mine. Also, I have about 30 minuites untill school, so I have nothing good to say. Anyways, today is a half day. !!!YAY NO SCHOOL LUNCHES YAY!!!
