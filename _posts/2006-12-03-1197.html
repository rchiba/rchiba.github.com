Tests have been on my mind. Chemistry, French, and Math tests. Why do I worry so much?<br /><br />It isn't that they're going to be particularly difficult. I guess it's just the most convenient thing to think of. Maybe I think about these tests so much because I believe that thinking about them will improve my grade. Or perhaps I'm not thinking about them at all, it's just what I'm thinking about right now, and it just seems like I've been thinking about them all day.<br /><br />Or maybe I've been wondering about personal displays of affection, and where they belong.<br /><br />I really fail to hold an opinion on this, it's just that I'm curious as to what other people think. I mean, personally, I've felt as if displaying affection in school might make other people feel bad. Like showing underpriviledged people an item of great value. Who wants to be showy? Of course, there's also the fact that there isn't a need for these things in school. It's school, it's a place for education, not socialization. But, who can resist? We're human. The lunch table culture embraces this.<br /><br />Or maybe I've been cooped up in my room all day long. Sunday lethargy... Not the greatest for reading Moby Dick.
