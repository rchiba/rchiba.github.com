ISTEP testing began today, which is still rediculously easy.
<br />
<br />Logic questions were the name of the game, and obviously, many people will get a good grade on it. Except for the essay portion of the test. I saw people just go to sleep, trying to ignore the essay, the impending doom lingering about their heads, while I was feverishly writing my well composed paragraphs. It really bothered me that some people weren't really trying, because these tests don't require intellect or knowledge. All you need is diligence and a pencil. Plus, Indiana assumes that all of its citizens are not so knowledgable anyways. I mean, why else do they give you all of the geometric formulas when their giving you the "Math" (e.g. arithmatic) portion of the test. All you really have to do is plug in numbers, which is hilariously easy. The most unfortunate thing for this test is that we do not get to keep the pretty, neon colored, "Teen Crisis Center Hotline" pencils. I really need pencils. I only have 4.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I hate it when you're sitting in supervised study and you are just focusing 100% on your homework, and your just fretting about a question, someone next to you, or near you starts talking about some obcene or outrageously off-topic subject. It makes my homework tedious and annoying. I look back at all of the people who are either sleeping, or socializing with other people, it makes me very jealous, but I eventually get over it and go on with my work. It makes study hall THAT much harder to stand.
<br />
<br />I am still entertaining myself with the idea for my English project, a newscast based on our current novel "To Kill A Mockingbird". I have plans for it, even though we haven't discussed it yet. On the subject of entertaining, I am also entertaining myself with the idea of making a website where I categorize each novel I read in a specific format, listing the publisher, plot, author, date of publishing, setting, etc. and getting students to go to it. Eventually, if I had enough readers, I could put ads on the site and make money. My first book to be listed will be "To Kill A Mockingbird". That is, if I even make the site.
<br />
<br />I had the whole day free today, which will probably be the only free day in a few months. I think I have done all the homework I need to do. Also, on the funny side, I have a 103% in my journalism class. Previously, I had a 104.5%. It lowered because I got 100%. How am I going to go about keeping a 103% up if every 100% lowers my grade?!

<br />Anyways, Greg the Diving Man emailed me today. I am still questioning my streching abilities, although I used to take part in balet. Yes, the common stereotyped form of dance. And no, I did NOT wear a pink tu-tu...
<br />
<br />Well, that's it for the day. Today provided me enough time to type a lengthy post, so kudos to my day. Unfortunately, alot of my friends' blogs have ceased to post recently. Devin's, Kevin's, etc. Maybe it's school. Maybe their not true bloggers at heart. GOOD NIGHT.
