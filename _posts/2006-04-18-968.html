I felt calm today. Sort of.<br /><br />During lunch, my English books fell into someone's lunch. Mind you that this food was pasta. And of course, gunk got between each page, discoloring, as well as casting a very unpleasant odor on and in my books. Not to mention that I have to turn these books in back to the teacher in a week or two. I also forgot to mention that the owner of the lunch was someone I loathe immensely. <br /><br />I set the books on top of the lunch table. I sit down, and position my books in the middle of the table. The kid sits down next to me. The kid who irritates me in Health class, the kid who obsessively talks about sports, the kid who drives me nuts on the inside, and the very reason I do not to carry a knife to school. That kid. So he sits down. <br /><br />Somewhere down the table (it streches down the whole room), there is seismic activity, or some people jostling the table. I hear a thud, pay no mention to it. Then, turn around, curious. I find that someone had moved my pile of books directly in front of the sports kid's pasta, and that my books had toppled into his pasta. Of course, he takes them out of his pasta, and keeps eating, nonchalantly. And so I sit and stare at my ruined books. Not particularly excited, or angry, or sad. Emotionless. <br /><br />I nonchalantly take the dirtied books to the bathroom, and clean them as best I can with some cheap, brown paper towels. These towels are neither effective at wiping, or absorbing, so my job becomes difficult. After a few minutes, I figure that I've cleaned as much as I can. And so I return to the table, where life proceeds as if nothing has happened. The bell rings, and I'm left with my orange, smelly books. The sports kid has finished his lunch and walks out of the doors. I stare at him, but my eyes are empty. I felt like a cold shell of a person. I suppose I forgot how to be resentful for a moment.<br /><br />After lunch, sort of an odd sort of anger and resentment that has no energy remained in me. A big lump of it just sat in my gut, silent. No visible emotions, no frenzied messages rushing to and fro throughout my mind. Just emptiness.<br /><br />And for a while, I just walked the hallways only knowing where I was supposed to go, but not why. Knowing the name and number on my ID card, but not my personal identity.<br /><br />I suppose one could say that things went well today. I don't see how getting angry, or especially spiteful about my books being ruined would solve anything. I'll just have to deal with the consequences of fate. There's no point in shaking fists at things you can't see.
