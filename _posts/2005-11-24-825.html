And Thanksgiving comes to an end.<br /><br />And no, I did not eat turkey.<br /><br />What I did today?<br /><br />Well, for one thing, I learned how to navigate and edit, move, rename, and change user settings from the UNIX terminal in my old Linux computer.<br /><br />And, I'm learning how to use Blender, a 3d rendering tool. Alex says its user interface bothered him, but I think if I'm going to choose between rough open source and pretty $700 software, I'm going to choose the rough open source. There are even video tutorials for free!<br /><br />How much better can open source get? <br /><br />Plans for Black Friday: I'm planning to go to RadioShack to get me one of those cheapo $10 usb webcams. Hopefully, they'll still be there by the time I get there. I really hope so, because I remember last year, when I snatched that last $20 from a crate at the back of Best Buy. It made me feel bad that I took the last one, with all the people lined up behind me, but the early bird gets the worm, right?
