I am so overloaded on homework and everything, never having a chance to type. As you can see below, Justin is BACK ONLINE, hoooray!
<br />Anyways, now we have 3 official editors of this site. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I AM going to write the terms of service, someday. I am getting all this information on high school at school. It's really overwhelming. It seems like burnout is inevitable. I applied to 3 honors classes and I was accepted. I think I am doing band too. With CORE 40 and SAT/ACT and AP classes to worry about, I am going to burnout. That is scary. It's like staring at the freight train that is going to kill you eventually. Just staring into the inevitable consequence. It's a scary thought.
<br />
<br />Anyways, there's about 3 inches of snow on the ground now. It's all powdery and doesn't seem to melt easily. People are speculating of a 2 hour delay tomorow, but those weather people are ALWAYS wrong. I can't trust anyone anymore. I might as well ask my pants what the weather is. 
<br />
<br />The social talk/rant/speech for today is foul language slowly, but surely penatrating the american children. Children at my school talk and they use profanity CONSTANTLY. They do this even in front of teachers. Even the 6th graders say b*tch *sshole d*ckhead and all kinds of words that I have no need to hear. I think it is the continuing fad of trying to be/act like a gangster/poor prostitute. Why stoop to a level of sadness and poverty like that, don't ask me. People wear black clothes with silver chains and weird shirts. I really question the minds of the children of my school. Foul language should not be at an extent as it is now. It makes everyone look like demented fools who live on the street. It's an indecent cycle of idioticy and moronicness. This makes me think that everyone around me is dumb, and I am average. Just look at my pen name.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I didn't make it on the A honor roll. I am very disappointed in myself. I feel like I deserve nothing. I deserve no home, no food, no friends. I deserve nothing. Anyways, this was because I got a B+ in Physical Education. We were doing volleyball and I guess I wasn't good enough. Oh well, I better try to act more athletic next time. I personally think sports are obsolete, pointless and redundant. Why throw multicolored balls around and knock eachother down to try to get it in a hoop, past a goal line, or whatnot. I think people are wasting their money on a pointless and primitive past time. I hate sports. I support proper health, but sports just takes it over the line. What's the point of trying to get an orange ball into a hoop? I can understand that It's a game and all, so I guess my complaints are not justified. I just wish that those sports stars wouldn't get paid as much. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I hope tomorow is better than today. Depressing as it is, the Average Yo lives on...
