Today was a 2 hour delay and tomorow is going to be a half day. Could it get any better than this? I'm so overjoyed!<br /><br />Anyways, I updated the links to take care of some crappy sites. I replaced them with better links to better places.<br /><br />Something to note today before going to bed: Ryan thought that a Segway scooter powered itself with its "gyro" mechanism. Note to all of those misinformed people: SEGWAYS HAVE BATTERIES AND MOTORS! RIDE YOUR BIKE!<br /><br />I don't like it when people come up with expensive and redundant inventions. A safety bicycle has a seat, and you can become healthier with it. It is also faster and more manuverable, not to mention it's inexpensiveness. I'll put that on my hate list. Segways and Ipods...<br /><br />I've got to sleep man.
