After spending way too much time on modeling, my SMART Car is almost done. Currently, it is being rendered out on the computer downstairs. The processor is chugging along at around 100%, and the image is still going to take about half an hour. I'm assuming it's because all the meshes that I use in the model are all subsurfed by a factor of three. In other words, each polygonal face in each shape is made twice as complicated each time I "subsurf", or subsurface the shape. Thus, my whole scene contains an extravagantly large number of actual vertices. That coupled with the fact that lots of the materials I use are reflective makes my rendering times very long.<br /><br />I'm very inefficient with such things. My next step should be managing the resources I have, to cut corners where I can.<br /><br />But, enough about my futile blendering.<br /><br />I was flipping through this month's issue of PC World magazine, and found a little blurb that read, "Human vs. Machine".<br /><br />Being drawn in by the title I read the blub. The mini-article of sorts spoke of a website called www.mturk.com where one could make money by doing commissioned work that only a human could do. For example, the website asks you to put in numbers that can be found in blury images. It's a bit like doing a "capcha". They pay a cent for every capcha you do. I've done around 250. If all of them are right, I'll get paid two dollars and fifty cents. I'm not sure if it's worth the time, but then again, I've never earned a cent in my life. <br /><br />Thinking about the week that is about to start, I'm a bit overwhelmed. Last week was just a warm up, a testing run to see if I could survive my new schedule plus Robotics. This coming week is going to push the bar even higher. Having the bar raised usually means going through grueling nights of tearing my hair out while trying to understand a seemingly nonsensical chemistry textbook in the depths of my room. Sometimes it's not even chemistry. At any given moment, I could be frustrated on French, English, writing another pathetic speech, or even math. Chemistry just seems to be the issue most of the time because of the sheer workload of the class. <br /><br />This can be both a good and a bad thing. Because there is so much work, it is easy to bolster a grade with easy points. This contrasts with French class, which has no workload whatsoever. Having low workload usually works against me, as a test grade means the difference between failing and getting an A++.<br /><br />Whatever this week has in store for me, I'll take it and move on.<br /><br />Bring it.
