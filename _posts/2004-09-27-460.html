I feel like dead flesh.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I went with Devinoid and Oliver to a play which was TOTALLY SPECTACULAR! Not really, but it was very good. Today was a monday. I'm sure you're stunned by my genius observation. As with mondays, I got up, went to school, and by the time Math was over, I felt like a shell of my former self. I guess I was kind of overwhelmed by all the homework and all of my extracurricular activities, my body just kind of stopped working. My dead flesh and the textiles attached to it seemed to move, but it was surreally moving without my control. I just floated over to band, where I played terribly because I was unable to practice lately because of my insane schedule. Our teacher didn't dismiss us in time so my next mission was clear. It was to get to French in time. Unfortunately, I dropped my folders, which spilled the contents out on the linoleum floor, which also happened to trip people, which knocked over stands, which in the end I had to clean up. With only about 3 minutes to spare, my adrenaline was pumped up. The race was on. I sped out the door, checking my pockets to see if my wallet and glasses were still there. With that in check, I rushed up the stairs, furiously opened my locker, slammed it, flew down the stairs, and with a few seconds to spare, I made it to French, albeit sweating and panting. What a rush...
<br />
<br />Anyways, tonight I had alot of homework, so this is pretty much my only entertainment, and it should be, because it's my hobby. I learned how to program my cd player in my room, which is a big plus, because I can use it as a sleep timer now. That's very very good. Another thing on this list of things to do is to bring earplugs with me all the time. This is to shut everyone up around me in study hall. Everyone is just a complete annoying biznach, so my plan is to put on my earplugs, forget about all the untamed masses of people who happen to NOT have homework, and just focus soly on my task at hand. It sounds hard, because it is.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am converting my animes for Ryan and I to watch. I think this morning busride anime show is being successful. 
<br />
<br />Also, when I have time, I must schedule a studio appointment with Ryan and Anna for my upcoming AV project. Very interesting... Another hobby of mine. Movie making.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I must remember to get "The Battle of Evermore" by Led Zepplin because Oliver told me to. And you know what happens when Oliver is unsatisfied. He comes at night wielding a giant pancreas plush toy, picks your lock, comes up to you with his pseudo-hobo-imitation voice and starts wacking you with it while you scream in terror as his pseudo-hobo-imitaiton voice starts laughing with audacious insaneness. Yes that's oliver.
<br />
<br />Time to go to sleep. Good night.
