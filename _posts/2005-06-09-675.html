Yowza!<br /><br />I'm reclining on the couch. I'm hurt, injured, and bleeding.<br /><br />Yes, a horrible event has occured! There was a hose behind the lawn tractor I was dragging out of the garage. I noticed it, and I underestimated the friction values of the hose and the concrete. This coupled with the fact that for some strange reason, my lawn tractor has a plate of metal about ankle-high sticking out of the back led to the demise of part of my flesh. <br /><br />I slipped on the hose, my leg sped under the lawn mower, and what unfortunately stopped me was the metal plate. It tore about a centimeter into the flesh just above my ankle and I hobbled back into the house to get some antibacterial foam and a extra-large band-aid. Now I'm a disabled man sprawled on the couch with a laptop and a wireless tranciever.<br /><br />Yes, the ice application is starting to kick in. My worst fear in all of this is if I have to get stiches. I've never gotten them before, and I never want to. I can't stand sharp objects. Yes, beat me to a pulp with aluminum bats, but just don't poke me with a pin. That's my philosophy.<br /><br />Poor cells, they never knew what happened to them.
