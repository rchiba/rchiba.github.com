On the last day of French for this year, today, my teacher asked me a good question.<br /><i><br />"How are you today?"<br />"Better than yesterday, that's for sure."<br />"What's changed since yesterday?"<br />"Yesterday, I was worried. I looked at the things I was stressing over, and decided that it wasn't worth the time. Today, things are going to be better."</i><br /><br />As a pleasant surprise, that last sentence came true. During the next period, I took my fated Algebra II final. On my scrap paper, I wrote:<br /><br /><i>"It's a breeze. No worries."</i><br /><br />The timer was set, and the tests were opened. I started taking the final, and the problems didn't seem so intimidating. Sure, there were quite a few that I had to guess on, but they seemed different, not easier, but just a little softer, brighter, and more appealing. Halfway through the test, I realized that I was smiling. To think, I was enjoying taking a 2-hour long math final. I looked back at my scribbling that I wrote before the test began. I had then obtained a calm, empowered state. The rest of the test really did seem like a breeze. Each question fluttered away, and didn't pester me. I turned pages in the packet of paper decisively and deliberately, when I ordinarily do so frantically, in a crazed frenzy. Guessing on a question didn't bring mental self-degradation. Instead, it was a simple, reasoned out choice. I didn't know, so the only option is to guess. I figured, I either know it or I don't. I can't resist something as clear-cut as that.<br /><br />The chemistry final was just as light and refreshing.<br /><br />Tomorrow should be just as delightful, as I have studied for this final. I find irony in the fact that my language classes, English, French, and Speech, are the classes in which I've tried my hardest in terms of studying. All this typing and nothing to come of it, except my own pleasure.
