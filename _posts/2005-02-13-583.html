Something has been bothering me.<br /><br />I was recently watching "Hoosier Millionaire" on the television. This show is a program that showcases people from Indiana competing for cash. As the host introduced each member of the show for its valentines day special, I noticed something very scary. I noticed that three out of the five contestants looked desperately low class citizens. You know, the kind of people you might see in a dingy alleyway, in a drunken stupor. One guy was actually just learned to read and write. To think that one out of five "Hoosiers" are illiterate and that four out of five "Hoosiers" are poverty stricken bothers me. I sure hope that money isn't going to be used for booze...<br /><br />Anyways, Blogger seems to be having problems so I'm thinking of backing up my writings on a floppy disk, but I'm just too lazy to. I know I'll feel like killing myself when Blogger goes bankrupt and I lose all of my diary, but I don't have the time. This week is going to be the highest stress level of it all. Diving, Diving, Diving, Tests, Diving, QuizBowl, Diving, Tests, Cramming... It'll all end on Sunday. I know I'll make it, but just thinking about my stress just wears me out. That's probably my problem. I think about my hardships and it makes me feel bad. I should probably watch a movie about ethnic purging, a.k.a. Hotel Rawanda, and maybe I would feel better then. <br /><br />Better to be optimistic than an insane and schitzophrenic lunatic, the voices inside of me always say!
