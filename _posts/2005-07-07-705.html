This morning, I woke up with shortwave dreams in my head. I headed over to my computer at 7am and started to study more about shortwave (A.K.A: world band) radio. I realized it was 10am and went downstairs. I found a radio shack ad inside of the newspaper and started flipping through it. Sure enough, I found a shortwave radio. The cool thing was, it was powered by a dynamo, or hand crank. Rushing up the stairs, I found some spare 20 bills in the hidden compartments scattered around my room, and went to radio shack with my mother at around 1pm. <br /><br />I wish I was a black guy. The guy who was my "salesperson" at radio shack was a black guy. He was very nice and he laughed constantly. He was a real "people person." I loved his attitude. It was just so spunky. The white people that work at radio shack are usually socially alienated nerds who don't like to talk, or be corteous to customers. They mutter something about being out of stock, and return to the desk to twiddle their thumbs. They seem like angry little white men, which they are. The black guy was friendly, funny, and lively. He made me want to buy stuff. I wish I had taken a picture of him so I could have hung it on my wall and labled it, "Role Model."<br /><br />Well, about the radio. I'm in love with my new Grundig FR-200 radio. I love listening to BBC. Love it! Oh, and those in London. I hope the situation improves. I love my radio.
