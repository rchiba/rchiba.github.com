Some call it another over-glorified standardized test.<br /><br />Yet, others call it an essential tool to measure future success.<br /><br />I call it the PSAT.<br /><br />Since I'm taking it tomorrow, I should have studied. I did not. Thus, I am ashamed. It's not a matter of not knowing, or knowing things. It's a matter of getting the mind to think in a certain way, to follow certain protocols specified for tests. Earlier this week, I was supposed to, like my peers, simplify my cognitive recognition to five choices, circles. The correct choice is my key to the future, supposedly. Can one not etch a life for one's self without standardized testing? Must life be so controlled by a higher being? Although I understand that testing like this is needed to root out the "undesirables" out of the professional workforce, I still think this kind of standardized testing assumes that all people think in a "standard" way. The people who certify these tests for public schools are assuming that every student is a "standard student".<br /><br />This is obviously not the case, and to make my point, great writers, artists, designers, and philosophers did not take standardized tests to become who they were. Filters are understandable, but now, because I'm at risk of being "filtered out" of the "desirable" group of the elite, the filter seems menacing, like Big Brother sorting the elite from the untouchables.<br /><br />Who am I to say that standardized testing has a negative impact on society? I'm just feeling negative about it because I haven't studied. It's disgusting, how I'm trying to justify my unacceptable behavior. I hate myself.<br /><br />I hate myself.
