It's the kickoff of NaNoWriMo today, and I've written 2400 words so far. You can check the button I added to the bottom.<br /><br />In other news, my life has been beseiged with projects. I'm drawing, writing, thinking, doing tedious homework, and going nuts! Time is my enemy, and as I write this, everything has a deadline, and some things are going to have to be postponed, to my dismay. Things like, my drawing, for example. You can't really call it "my" drawings though, since I just use references. I feel bad when I use references, but I think I learn through repetition and copying the masters. <br /><br />Bah, back to drawing and writing. Things must be sacrificed!
