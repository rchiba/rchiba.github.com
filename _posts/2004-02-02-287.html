Average Yo here,
<br />I have some news that makes me feel scared, but I can't tell anyone because it is confedential right now. I am scared. Anyways, tomorow is the day I go to Harrison. I hope it doesn't get cold tonight or I might not be able to go. Anyways, Shishir said that he was going to West Lafayette High School. He said that he is afraid of druggies that go to Harrison. I don't know what Shishir is talking about. Just because there are druggies at school doestn't mean that he will become one. Also, West Lafayette High School is a tiny high school and have the same intellect as Harrison High. Also, I think a larger school would have more classes and opportunities than a small school. Don't you think?
<br />
<br />Anyways, I just got back from the gym and it is late at night. I think I should sign off soon. I wish I had more time to talk. I am such a loser, my only friend is my blog. Actually, I am not a loser. I've got the 2 very talented editors of this site. Anyways, I have to go sleep. Bye
<br />;)
