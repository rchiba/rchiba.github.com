My goodness...<br /><br />This weekend is going to be horrible. I can't wait until it's over. I just want to go back to school and work like a dog until my time for work is lax. These little weekend breaks just taunt me like a cheese sandwich tied to a string on a stick in front of my face. It's getting on my nerves that everyone else is busy living a social life on the weekends and going to all these "party" things and I'm working diligently on a project that probably won't influence my grade significantly. This whole "weekend fun" sentiment for teenagers is just a slap in the face for me. <br /><br />I mean, someone today asked me what I do for fun. I was caught off guard when this question was asked actually. Not many people ask how I feel, but only rant on about how they feel. So I thought to myself for a bit. An awkward silence fell into place, and my mind was lulled into complacency as I formulated my answer to this very complex question.<br /><br />"Fun? What's that?"<br /><br />I suppose it was a joke, but I think it's a statement that characterizes me well. Nothing really is "fun" anymore. "Fun" was when I played tackle football in my backyard and didn't feel a social obligation to not yell expletives to the opposing team. "Fun" was when I used to be a N64 first person shooter ace. "Fun" was back when could sit down and feel satisfied in doing nothing productive besides eating.<br /><br />Fun is now gone. Satisfaction, efficiency, and productivity have taken over. Cast away, "fun" is now locked somewhere deep inside of my inner psyche. <br /><br />Now, my life doesn't seem justifiably worth living if I don't do something productive constantly. Everything must have a concrete plan, but when things don't go according to plan, the basis of my life crumbles beneath me. In this way, I'm a very inflexible person. Handling change isn't my forte. And in addition, tasks have become more demanding. I feel like now is the time when the demands of school have been kicked a bit higher. It's like trying to run memory-hog Windows XP on a simple Linux box. Unless I upgrade, I'm going to crash, burn, and end up in the landfill with the rest of the dead electronics.<br /><br />But, back to the topic of "fun".<br /><br />You know what I did for "fun" today? I talked to Amazon.com customer service and learned "m", "k", and "r" in morse code for "fun" today.<br /><br />*Note: I'm using "fun" very loosely for the first act.<br /><br />Actually, the morse code thing is actually quite neat. I've been romanticizing about morse code, just like how I have been with Russian scientists, for quite a while, and to finally take a stab at learning it is a fantastic experience. I'm hoping that I can get all the characters memorized at 3wpm by the end of this month. If I hit that goal, then I'm moving up to 5wpm, and maybe even 10wpm someday! <br /><br />Oh, the silly, vintage-tech romanticist I am.<br /><br />Well, one things certain.<br /><br />I would rather learn Morse than binary. That's for sure.
