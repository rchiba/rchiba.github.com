I remember a day in the Indianapolis Airport. Back before terrorism shook the FAA like an infant in a wood shredder. At the time, I believe I was going to travel back to Alabama for a week. Flying by myself, or course. My father doesn't think well of the place, and my sister is too young to remember the place enough to feel attached to it. I, on the other hand, have fond memories of quaint, little Greenville, Alabama. <br /><br />So there I was, sitting on one of those musty terminal seats. The kind of seats that are usually some gaudy shade of blue, orange, or green. Seats that creak when one puts too much weight on them, the kind of seats that have been sat in by thousands of people over many decades. Sitting there, smelling the terminal, it smells like exhaust and plastic. Traffic is slow, captains from a nearby plane walk out and stride to the magazine rack nonchalantly. The man at the counter, in charge of the tickets, smiles. Not sure if it's fake or not, but it doesn't seem to matter to most of the people who catch a glimpse of him, so the smiling continues. It's a lazy summer afternoon, nothing to do.<br /><br />Just a half an hour ago, my father had dropped me off at the airport.<br /><br />And now I hear a call from a fuzzy airport speaker. One can tell that this airport has not been refurbished in many years. The call instructs me, and other passengers to report to the counter. The smiling man looks down at me from the cheap, grey counter. I hand him my ticket, and I start walking into the flying concourse that will take me to my plane. <br /><br />Suddenly, a jerk to the arm. The smiling man asks me if I have an escort. At this point, I'm confused. <br /><br />"What is this escort bussiness?", I am thinking.<br /><br />And the smiling man isn't smiling so much anymore. He says that I can't get on the plane without an escort. Confused, and scared, he leads me back to a seat in the terminal near a window and an old, rusty wheelchair. There's a soggy mop nearby. It bothers me for a moment, as soggy things often do.<br /><br />From my seat, I can see the smiling man on the phone with someone. <br /><br />And a moment turns into a few minutes, then into an hour. Each ticking second leads to social instability. With no parents, I have no back up mechanism, nothing to fall back on. I'm irritable<br /><br />And so a woman comes up behind me and taps me on the shoulder. She's in a striped uniform, neatly combed hair, airport-ly plastic smell. A whiff of something else, which I couldn't tell at the time. I assume she's there to take me to where ever I'm supposed to go, and my assumption is correct. <br /><br />Winding through lax security, I have no clue where we are going. "Madness!", I think to myself. And in some sense, it was all madness. The world was a blur, being dragged by airport personnel to an unknown location.<br /><br />Finally, we reach the corner of the front of the airport, where the ticket counters are. It looks like a corner, but suddenly, I realize that the corner has a door behind it. I go in.<br /><br />And the scene inside facinated me. About six or seven airport employees sitting around a card table eating tuna from the can. The smell. It must have been tuna. She drags me in, and the men and women sitting around the table greet her enthusiastically. The tuna lady introduces me and my situation (of having no escort to take me to Alabama until my father realizes his mistake and drives back to the airport). She sits me down at the table and asks if I want anything. I don't say anything, so she gives me some food court vouchers, five of them. The flimsy paper cards end up being my only compensation for being in this mess.<br /><br />But, the personnel seem to interact with each other as if they were one big family. I sit with them at the card table while they eat and discuss things going on around the airport. There is no window in this secluded room behind a corner crevice. Only the harsh light of a flourescent bulb. The fridge hums a comforting hum. And I sit there for thirty minutes or so, absorbing the atmosphere, flipping through my vouchers. There's a Burger King, Panda Express, and three Subway tickets. One of tuna lady's friends notices that I'm flipping through the vouchers and she asks me if I'm hungry. I'm not, but I say I am to escape the monotony of tuna-eating.<br /><br />I walk out, and I see my father walk in through the front doors. I run up to him and away from the mysterious pack of airport workers. They smile at me and wave. I smile back. And for that split second, not even a moment, I connected with the tuna lady. <br /><br />And to think... I still have no idea who those people were. <br /><br />I didn't even have the chance to thank them for the vouchers.<br /><br />Memories... It's so odd to me how I can remember this so clearly even though it all happened years and years ago.<br /><br />And it's not so odd that I can't remember so clearly my chemistry that I have to take an exam on tomorrow.<br /><br />How unfortunate.<br /><br />(If I don't post again, I'm probably in Utah. Be back in a week)
