Hello, the average yo here. I can't believe that 50 people look at this site a week. I feel entitled, anyways, thank you for coming. Also, feel free to email me, I am not some spam dork.
<br />
<br />Today I discovered and concluded the saddness of culture here in america. We are required to take a class on "Good Consumership". We read consumer reports and all that good stuff. The only bad thing is that I HAVE BEEN SUSCRIBING TO CONSUMER REPORTS SINCE I WAS 5! NO kidding. Anyways, just goes to show you how America is mostly full of wastrels. Oh how I would kill all those wastrels. Muhaha...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I really don't think I should have participated in that stupid class and I should have been able to work on my speech on my pet peeves. Anyways, if you look above, you can see my very own DEATH COUNTER. How happy... I aproximated my death to be sometime in 2050. That's of course if I don't get killed in some accident, suicide, or crime. So, that is my total life to live. Seems short doesn't it.... Anyways you should try something new, for your life isn't always as big as it seems. Most of the human mass is destined to just co-exist in a world of pity.... Ah, and some are talented, like Amanda. Ah, and some are determined, like me. And ah, some are just stupid like everyone at EAST TIPP MIDDLE SCHOOL!
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have all these reports to write and it is FINALS NEXT WEEEK!!! Oh my!. We stupid people are very afraid of the finals. 20% of your grade! I gotta ACE it, or else I die... Oh yea, I got the best score on this chapters test in algebra class. I am very pleased. I hope my science test goes good as well. So, how's your life? Email me!
