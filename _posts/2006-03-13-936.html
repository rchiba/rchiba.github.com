The French test looms over my conscious self.<br /><br />I read somewhere that waiting until the last minutes to study for a test aren't good. I wish this statement was false.<br /><br />I'm trying to take it. Take all the stress, take all the homework, take all the scheduled events, take my extracurricular activities, take my social life, take pressure, take the change in season, take a corrupted hard drive, and make it into something. Something that may just be my life. <br /><br />Right now, I'm too un-sleepified to think about anything to write.<br /><br />Besides my neverending frustration involving chemistry.<br /><br />I just can't wait until I take AP Chemistry next year. <br /><br />Woohoo?
