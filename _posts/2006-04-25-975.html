Lately, I've been crashing in the programming room for lunch. <br /><br />I usually walk around the school for fifteen minutes to collect my thoughts, forget about my hunger, and relax. <br /><br />Wandering through the school, there are so many little things that one notices. From how many paper towels are in the trash bins in the bathrooms, to the quaint frayed strands of carpet where wear and tear through the ages has unraveled the worksmanship of overseas carpetmakers.<br /><br />My friend usually opens the door to the programming room when I arrive and knock on the door. I'm fearful that he may be annoyed by my presence, that I'm somehow mooching his free space away. Most of the time, he plays relaxing Japanese pop music, so I always manage to calm down. There's something comforting about a room full of silent, unnetworked computers.<br /><br />And so my lunch has flown by quickly for the past few days, and I'm loving it. I remember sitting next certain loud people, in a room filled with noise. The clamor of eating, socializing, and the occasional stunt that the next horomonally-unstable idiot decides to pull. The smell of tomato paste and nacho cheese, the smells of things not worth mentioning here. Sticky tables, the even the air being unclean. I've found an escape.<br /><br />It's 1 in the morning, and I'm debating not sleeping. After all, I'll be on a bus for 10+ hours, but I have a French quiz tomorrow as well. <br /><br />Like I said, I'll be leaving for Atlanta tomorrow (technically today), and as such, updating will be scarce, if any. Be back on Sunday.
