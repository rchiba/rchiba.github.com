Ryan and I started to make a sad attempt of a radio show on flashflashrevolutoin.com's chat room. I think the fun is starting to fade. I tried to install some drivers to hook ryan's eyetoy camera to my computer, but it hasn't been working and has just been frustrating me. Tomorow's summer gym.
<br />
<br />I'm really excited because I might get to get a Sony Clie UX or some other PDA device. Yay! Anyways, as I've mentioned before, tomorow's summer gym and my happiness is starting to wear off. 
<br />
<br />Wait, I've just noticed... Ryan left his EyeToy here. Better call him.
