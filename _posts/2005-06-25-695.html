So, I walk into my room. With the push of a button, my room springs to life. The lights reflect off of poorly taped posters that sag from the walls. The walls glow with intense, faded eggshell white. Carefully, I tip-toe to my faded plastic/plywood desk, careful not to disturb the inner sanctum, the holiness of this provincial paradise. I sit in my ripped vynil chair and gaze into my 6 year old HP laptop. I flick it on and the sound of a dysfunctional computer fan greets me. After multiple BSOD's and resets, I arrive at my fantastic desktop, in all of it's Windows ME sleekness. The fading grey, laptop plastic creaks as I put my hands on it to type. I continue to admire my desktop, with it's 800 by 600 pixel resolution awesomeness. After staring into my computer for a few minutes, I turn to my right. I push the crooked "POWER" button on my stereo. The CD inside klinks and starts spinning. I hear a plink and a long scratching sound. In all of it's perpetual greatness, the CD drive struggles to read the disk. Distorted music starts to churn out of the poor, old machine. I relax and lean back in my office chair. Smiling, I find myself astounded by the sheer glory and amazingocity that is my room. <br /><br />That's how most of my evening hours are started. Evenings usually consist of looking up random facts on wikipedia.org, reading about cosplay, or fantasizing about nintendo products. In case of emergency, I break open the glass and check my email. Finally, after arduous hours of toil and effort in following my difficult routine of reading and sneering in my own devilish way, I turn to my blog. I write, but poorly. And, this is why I continue. It is my fate, in this way, I am destined for perpetual and constant writing, in a manner that will never achieve the grandeur of other famous bloggers. <br /><br />I sigh, but know, deep inside that being famous isn't what it's all about. Improving yourself is. My destiny, unfulfilled. So, I continue my journey. Choose your destiny, eh? I say that fate is what governs what happens. Otherwise, the only other way to choose your destiny is to trek to Burger King and buy a large food item with a little wax tidbit of paper that governs the innards of space and time. The innards of space and time that say if you won a free apple pie. So, go and choose your destiny. Win that apple pie.
