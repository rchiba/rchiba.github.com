I'm halfway through the weekend.
<br />
<br />I have gotten my 3 RadioHead Cd's and thus I have copied them to every possible media. MP3's and WMV's on my ipaq, and pc, extra CD's for Ryan, and lots of burning. Ryan spent the night last night, and he reminded me that I had diving practice on Monday. I am very afraid...
<br />
<br />Anyways, today was a very successful AOL CD collecting day. I obtained 40CD's from various vendors. Also, my family bought a fire pit, which is awesome because I get to burn things now. It's oddly satisfying. My primordal instincts urge me to burn on and on. I'm going to a play with Devstar and Oliver tomorow. I'm sure it will be very colorful. Anyways, right now, I am formatting anime for playback on my pocket pc, so Ryan and I can watch them on the bus.
<br />
<br />Tomorow I have to satisfy my obligation to go to the gym, which by the way I hate, but feel guilty if I don't go. I just hate it so much, but if I don't go, I just feel explosive because then I just look at myself as a failure. Either way is a burning death spiral to hell, so I guess I'll go to the gym because that's the right thing to do. I've almost finished "To Kill A Mockingbird". I want to finish it so I can start hypothesizing for my project. 
<br />
<br />On the subject of my firepit, I am in a wood delima. If you know me and have excess wood, please, pretty please email me. Wood is good.
