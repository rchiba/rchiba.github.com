You know when you've been overworked when you start hallucinating and forgetting to update your blog. I've got tests, worksheets, holidays, practices, tournaments, bla, bla, etc., etc.
<br />
<br />It's driving me to a point where I just want to type out everything, but by the time I know it, it's already 9:30PM and you're stuck in a rut and you want to go to sleep. It's like that right now. Alot has gone on that I have to talk about, but there is little time to type it.
<br />
<br />I suppose tomorow will enable me to have a bit of extra time on my hands to do things like... Type.
<br />
<br />It is frantic, and it is a mad dash of sorts, but what's at the end of the tunnel? What's the reward? I have no idea. I just have to keep traversing the tunnel to figure out the reward for all of this work. Maybe there is no real incentive. Maybe I'm playing tricks on myself. Even if I am, I am going to force myself to trudge on through the endless geometry homework that everyone else thinks is easy, but I don't. Trudge on with my french test that I am so nervous about. I will get through Friday, and I will survive. Over and out.
<br />
<br />Now to brush my teeth...
