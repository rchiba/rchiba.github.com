I finish talking to my friends at the east corner of the school. Andrew's locker shuts, we all say our temporary farewells, and part. Alone, I arrive to my own locker. I mumble a few incoherent words, pack my backpack with more books than it can hold, mumble some more, take a few books by hand, and get all my equipment strapped on. With hat on head and Chemistry book in hand, I attack the hallways with the shuffle of my loose feet. My legs barely make it up the stairs, and the linoleum floors gleam back at me, smiling. <br /><br />I don't smile back.<br /><br />Opening the door to the robotics study room, I find myself alone. I sit down, mumble some more absurdity, and unload all my troubles and frustrations on my desk. After a few hard smacks on the desk, I feel a little better, and start to pile my books one on top of the other, making a nice pseudo-symetrical pyramid on the desk. A stack of papers as thick as my hand sit in front of me, waiting to be sorted, written on, and finished. I start.<br /><br />After what seems like three math problems later, Rus walks through the door and offers his greetings. I reply with a quip salutation. He sits down with a quaint whine of the desk on the beige floor. We talk.<br /><br />Talk about things about character, what makes a person, and for a limited time, politics. We settle in the studying atmosphere and I get my math done in reasonable time. Rus stays on his math assignment while I pull my Chemistry out. He says something. I don't catch it and asked him for what he said. He says something about personal ego problems, and characterizes my tendancy to insult myself a primitive coping mechanism. This does not bother me. For quite some time, I've subconsciously understood my reasons behind my idiotic behavior. <br /><br />He mentions that people talk behind my back about how I make other feel bad through insulting myself.<br /><br />It hits me like a moose that just realized that it really doesn't need a hat rack. I am exactly like Rus. And it wrenches my stomach the wrong way. My mind grinds to a halt as I realize my failure to comprehend my selfishness. <br /><br />All this time, just like Rus. Shooting myself in the foot to get people to turn and look. Making people feel bad. And it makes me want to crawl up in a ball and die. <br /><br />All this time, just like Rus. Hating myself to make others like me. Selfish, foolish, idiotic. <br /><br />All this time, just like Rus. Denouncing myself in a desperate attempt to compensate for my own troubles. It disgusts me.<br /><br />All this time, why?<br /><br />The previous thoughts, all come together to form one big, cohesive mesh. <br /><br />So, I suppose the course of action I take now is all dependent on myself. I must stop being such an self-denouncing imbecile. Inside, I know it's a sick, twisted, irrational attempt to make myself feel better through the power of pity. This is bad. According to my sources, I hurt other people.<br /><br />Maybe someday, I won't be a failure at life. Someday, I hope to do less damage than good. <br /><br />If that day comes, this paradox will end and I will feel better.
