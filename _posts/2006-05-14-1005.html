A land without remorse.<br /><br />Could it be? After all, reality is only as real as how we see it, feel it, and hear it. So if I really tried, could I stop feeling sorry for myself, stop wallowing in my self pity, stop the nonsense that inhibits me from getting things done, and stop the banter that annoys others around me? Sadly, I haven't reached a point yet where I can just stop feeling the things I do. Remorse being one of those emotions. It's why I type the things I do here. That's why I'm sitting in front of my computer instead of doing my homework right now.<br /><br />And on the topic of homework, I really should have been studying for one of my many finals, but I haven't. This afternoon, I got back into the swing of modelling things. Modelling the futuristic motorcycle from the anime Akira has been on my to-do list for a while now, about a month. So, I modelled it. It took me a total of four hours. I still haven't ventured into uv mapping and such, mostly because I'm just too lazy to do things a new way. <br /><br />Four hours of work that I should have spent studying have resulted in:<br /><img src="http://img103.imageshack.us/img103/3179/akirabike92jh.png" title="AkiraBike" width="500" height="300" border="0"><br /><br />Perhaps I'll start studying. No use in feeling bad now. Might as well make the best of my limited time.<br /><br />So here I go... Going to my room... To study... To open my books...<br /><br />Ok, it's not happening. I'm still sitting here, and I'm still typing.<br /><br />I give up.
