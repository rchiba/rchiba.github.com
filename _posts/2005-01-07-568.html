I went to the movies with Ryan to go see the "Series of Unfortunate Events." The movie isn't important though. The real importance of this post comes from the viewing of a preview for another movie before this movie began. A preview of the Disney movie, called "Ice Princess." I find this movie hilarious and insulting to figure skaters. In the movie, a nerdy girl (Obviously a poser, a real nerd wouldn't act like that), becomes a champion figure skater that competes in the Olympic Games after practicing for a few months. What's so frustrating isn't that she spent a miniscule ammount of time practicing, but it is that the core of the movie is that the nerd discovered "a secret aerodynamic formula" that enabled her to skate well. Because of this "secret aerodynamic formula" this girl can land can land an impressive trick to win. I find this VERY insulting to figure skaters who work VERY HARD for YEARS to land tricks like these and this <span style="font-style:italic;">sad, sad</span> movie states that a "secret formula" can be the solution to instant gratification. Disney has gone too far. First it was "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" that made things unrealistic, but this "Ice Princess" has crossed the line. I hope this movie crashes and burns. I really do because it's a shame that Disney actually spend money on making this trash film about instant gratification in a "secret aerodynamic formula". Tisk, tisk...
