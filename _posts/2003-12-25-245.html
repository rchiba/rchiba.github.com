Today (Christmas!), many things happened. Most for the unfortuantely bad turn. I woke up today, put on (for the first time) my new Wave Ceptor watch and enjoyed the day. My dad was synchronizing his newly opened pocket PC on the computer when, poof! The computer crashed like a Boing 747. It wouldn't reboot and my dad got angry and sad. We just got the computer a year ago. My dad and I tried to fix it to no avail. Finally, my dad called Dell and got an "Official Nerd" to help him. They determined that the hard drive in the computer died. We originally thought that we would have to buy a whole new computer tower. Finding out that all we had to do was replace the hard drive, we were happy. I hope my dad gets it soon.

<br />Anyways, since the main computer was totally kaput, you may say, "Why is he updating then, and how?" Well, luckily my dad kept an auxillary computer just for this occasion. Of course it is old and slow, not to mention obsolete. Running on an old processor and Windows 98, this computer has long lost its sheen. Anyways, I logged onto blogger and found that this computer didn't have a password cookie for my account. The main computer always automatically logged me on that I forgot my password, and my screename. I came into a panic, rushing to remember what my screename and password was. I went into a guessing frenzy, and eventually got it. I now apreciate how lucky I am to have a computer to type at now. If I lost the auxillary computer I am on now, I would have no way to update this site. I am so happy.

<br />Anyways, I am going to Justin's house tomorow. I need to ask him what time he will pick me up. Hey, justin, if your reading this, EMAIL ME!

<br />Anyways, I hope commercialism hasn't overtaken your Xmas (like alot of people I saw at Wal-Mart) because that isn't what it is all about. It is about <insert sentimental happiness saying here>!

<br />Merry Xmas!!! NEW YEAR IS COMMING!
