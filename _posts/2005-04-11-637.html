I just finished drawing a nice Las Vegas sign in my notebook. I know, I'm so productive.<br /><br />Andrew says he finds comedy in my comments about him being a chick magnet. Well, that shouldn't be so because it's so true. I mean, everything about Andrew makes him a running candidate in most everything, especially the dating scene. He's tall... intelligent... and cleans after himself. Did I mention that he's tall? <br /><br />Anyways, I'm working on my pathetic drawings, trying to improve my less-than-mad drawing skillz. Hopefully, someday I'll be as good as the "Plugged Nickel" guy. Yea, I should put a link to his site since he's my idol now. That and Andrew.
