Hello, it is me, ryo, for another blog session with me. I am da blog miesta. Well, right now, I am strapped up to this microphone that I got at radio shak. It was on clearance and was only for 15 bucks. I am happy with my perchase becuase now I can talk to my friend justin and complete strangers all over the world. I am happy indeed. Right now, also, is my friend justin sittin right next to me. He is a great guy. We went to the sports center and did a bunch of kool stuff. It was awesome. Now it is night and I am getting tired and we might have to sleep soon. I DONT WANNA GO TO SCHOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!! Sorry I get carried away sometimes. Justin is doing very well considering his typing disabilaty. He is writing about his life in general, but lacks some details. I dont know why im typing this right next to him because it is weird. I just downloaded this awesome program called toki voki. It records sound from my mic continuously. It is an awsome program considering that it is completely FREE! Welllll... I think thats all for now. I am happy I type fast. TATA my friends;)
