The gravel slowly crunches below my feet. The cold, grey gravel. It's a cold, but slightly humid day as I venture forward along the predetermined paths that the state park system has set up for me. I am in Turkey Run State Park.<br /><br />I hear a beep. My cell phone conveniently informs me of the absence of service. I trudge along. My ankles are starting to ache and I haven't eaten much. My "lunch", if you can even call it that, is a bag of cheese puffs and a sip of water. I feel as if I have consumed styrofoam. I eventually make it to the ladders.<br /><br />The ladders are short, but there are three of them. To continue along the path, you must climb these ladders. There are no guardrails when you transfer from ladder to ladder along a thin cliff. Visitors are many, and there are about 10 people and a dog on one small cliff. One wrong step will cause all to fall to a perilous death below. I am afraid. I climb the second ladder. I see a spider in front of me. I start shaking. Trying to control myself, I ask the person ahead of me to kill the spider. She kills it. I am relieved.<br /><br />I reach the top and continue. Another few miles to go...<br /><br />So, that was what happened today, Father's Day. My ankles still ache. Tomorrow is driving school. I don't think I'm going to have a good week, but it's nice to pretend, so I suppose I'll do that. I'll pretend that this week will be fantastic. Yes, and hopefully my fantasies will come true. No, not that way you sick, dirty, (insert expletive).
