Hello.<br /><br />Blogger is not publishing with Opera, and can only be published using IE for some reason. Firefox crashes on my laptop, so I have to use IE. And I detest that.<br /><br />My gig of ram should be in a box in front of my door tomorrow. I'm excited for that. I really want to run more than one data-intensive application for once in my life. This gigabyte of RAM will boost my total RAM to 1.5 gigabytes, and that makes me happy, because, hopefully, this will make everything as smooth as glass. I hope after installation things will, as Alex says often, “just work”.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I'm not so fantastic with the technical stuff. Sure, my hands are tiny and can get in small places, but I'm very clumsy and not fit for dealing with physically precise things. <br /><br />I'm not quite sure if this is caused by my heredity, environment, or just chance. But, I shake. I hold a phone to my head, and my arm shakes. I try to hold a pencil still on a piece of paper, but I shake and make zig-zag lines by accident. I try to carefully hold a vial of acid, but my hand shakes, and some of it comes out and spashes onto my hand. I cannot control my shaking. Even when speaking in front of my class, my legs and hands shake, the notecards trembling with my hands, vibrating. If I'm making a speech my voice wavers nervously. It continues to embarrass me, but I can't control it.  I try to continuously move, in one way or another, by making hand gestures so my shaking is not so evident. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />Bah, but what is with me and finding every defective thing about me. <br /><br />This website isn't going on my resume, that's for sure.
