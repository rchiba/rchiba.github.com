Oh, yea. I remembered something that I forgot (oxymoron am I). IT is that people are reading this and going "wow, i want to make a website too" Well, If everybody made a website as good as mine(not to brag or anything) My site and everyones would be useless and I wouldn't get the supersential traffic im getting. Only those who are determined and are willing to learn, can do it.
