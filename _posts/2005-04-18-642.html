When Kara said, "Do you have a 'Xanga'?" (For refrence, a 'Xanga' is a blog hosted by a company called 'Xanga'. I know, original) I immediately knew something bad happened. Blogging has hit the mainstream at my school. With "AOHell" Instant Messaging, it seems "Xangas" have become the weapon of choice for budding bloggers. Once something hits mainstream, it instantly becomes not so awesome as it was originally. A bit like that "nuba nuba" dance. At first, it was a bit funny, but once those jocks that sit behind you in social studies start humming that tune you know that it's not funny at all. It becomes almost offensive, it brings shame. Mainstream is not good. Mainstream is unacceptable. <br /><br />Now, since blogging is unacceptable, you would expect me to shut this site down. Well, I KNOW that this "Xangaing" thing is just a shabby fad. I know many, MANY people who have tried blogging. They would last about a month before they quit of boredom or lazyness. I estimate that 98% of my peers will quit "Xangaing" before this month. I can't wait until this fad ends. Until then, I'll be known as, "Mr. Uncool", so call me that. No... really...<br /><br />I took two tablets of "Tylenol SEVERE Congestion" medication this morning. Needless to say, the side effects were... adverse. Non-drowsy, non-shmousy...<br /><br />Well, we went to this Convocation in the auditorium this morning. This was when my medication was taking full effect. I sat down, barely understanding anything that was going around me. As I sat down, this tough looking kid with really saggy pants sat down in front of me. Dazed and uncontrolable, I yelled, "Hey, I bet I could find a correlation between how low someone's pants are and their IQ!" to my friend Adam. The tough looking kid looks behind and I say hello. Adam whispers, "I bet I could find a correlation between how loud someone is and how long they live." Luckily, I lived.<br /><br />Throughout the day, my mind was inactive and woozy. Not good.<br /><br />Heh Heh... Note to self: No tylenol in the morning.
