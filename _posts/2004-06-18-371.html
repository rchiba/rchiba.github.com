Today is Friday, a day of rejoicing!
<br />A weekend of pure non-summer gym is ahead of me!
<br />
<br />Anyways, since the non-summer gym activities haven't started yet, let's talk about summer gym. There's this kid who is of large build, blonde, and is white. He has a tan though. Anyways, I was in soccer and he is in my group. It was hot, and he saw that I had a water bottle in hand. He asks if he can have some, and I promptly say no, because I brought it for me! He took it away after I said no so guess what I did. I grabbed the water bottle and squeezed it, thus propelling water toward him and semi-drenching him. Now, why would you ask for something, if you're just going to take it. Maybe it gives him the false illusion that he is being polite. And he's not. If he sees something he wants, he gets it to others expenses. But even though his character justifies my acts, I feel guilty. I am brooding over this currently. I constantly have to brood over something...
<br />
<br />Until tomorow!
