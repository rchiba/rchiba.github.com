Today was a distressing day, also being the last day of ISTEPS. Thus, tomorow will be just FULL of homework. Even though today was of lesser homework, I started exagerating all of the little homework I had in my head, and by the time I knew it I was totally overreacting and was about to scream at the next popular football jock dude who happened to run over me in the hallway. Fortunately I controlled my anger. 
<br />
<br />Also, part of my anger stemmed from the fact that my neighboor's (Justin) sister called me the "biggest nerd in the neighboorhood". Even though this fact just might be true, I still think she is very mean. I mean, this 1st grader is insulting highschoolers with no regret or guilt. That is not a good sign. I still feel like everybody's been treating me not so well.
<br />
<br />Yea, talking about my social life, I have hardly any inside school. The usual conversation between me and some n00b is me saying "Hello" and them saying "Wassup, your name is so cool" and then me muttering "whatever" and then them telling me to "speak some chinese" and then me going "I'm not chinese" and then them saying some slang term I don't understand and then me going "Seeya" and them promptly saying the same thing. What a social life. I absolutely hate it that every asian, even indians are "chinese". WTF is going on in their minds. That's like saying all caucasian people are British, even those Italians. I think they should try to keep all of their stereotypes in before ASSUMING that EVERYONE is Chinese.

<br />Anyways, today I had a different lunch, thus I was unaccustomed to everyone's table settings, clans, feuds, territories, etc. I searched around for some of my friends. Then I tried searching for aquaintances. No luck there. I finally decided to sit down with Tiffany (Advanced Geometry person/1st clarinet player) and Zach (Star Wars Fan/ Quiz Bowl Aquaintance) and a bunch of other people who I had contact with. The first half of the time proceeded with me sipping on my Chili and crackers and everyone else talking about StarWars or being a tomboy. I sat there trying to act as part of them, but obviously, my emulation tactics failed. I obviously stood out and looked like a total outcast. Outcasted even in the lower tiers of society. That's when I realized my only course of action would be to leave or stay. This was a very crucial decision. If I left, I risked not finding another table and looking like a total loser/idiot when I came back. If I stayed, I would have to be alienated for the next 30 minutes. Which would I choose? I chose to stay because it would be alot more secure that way. Finally, lunch was over and my escapade of lunch alienation was over. By the time I got to biology, I realized I lost my scientific calculator and I got really sad and angry with myself. That is why I kicked myself in the foot a few times. Not the smartest thing to do, but I don't have a stress ball, so I had to do something. That's why my foot is sore. It's late at night, and I am unable to process my anime into PPC format so Ryan will have to go without anime. I am still angry that my calculator is missing. I am really angry.

<br />In other news, my earplugs are here, so that is good.

<br />Night is here. Time to go.
