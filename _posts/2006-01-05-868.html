I tell myself it's a matter of time.<br /><br />A matter of time before I instantly "become" invulnerable to the palpitations and anxiety associated with public speaking. For quite some time, I've told myself that I'm fearless, that there is nothing in speaking that could in any way damage my "already-in-shambles" reputation. <br /><br />The fact is, I have speech this semester.<br /><br />I see the class as an opportunity, almost like a toy for me to play around with. Toying around with ideas and throwing them to the public is fun, especially when you get the spotlight and people actually decide to listen. For the longest time, I had given up on being more pervasive. All conversations I attempt to follow in a passive manner. I have trouble, hesitation in challenging authority around me. <br /><br />Since sometime in middle school, I found out that most people are unintelligent, and most people won't listen. So, I figured that letting them live in their own little "stupid world" wouldn't be all that bad. I mean, in a fad-following, musically illiterate, bland world of iPod dominance, there isn't much room for individuality. So what's the point of speaking up and telling everyone about how something that doesn't correlate to their beliefs? <br /><br />No one likes to hear what they don't want to hear. If I tell "Joe Schmo iPod Owner" that iPod's suck, then he won't listen. He doesn't want to admit, or even think about the possibility that he bought an over priced shitbox. So, why even speak up? My plan was to just sit on the sidelines, and maybe if I can't beat 'em, then someday I may be able to join 'em, and in the process cash out on one of these fads.<br /><br />But, speech class opens a new window. It's a beautiful thing, freedom. You wouldn't find a class like this in China. <br /><br />One could say that I experienced two extremes today. There's freedom in speech, and confinement in French. In this class, there was a lengthy discussion on digital portable music players, and the teacher was completely oblivious to the inner workings of electronics and such. Because of this fact, there was much discussion and attempts for the students ,who didn't really understand either, to explain to the teacher the inner workings of a portable music player. <br /><br />As the drama intensified, people started prattling out adver-tistics of the iPod like, "It holds 1000 songs!" and "literally smaller than a matchbox!". Hearing such things so blatantly made me cringe. As the discussion got livelier and livelier, and more heated, my cringe turned into a slight twitch for a trigger that wasn't there.<br /><br />And then at the climax of the whole scenario, my teacher silences the class and asks for an accurate explaination, as the concept of electronics is such a foreign concept to her, and the class stares back up at the teacher.<br /><br />I twitch. I want to raise my hand. <br /><br />I attempt to raise my hand, but stop myself. The action was based on my belief that droning on and on about the schematics of basic electronics parts in a portable music player would make me seem pushy. Soon after my attempt, someone who sits besides me and raises his hand. He explains it very simply, and I feel the urge to add details and complicate things. I quell my urges as I convince myself that my peers' simple explainations will fare better with the primitive mind of my pre-computer French teacher.<br /><br />And so French class ends and I try to relax. All the self-induced drama is driving me up the wall. Or across the wall, or below it. Perhaps I'll just jump off the wall into the sidewalk.
