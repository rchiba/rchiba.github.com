EURIKA!!!!
<br />I HAVE FOUND OUT A WAY TO KEEP MY MOTIVATED!!!!
<br />I was just playing runescape when I realized that it was a waste of time and was unproductive. My new idea is... dramatic pause....whenever I want to play runescape, I just go to blogger and type to my hearts content. Isn't a great idea???
<br />I sure think it is!
