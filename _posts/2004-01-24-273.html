Today started out moderate and ended moderate. I went to the mathcounts meeting and found out that my ACT testing date was on the same day that my mathcounts competition was. I have to pay 16$ to change the date. It's like I'm cursed or something. Well, at mathcounts I demonstrated my stupdity. I lost every practice competition thing we had and it made me feel stupid. I guess someone has to be at the end of the line. I just wish it wasn't me. Anyways, I got home and I looked into the mailbox. To my happiness, MSN version 9 came. It is awesome. I can make picture story things. I made this funny black and white movie. If you email me and ask, I will send it to you. I am so proud. It is kind of sad that it took me an hour to create a thirty second movie. Oh well...

<br />Anyways, I am planning to go to Barne's and Noble's. I really need to read and stuff. Playing games just makes you dumber.I also need to study my Vocab for English. Once I get that done, I can get on with my life. I also have to study factoring and everything else. I think I am paniking. All this homework I havent finished is overwhelming me. It is calling to me. If I don't get it done, I will feel like a failure. Better go do it soon...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I hope tomorow goes well. I heard that it is going to snow 2-5 inches tonight. It will probably not, but it might. I hope it doesn't. Driving is harsh in harsh weather. I finished updating my speech and I sent it to Mr. Rice. Well, that's all I have to say.

<br />Good Night
