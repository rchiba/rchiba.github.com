This morning, I am soon to go to math counts. If all goes well, I shalleth join. And if not.... I shall quit.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I got a haircut yesterday. I look very different. Those 8 inches of hair are all gone. Well, on my schedule today, I am to write an opinion. In case I forget, it shall be about the bribery parents use to get kids good grades. I don't mean the parents paying the school... No, I mean the parents giving the kids money. I look down upon these unfortunate peoples.... Anyways, the opinion will be up by tomorow, I hope.
<br />
<br />I have to do a project on Oregon. My dad said he went to oregon. Anyways, that just means more work for me. Also, if Karl doesn't show up, I will be all alone, because my other partner goes to Florida. I guess I can do all the work myself... But that wouldn't be fair, would it....
<br />
<br />Anyways, I put up a shiny new banner on the top of the page, pretty, pretty. Well, that is all I can think of this morning, so for all you valiant readers, thank you, and feel free to email me!
