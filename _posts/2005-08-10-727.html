Some strange cyberkinetic force led me to become a "resident" of a game called "Second Life." It's a bit like the "metaverse" from "Snow Crash", if you know what I mean. If you've never read Snow Crash, then you should. Otherwise, let me explain to you this amazingly laggy social software.<br /><br />Basically, it's a bit like an MMORPG, except without the tedious leveling up and item collecting. It's an online universe in which people can customize their avatars, blah blah blah... <br /><br />But, here's the thing. You pay a flat fee of $10 and can build stuff. If a regular MMORPG was a game, then Second Life is a canvas. A canvas filled with opportunities.<br /><br />Enough about my stupid game. Games are stupid.<br /><br />I finished two comics today. I'm not pleased with the second one. It's heading toward the trash. Hopefully, I can draw some more tommorow. <br /><br />Enough about my stupid drawings. My drawings are pretty stupid.<br /><br />So, like always, let me wish you all a safe night (or day, or whatever). A decent sleep schedule must be established, and so I now, I bade you farewell.<br /><br />Farewell.
