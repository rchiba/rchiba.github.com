And so the story ends for Mr. Smith. Life was good for him, but he never seemed to see it that way.<br /><br />That morning, he pulled out the keys from his pocket. Cold, brass keys that were given to him years  ago when his car was only barely used. These keys had been everywhere and had done everything with him. Always securely tucked between the folds of fabric inside of his pants, they contained Mr. Smith's destiny. He inserted them inside of the appropriate slot, and opened the door to his old, grey car. He unlocked the door to his death. <br /><br />Earlier that month, the government had set up a bill to impose strict regulations and certifications religious groups had to follow. Regulations on what to wear, what to say, and what to pray about. Even things as the composition of “holy water” had to be inspected and tested to ensure for maximum efficiency. No, the government didn't want Mr. Smith or his neighbors using faulty “holy water.” Everything had to be perfect for everyone, but it wasn't.<br /><br />A local religious organization wasn't able to comply to the strict regulatory statues. Thus, government cronies were sent to destroy the religious compound and imprison its members. The head of this group was sent a letter by an insider that they were in grave danger. Something had to be done to ensure that this belief would prevail. <br /><br />Members of the group were sent out with a divine mission. Hollow iron pipes were packed with explosives and rigged to explode when the door of a car was opened. Unfortunately, Mr. Smith would be a casualty today.<br /><br />As Mr. Smith slowly freed his key from the hole and creaked the slightly rusted door open, the two wires attached underneath his car connected. This completed the current for the batteries inside of the pipe, which led to sparks. Sparks led to the ignition of the explosive material inside of the pipe. Ignition led to fragments of pipe traveling in excess of 120kmph to Mr. Smith. <br /><br />Mr. Smith was easily cut into pieces in front of his own house, in front of one of his most prized possessions. The metal tore through his flesh, cutting essential arteries, leading to massive blood loss. The fat, the flesh, the organs, the bone, and back out again. Sprawled out on the sidewalk, Mr. Smith died.<br /><br />Was it divine fate? Religious crossfire? Collateral damage for the government's insecurities? It didn't matter for Mr. Smith. The life drained away from Mr. Smith quickly as his heart pumped his precious oxygen rich blood onto the sidewalk.<br /><br />Later, the automated street cleaning droids made quick work of him. His car was melted for scrap, and his body was incinerated. With one swift motion, Mr. Smith's life was taken away. A signature on a bill is all it takes.<br /><br />And so the story ends for Mr. Smith. Life was good for him, but he never seemed to see it that way.
