Things are getting more and more hectic every day.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm not complaining... but...<br /><br />Ok, fine then. I'm complaining. <br /><br />They say, the first step to getting over your problems is to admit that you have one.<br /><br />But, nonetheless, I still think the workload on my shoulders is getting heavier as each day passes. No doubt many of my peers think so too. I mean, it's getting close to final's week, getting close to the week-long holiday hiatus. It's a matter of time before I'm on a van to Florida. But, before this, I must trudge through finals. The Finals.<br /><br />The Finals have a way of sneaking up on you. I'm anticipating for them, but it's hard to brace for something that only comes up twice a year. It's something that one attempts to push to the back of the mind, if only for comfort, until the Week of Judgement. Which, by the way, would happen to fall on the week before the holiday hiatus I mentioned above.<br /><br />Tests, trials, examinations, whatever you'd like to call these things, they're necessary. And I'm sure many of us (using "us" to refer to the students of the post-industrial world) would like to do away with these pieces of paper (or computer screen, if you go to some artsy-fartsy rich school) and just go home to the comfort of our rooms (or second home in the Netherlands if you're some artsy-fartsy rich snob). But, wishes will not do away with these monsters. It's a matter of time before I'm convulsing on the floor, trying to figure out how astrology was used in medieval times.<br /><br />It's just a matter of time...
