I try to get to sleep on time, I really do.<br /><br />But, you know what? Homework, projects, the whole bit. They are greatly taking up my time. I find it frustrating to not be able to go to sleep because I'm obsessively trying to fake my way through a bibliography for some idiotic english project. I absolutely detest having to sleuth around to find the date for some obscure web page so I can put it on my "works cited" or "bibliography" page. <br /><br />The whole process of compiling the reference data is kind of like searching for lost gold, except when you finally get to the gold, you realize it's just a worthless rock.<br /><br />So tomorrow I plan to go to some Robotics Team Kickoff-type event with lots of other people attending. I don't expect to have a pleasurable experience, especially because I really don't like some of the people on our, and other robotics teams. It's a matter of personal conflicts. It's just that sometimes, the conversations my teammates have are so off putting. The intelligence level of some of these conversations is very low. <br /><br />However, there are a few people that are capable of a nice, refined conversation with a little bit of wit, just like I like it. Unfortunately, these people are usually older than me, and thus less "accessible" to me.<br /><br />In other news, I tried doing my speech today in front of the mirror in my bathroom, albiet in the nude. Oddly enough, I seemed to know my speech by heart, or most of it at least. I suppose it's a matter of reading the darned thing over and over until it seems like a conversation. <br /><br />But, the problem I have with blurting out memorized garbage is that I often sound very "fake". Like a robot with a wildly oscillating pitch of voice and over-exaggerated facial expressions. I don't know, I try to emphasize myself too much to cover up the fact that I'm not actually "talking" to you persay, but just spitting out memorized garbage. I've had this problem ever since I participated in my middle school speech team, in the "radio" event. Because this event involves replicating the antics of a radio show host, I came to sound like a radio host whenever I try to speak "professionally". <br /><br />I have to face it eventually. I'm doomed to sound like a bothersome radio broadcaster for the rest of my life.<br /><br />I might as well make the best of it.
