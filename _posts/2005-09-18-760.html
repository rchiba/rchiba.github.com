I feel very "American" today.<br /><br />I drove a large vehicle to a large store, to buy a large Chinese-manufactured bike, went to my friend's house, and shot a large gun, at a large box. And don't even ask me about the large problem with the large man who was drinking a large carbonated beverage while standing in quite a large checkout line at the store. What a large stench!<br /><br />Since the events of today did nothing but make me feel patriotic, I'm going to rant on and on about one of my pet peeves. I don't like that word. Pet peeve sounds like the name of some hedonistic uncle that you have that lives in a commie outpost in the woods. <br /><br />My pet peeve is when people try to hard to be individual. This could mean wearing "odd" clothing, buying pointless stickers, badges, pins, etc. that can be used to customize clothing and accessories, coloring hair in bright colors, worshiping Satan, listening to "emo" music, and playing guitar. If your individuality is so important, why don't you just dye your skin blue, duct tape bricks to your arms, and come to school quoting Monty Python? Indiviudality is a terrible excuse of trying to justify your existance. Being "different" doesn't make you a better person, or enhance your skills. Being "differnt" doesn't mean that you're sophisticated than "everyone else". Being "different" is just a fact. Being stastically unlike your peers, it's nothing to be proud about. Strutting around, wearing unconventional clothing, expressing your obviously short-sighted opinions with witty buttons and pins, is individuality. It is also completely irrational and a waste of energy.<br /><br />In the future, perhaps we will all be the same, and you know what's so great about that? All the concern, effort, energy, and time being put into expressing your individuality will be put into learning, discovering, building, and constructing. Think about how many more things would get done. The post-industrialized world, as a whole, will benefit academically, socially, and economically. With all of that money spent on "individual" clothing being carefully saved and monitored by federal governments, nations everywhere could eliminate national debt. When Miss America talks about wanting to stop world hunger, she's lying. The same goes for anyone in a post-industrial country. If all these people were actually against world hunger, they would stop spending cash on unneeded "individuality enhancing" items.   <br /><br />I hope, someday, this trend will be reversed, and this competition of freaks becomes a competition of skill. And, when this sometime comes, I will be like everyone else.
