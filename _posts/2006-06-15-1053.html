It's amazing that people actually read this. I'm still stunned and excited every time I get comments, and I'd just like everyone to know (Oh no, I'm breaking the fourth wall) that I do read the comments, sometimes two or three times, and that I appreciate that people take the time to send me tidbits of text. Getting feedback feels good.<br /><br />I was flipping through this weeks Time magazine, and found a rounded, black box with the number "16" printed inside. Being attracted by the white text inside of the black box, I read the little blurb. The little block of text was actually a call-out for sixteen-year-olds to go to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/question/sixteen.html" title="time.com/sixteen" target="_blank">time.com/sixteen</a> and write a 300 word essay <i>"about your life and what's on your mind."</i><br /><br />Of course, being the slightly elitist sixteen-year-old I am, I went to the website and read the subject ideas. Possible topics included religion, relationships with parents, the role of technology, the race to college, etc. <i>"Who are your heroes"</i> was a prompt, of all things.<br /><br />But, the question, <i>"What do you think is the biggest challenge facing people your age - drugs, drinking, gambling, interracial relationships, sex?"</i> was  most intriguing to me. And so, I asked myself this question. Living in a very safe community, a very positive environment, it's hard to think of a big challenge. School isn't a challenge as much as it is a hassle. But, reading this question, and reading the suggested answers to this, "drugs, drinking, gambling, interracial relationships, sex" I feel like somehow I'm being left out of things. I mean, the fact that they wrote these in as suggested answers indicates that many sixteen-year-olds must be engaging in these "challenges". But, what bothers me the most is that they classify these things as "challenges". Is sex a "challenge", or a mere act? If you've got the right stuff, so to speak, it isn't that much of a "challenge" to engage in sexual intercourse. The sole purpose of ourselves, looking at humanity through a very simplified lens, is to reproduce. Before social norms began to promote later-age marriages, reproduction at this age was common. So, is it a challenge to conform? Of course it's a challenge to conform, we're fighting our biological clocks to mate! <br /><br />And let us consider drugs and drinking, are they a valid challenge? I've encountered quite a few people at school who often boast of their adventures with alcohol and drugs. They don't seem to be the type of student to every try anything challenging, so I don't see drinking or drugs very challenging. Or, maybe the text suggests that it is challenging to avoid alcohol and drugs. Again, it is very easy for me to say that it is not a challenge to avoid such things, but that all depends on the "crowd" that one "hangs" with. And, my crowd doesn't happen to encourage these things, so my experiences with avoidance are limited.<br /><br />Gambling? What's so challenging about that? I figure that it's just a matter of choice. Is gambling really that bad? I think that it's just like sinking expendable income into anything else. Investing money in a high-risk stock isn't considered a sin, but it follows the definition of gambling, which is: <br /><br /><i> "wagering money or something of material value on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional money or material goods"</i><br /><br />So, is gambling a challenge? If you don't have any money it sure is. But, avoiding it? It's your right to use your money as you wish. <b>The only reason it is challenging is because society compels us to avoid it for reasons that may or may not be justified.</b><br /><br />I can't really say much about interracial relationships, as I've never really been in a relationship as they refer to it in the text. Although, if I ever was to be involved in such a thing, it would most likely be interracial. <br /><br />Interracial relationships. Take out the adjective and it's even more challenging, for me at least.<br /><br />
