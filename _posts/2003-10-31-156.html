Great, all is going well in my kindom of TheAverageYo'sville.
<br />Population:3
<br />anyways, i dont know much to write about besides my cold/alergies have gotten worse. I hope I don't die. Today is halloween, a very controversial holiday to take part in, but I'm going to anyways. Yes, oddly enough, I am going to be a cow. the bus is about 10 minutes away from getting here so I think I'll stop soon, Plus, I don't have anything to talk about, besides my runny nose, pardon this run-on sentence, I am not that good in grammar.
