Hey blog-thing. Nothing much to report from today, but from Friday I have a mouthful. To start off, I wasn't in class because I had to go to court. And what sucks most is that I didn't even have to be there! My mother's lawyer just sucks. Anyways, to make matters more stressful, it was on the fourth floor. Now why would that be stressful? I'll tell you-I don't like heights. Especially not the court house heights. I can feel the floor falling down, causing me to plummet to my doom. Doom I say! doom! 
<br />Anyways, we entered the judge's private quarters. I'll spare you the detail because it was stupid. Our lawyer sucked ice. He didn't defend my mother at all and we couldn't stick up for ourselves. That sucked sooo much! Anyways, the guardian adlitum(Sp?) is stupid, I haven't even met her. Kris ping is stupid, I don't like her at all either. Don is stupid, I hate him with all my heart. He says he has a terminal disease and will die in ten years, three years he's already used up. Anyways, the judge ruled that my visits with don stop and that my mother is awarded full custody of me. yay. and Angela and I are, in a way, ordered to see each other. 
<br />By the way, Kris ping gave me dirty looks and I gave her even dirtier ones. Ha, ha, ha, stupid witch. 
<br />Anyway, that made my day so i ate more good food than I should have, partied a bit, and had...dare I say it... Fun?
<br />Anyways, I still have lots of crap to deal with. Joy to the world there...not. And lots of it deals with Angela and I being used as tools during Don and Mom's divorce. There is lots of pain there, of which I will NOT go into just yet. 
<br />Yeah, and happy Valentine's day Ryo, Justin, and everyone who cares that I exist and yeah, everyone who doesn't care that I exist or know me. Why? Because I'm not in a vindictive mood.
<br />By the way, can anyone sense the sarcasticness of this post? I think its because my family annoys me. Especially, and I'm sorry to say it, My mother and my grandma.
<br />Anyways, here's something interesting. I've been diagnosed with several mental disorders. Go me. Here's what they are;
<br />1) adjustment disorder
<br />2) anxiety
<br />3) depression 
<br />4) symptoms suffered by depression are occasional sleep disturbance, low energy, and mood disturbances of anger, fear, grief, hopelessness, worry, and cries easily when this happens. These moods are usually before and after sessions with my biological father. They also concern my sister, Angela. (duh!)
<br />
<br />That was in my counselor's report. When I took a test online I suffered from more than that. Here these symptoms/conditions are;
<br />Schizotypal: High
<br />Borderline: Very High
<br />Avoidant: High
<br />Dependent: High
<br /> Here is what these things mean (I did not type these up)
<br />Schizotypal
<br />Many believe that schizotypal personality disorder represents mild schizophrenia. The disorder is characterized by odd forms of thinking and perceiving, and individuals with this disorder often seek isolation from others. They sometimes believe to have extra sensory ability or that unrelated events relate to them in some important way. They generally engage in eccentric behavior and have difficulty concentrating for long periods of time. Their speech is often over elaborate and difficult to follow.
<br />Borderline
<br />Borderline personality disorder is characterized by mood instability and poor self-image. People with this disorder are prone to constant mood swings and bouts of anger. Often, they will take their anger out on themselves, causing themselves injury. Suicidal threats and actions are not uncommon. They think in very black and white terms and often form intense, conflict-ridden relationships. They are quick to anger when their expectations are not met. 
<br />Avoidant
<br />Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by extreme social anxiety. People with this disorder often feel inadequate, avoid social situations, and seek out jobs with little contact with others. They are fearful of being rejected and worry about embarrassing themselves in front of others. They exaggerate the potential difficulties of new situations to rationalize avoiding them. Often, they will create fantasy worlds to substitute for the real one. Unlike schizoid personality disorder, avoidant people yearn for social relations yet feel they are unable to obtain them. They are frequently depressed and have low self-confidence.
<br />Dependent
<br />Dependent personality disorder is characterized by a need to be taken care of. People with this disorder tend to cling to people and fear losing them. They may become suicidal when a break-up is imminent. They tend to let others make important decisions for them and often jump from relationship to relationship. They often remain in abusive relationships. They are overly sensitive to disapproval. They often feel helpless and depressed.
