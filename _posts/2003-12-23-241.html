Hello, average yo here again,
<br />Today was boring, but I got to lie to my sister, which was very fullfilling. Well, since she opened her christmas present early (karaoke player), I packed them up and stashed them in my closet. I told her that the "opening presents too early fairy" came and took it away because she was naughty and because she opened it too early. Of course, she knew that I stashed it somewhere, but it was worth a try. Anyways, I am getting more and more in touch with my friend kiran. Not much to say there because we chat every day now. Well, theres this Korean kid (I'm Japanese) that goes to my old school. Guess what his name is? It is Roy. (My name is Ryo). I hope that kid doesn't replace me. 
<br />
<br />Guess what? I get to go to Justin's house. I am so happy. We are going to have a totally tubular and radical time at his house. I am planning to give him a gift. Nothing special, just a.... never mind that.
<br />
<br />Anyways, there isn't much to talk about  besides that the Mathcounts questionaire contest is tied up. 15 to 15 to 15. Very close. Almost christmas, but what is christmas anyways? It is mostly fabricated my capitalists and salesmen who want cash from families. Spoiling children everywhere. Sad holiday, but who am I to complain? It is supposed to be about Jesus and stuff, but this santa/rudolph/elves is totally fabricated my stores. It's like a hybrid between advertiesment and holy night.
<br />Oh yea, today I went to staples and my mom and I got this chair that I can sit in while at the computer. I don't have to sit in this Target-Brand white chair that is unconfortable and weird shaped. 
<br />
<br />Well, that's all for now. Merry Christmas!
