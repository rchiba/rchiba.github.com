School is approaching, and fast. But, are we all actually going to use all of the information taught at school in daily life? Unless there's a criminal takes you hostage and demands include an explanation of allegory in Animal Farm, there isn't really a need for such vocabulary. Who analyzes these novels so intently anyways? It might sound "uncultured," but I believe that novels are only as good as they are enjoyable. Picking apart a novel bit by bit, only to find an abstract idea isn't my way of spending an enjoyable afternoon. Yes, these stories have a message, but so does every Joe Schmo. What makes anyone think that the message of this story will be more important than anyone else's? So what if there's a tiny tidbit of a sentence lurking in the depths of chapter 3 that foreshadows important events further. It doesn't matter if I read the whole book does it? Well, English class is going to follow me around for quite a bit, but I'm still unappreciative of such a nitpicky subject. When I think of English class, I think of finding a needle in the haystack, and you find out later that you have a sewing machine. Numerology is like that too, except more irrational. Blech, numerology.
