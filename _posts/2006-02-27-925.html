A lost opportunity, a span of wasted time, existence that was not meant to be.<br /><br />These most accurately summarize this afternoon. I don't think I got anything worthwhile accomplished. It shames me to be such an unproductive individual on such opportunistic days like this. I'm given six more hours to do whatever I want, and I go and spend it lurking a forum that I know I'll never gather enough courage to join. What a horrible way to spend a free afternoon.<br /><br />But, then again, it's not like it could have been any better than that. Going out of my room was out of the question today, being a Monday. The studying that I so desperately need to do never got done due to my intense loathing of such things. <br /><br />I better stop writing before I end up writing another godforsaken "Oh, woe is me" post (OWIMP).<br /><br />Tonight, I hope to recover some HP from the sleep debt incurred from the past few weeks of sleep deficiency. With the combined sleep resources of Health class, lunch, and my bedroom, I should be able to be back to optimum level by the end of this week. Upon which I will not sleep due to the fact that I'll be going to a Robotics competition far away.
