Helllo, its me. Doing another blog session while simultaneously talking to my friend Justin on MSN messenger.
<br />I was going to update yesterday, but I was too tired. Having gotten back from the airshow and all. After justins party. I got to go to my other friends house, Joe. We spent the night and the next day, we went to the airshow. It was very cool, but not that exciting. We got to see many things. Such as a rocket powered car and a jet engined bi-plane. It rained on us though. And to make it worse, they canceled the thunderbirds air show. I got really wet and so did joe and his family. Luckily we made it to Wendys, post haste. We had lunch and got home. Then, I finally had to go home. I have realised that I will only have a limited amount of these outings of fun, so I hope I can savor the moment next time. And unfortunately, I have to go to school in 16 days. I am so sad:(. Anyways, I am going to get my school supplies today. Uhhhh... I think that is all I have to say. I hope I can still update my blog durring school. If not I will do it every 2 days or weekly. I am afraid of 8th grade. I hope the homework doesnt pile up and get higher and higher. Just like in tetris, once your stack gets to high, its game over for you.
