Summer gym is tedious...
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I went bowling today. The bowling alley is called "star lanes" and it's in a ghettoey part of town. All around, as our school bus drove by, were abandoned buildings and torn down bussinesses. It was very apalling. We went into star lanes and I did very poorly. This deteriorated my mood for the rest of the day. On top of that, I had to go to the gym. I felt like burining the gym down before I went, but while you do all the exercises, all that rage just somehow floats away, and it's gone. You don't know where it went. It's miraculous.
<br />
<br />Anyways, tomorow brings more surprises.
<br />Oh yea, I found out that "America's Army" is a fun game, if you have broadband. It's a game made by the US Army to promote recruitment. Even though I can't join the army (I'm not a citizen) I find the game fun. Too bad I can't play it since the verification servers are down. That stinks. <end transmission>
