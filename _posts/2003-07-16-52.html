Helllo,
<br />This is ryo.
<br />This is evening in Indiana and I am updating my blog. I am talking to my friend Justin.
<br />Oh yea, I have bad news for those school kids out there. It seems as though those devilish school shoping lists are out, which means bad news for kids around the nation. Back to school again! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
