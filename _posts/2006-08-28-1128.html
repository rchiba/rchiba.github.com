I'm amazed at how much time I spend in my room now. <br/><br/>I remember when I debated selling everything in my room because I never went into it, except to sleep. Now I get home, drag by backpack to my room, close the door, and do homework and non-homework until about 8:30pm when I come out to eat food and take a shower. After the shower, I'm back in my room. The power of my room is that it's located on the second floor, which my family rarely ventures up to. Thus, no distractions. There's silence when I want there to be silence, loud music when I want there to be loud music. I control my room.<br/><br/>I get really confused about what people say sometimes. I was talking to Andrew about the events surrounding the football game and what he said confused me. But, I guess he transcends normal action. Goes beyond what I can even imagine. Don't get him occasionally, but he can talk to me with his eyes. A valuable tool in times of dire need.<br/><br/>Red dots all over my hand. Presumably from a covert insect that has been harassing me. There must be one in my room, but I've never seen any. It bothers me. Because when I start thinking about it, I start to think of spiders in my bed, and when I start to think of spiders in my bed, I don't want to get near my bed anymore. <br/><br/>Tomorrow, I get to go to the movies with Ryan and Tiffany. It's something I'm looking forward to. <i>Greatly.</i><br/><br/>It'll offset the negative feelings going through my head after I take my French test first thing in the morning.<br/><br/>I never study enough for those things. They are very difficult tests for me.<br/><br/>Well, I'm off to venture out of my room to eat food. To escape this dungeon of homework and writing and studying and more homework.
