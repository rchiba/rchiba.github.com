There's nothing like a robotics meeting to make you feel like an inferior, deficient, and otherwise substandard clod. <br /><br />So many things everyone can do. It's a room full of talented people, after all, and the fact of the matter is that some people are going to be more talented, sometimes <b>much</b> more talented than others. And, often times, I'm sure it's not talent. Most of the time, I'm sure it's not talent because, sadly, I am envious. Saying that someone else has talent says that the someone has something that you were simply not born with. Something that can never be gained or taken or revoked. A "god-given", so to speak, specialness that is priceless. But, if I rationalize (and often irrationalize) the situation and dismiss talent as hard work, I have an opportunity to advance myself, if only for the sole purpose of relieving my envy.<br /><br />The worst part about it all is that I <b>know</b> on the inside that other people do have things that no matter how much I wish for, I'll never have. I have friends that are charming, so charming in fact, that I often times try to understand how and where the charm comes from. I have friends that are exceedingly fast at math, something that I'll never be able to do as well as them. I have plenty of friends that can interact with people better than I can. Things that I will <i>never</i> aquire. As sad and overly emotional as it sounds, I cannot do anything but agree wholeheartedly to the these statements, a fact that I'll just have to deal with my whole life. <b>And, I'm fine with that</b>. Or at least, that's what I tell myself to keep me from feeling worse than I already do.<br /><br />Envy, it'll kill me in the end.<br /><br />Speaking of killing things, more chiefly of which, dying in general, I have a number of people that I engage in daily rituals with. Such rituals include a certain tap on the back, a hello, or the sharing of a water fountain for a split second between classes. These acts happen at around the same time, at around the same place, with the same people, every day. I say hello to certain people every single day, between specific classes. And it's comforting to have a routine even between classes, but then again, I have begun to depend on these rituals.<br /><br />After all, if someone died, and that someone was someone that I said hello to in the hallways every day, or if I shared a drink of water with that someone every day, a piece of me would die. And I experience it when these people from absent from school on a particular day. And on that day a piece of me dies. But, luckily, it's all temporary. Death isn't temporary. Part of me would die forever if someone I was connected to died. This statement makes me care about the lives of others more.<br /><br />Not that I didn't care about other people's lives before the statement...<br /><br />But, something like that would <b>really</b> impact me for a long time. I want all of myself to live, and so using the transitive property we have all come to know and love, I want other people to live as well. And it makes me realize how much I depend on other people, and how much I enjoy being in company. <br /><br />I guess I enjoy company more than I would like to admit.<br /><br /><br /><br />
