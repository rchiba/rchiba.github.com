I'm sick of all of the genre of noise that popular culture calls "rap".<br /><br />I think Rap is just another dirty streak that human kind has to deal with it. The fact that most Rap supporters are African American just makes it worse. Ethnic diversity is needed in music genres. I don't see how African Americans can be proud of dancing to, reviewing, complementing, or otherwise supporting rap. The disgusting, pornographic nature of rap makes me cringe in disgust. The constant focus for existance for the people in these putred songs always seems to be related to sexual intercourse, drugs, partying, or... well, sexual intercourse.<br /><br />The thing is, the bus I ride to and from school plays rap. This in itself is not really a problem. The fact that little children ride this bus is what is a problem. <br /><br />With lines such as, "I want your dress to come down", "shake your body like a belly dancer" and "Don't you wish that your girlfriend was as fun as me" is sure to conjure up disturbing images of poverty-stricken, drug-addicted, alcoholic, violent African Americans taking part in public sexual intercourse. I'm not saying that all African Americans are like this. Although, the music the majority of the African American population supports reflects this stereotypical image. <br /><br />Noise pornography is the "in" thing these days, I suppose. With catchy beats to ensnare you in its irrational lust. It's techno beats to the constant whine of heavy breathing and disgusting lyrics. I think this genre of "music" is so distasteful, it should be erased from society forever. Erased from the past, present, and future. Save the children from the rap that infests our radio stations, webcasts, and public transportation vehicles. <br /><br />Call me conservative, but I believe that rap is worthless noise.
