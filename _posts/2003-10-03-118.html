Ok, I am having a great day, with all this negative stimulus, I feel absolutely astounded by these peoples emotions.
<br />It's a great way to study psychology actually. Very hands on and you really feel it. Anyways, turbulent times have occurred. Not only now, but like the most of my life, everyday. You know all these hormone pumped teenagers all swarming around me just to cut me in to cubes of flesh. Yea yea yea... you get the deal. These people say they have been trashed. It is no such thing. No such thing. It is all just my life, perspective, you have yours, and I have mine. My life blog cannot be edited, for what I type is what I think, and you can’t change intellectuality in humans. Especially not me. Hey, if you think you were being abused in my blog, why don't you send me an e-mail. With all the hate garbage evil snotty nosed stuff you can think of. Call me bad names, insult me beyond the universe, and pretend to kill me as you write this e-mail. This will get all that hate from inside you and you will finally start living productively in your little human lives. Go on with your lives, don’t pay attention to me. I am just the lowly Asian nerd in the corner doing algebra. Why pay attention to me? I don’t know. This is just words, a perspective of my life. If I changed it, it wouldn’t be my life would it? All these people complaining and complaining. You know why they suffer? I know. It is because people go onto this site and who knows what goes on. In my puny little lifespan of approximately 26,000 days (if I don’t get killed in some other “accident”) I want to record it. Every second, day, and night, my life vanishes into thin air. POOF… there it goes. SO, you know what, I think that I should record it in peace, no matter who I say I think I hate or like or whatnot. These are my feelings, I really value my feelings, because that is what makes me human. I want to keep these feelings, good or bad, in a digital media for all to see. If that is a problem for you, don’t read the site! Gosh. Blame me for everything. Why can’t I even keep my feelings? You strip me to the bare essential now. Just a co-existence is all I want. Is that all I can ask for? I just want to preserve feelings for everyday. If I don’t do that, my life vanishes into the abyss. Then I die. All those things die with me. They go poof. And all those people will be dead to. So why can’t I just preserve my feelings. I might dramatacize at times, but you have to say, sometimes life is dull. SO dull that you have to dramatacize to keep it interesting. Life is like a potion and anger is part of that. I am fine if you are angry with me. I understand. Sometimes, during my anger periods, I treat everyone like trash. So be angry. Cherish those feelings, or else your life too will dissipate into the air. Why do I live in such a time where people and people can’t interact without some conflicts? That is because conflicts are essential in life. Hate me, please, it’s just another emotion. If I say something bad about you, that is just my perspective. Mine only, yours is different. Don’t take it personally. All books have to have a villain. I have to have villains in my life also. I am sorry if my perspective doesn’t agree with yours. It is the way of the human brain. I don’t even know if anything exists. I just might be floating around in “lala land” with these imaginary people everywhere. Just like the Matrix. What if you were just a figment of my imagination? I could be one too.  Overall, I just want to store MY life in MY prespective, in MY words! Consider all the variables before landing to conclusions. Consider all the perspectives. Consider the complexity. Please.
