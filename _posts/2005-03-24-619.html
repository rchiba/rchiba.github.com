My Dance Dance Revolution equipment has come. I've danced my legs to oblivion, and I've enjoyed every bit of it. I can't wait untill tomorrow.<br /><br />Anyways, I did a bit of tomorrow's math assignment (That I got from an inside source) to assuage the homework given to me over spring break. <br /><br />I'm going to see what everyone's reaction is tomorrow when I wear a green fluffy t-shirt and sweatpants. I can't wait to see everyone cringe in horror! Oh, for the sake of maniupulation. w00t.<br /><br />I'm going to sleep. Nothing much has happened today, except that Andrew and Zach tried to convert me to Christianity, again... This is quite.... uhh... interesting. I wonder of they'll ever stop.
