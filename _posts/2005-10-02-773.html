I enter the school. It's dark, and I can see why. After all, it's already six in the evening. The school sure does seem different without light and mindless teenage banter. The peaceful linoleum, the puke yellow walls, the stupid inspirational posters, some candy wrappers on the floor, all familiar things, but the tone, the atmosphere in this once chaotic place is now quiet and dull. The mournful, recycled air filters through my nostrils as I sneak past maintainance workers. I can hear people talking, far away, like a dream. My shoe squeaks, and I become alert. Glancing to my left and right, I scurry up the stairs. The whole building seems dreary, as the setting evening sun makes its way into the school through the glass. It's just another perfect Sunday, isn't it?<br /><br />Why am I at school? Good question. The Robotics Team calls, and I come, seeking a leader to follow, seeking a job to perform, seeking purpose and fulfillment. I start walking toward D207, but what's that?<br /><br />The lights in D205 are on, and there is talking inside. I nonchalantly walk across the opening in the wall, but freeze just after I pass. I press my back to the wall and sneak toward the opening. I listen for a few minutes, and finally convince myself that this is the time to be a man. A time to stand up to your incessant fears and just go in there, meet new people. I collect my thoughts and walk in.<br /><br />I find myself surrounded by a pack of older kids. I ask if this is robotics team. They say yes. I sit down.<br /><br />In my seat, I can't help feeling like I'm somehow in the wrong place. Everyone around me is a stranger, and the person who convinced me to come in the first place, Russell, isn't there. I fidget with my feet, and twiddle my pen as I try to look inconspicuous. Getting my feel for the room, I start to glance around. My newfound confidence is shattered as one of the older kids makes direct eye contact with me. I break, and look at the pen in my hand as I continue to fidget. I can't control my anxiety. Thirty minutes pass like this, as the leader of the group makes a presentation.<br /><br />Thirty minutes have passed, and I'm still cowering like a stupid animal. Thirty more minutes pass, and the meeting ends.<br /><br />A Sunday passes, and my social confidence is shattered. But, like you care. Hopefully I can get to know these older people so I don't have to be constantly reminded by body language that I'm an insubordinate.<br /><br />I have trouble meeting people.
