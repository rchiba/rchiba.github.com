How long have I been updating on this website?  Close to a year maybe? I dunno.  I just know One thing.....I might stop updating and make my own site.  BY MY SELF!!!!!!  I'm not in the best of moods today. I'm not going to say what the source of my anger is but Ryo knows seeing that I've have sent him multiple emails about it.  I might as well start thinking of good ideas for a website(sigh) I've nothing more to say abd I will inform you what my decision is when the time comes.
