Sorry, no time... So much to talk about. I will make up my non-posting by posting my speech for anyone to read. Like always, it is copyrighted and you cannot steal it. If you try to use it, my teacher will know. Now, read my speech...
<br />
<br />Based on many facts, research, and surveys, I believe that people should think twice before harassing or bullying anyone. First, this kind of bullying will affect the person being bullied. Secondly, bullying someone, believe it or not, affects the bully. Thirdly, bullying and the resulting consequences affect bystanders. 
<br />	You might think that bullying is not a problem or that it’s taboo to talk about it. Well, if these people, you should try to understand the future effects bullying causes. Bullying has three forms which are physical, verbal, and psychological. All three can cause prolonged negative stress which results in reactive depression. In turn, this can cause loss of self objectivity and even end up in suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that suicide is 3rd leading cause for young people. In 1996, 31,000 people successfully committed suicide in the United States. This is not a small problem. The National Institute of Child Heath and Human Development did a survey and found that 17% of the kids are bullied weekly. This translates into 1.6 million children being bullied each week. 
<br />	The bullies are also risking their future opportunities. Harassment is linked to vandalism, shoplifting, and fighting. I’m not saying that all bullies are going to become scandalous thieves in the future, but there is evidence to support the fact that bullies are risking their futures. Professor Dan Olwensin in Norway found that 60% of bullies in grades 6-9 were convicted of at least one crime during adulthood. This is very interesting considering that of the non-bullies, only 23% were convicted.
<br />	Bullies and the people being bullied aren’t the only ones being influenced. PTSD, depression, and various other illnesses that are caused by harassment cause workers to stay home, or not even try. In turn, this results in lost productivity and higher taxes. The World Heath Organization, World Bank, and Harvard found that mental illness cost 148 billion in 1990. Of this 148 billion, 22 billion was attributed to PTSD.  Also, this is not only in America, this problem is spreading worldwide. The UK Dep. Of Heath found that stress is the #1 cause of sickness absence. With 850,000 cases of PTSD and one person trying to suicide every half hour, our friends in Britain are having the same problem we are.
<br />	In conclusion, many people don’t think before they act. I want to change that. This problem probably won’t be solved so soon, but if we all make an effort, we can try to reduce the incidence of bullying and harassment. Even the small immoral things you do culminate into disaster. Every time you bully or harass someone, you not only hurt them, but yourself, and various others. Consider the facts before you act.
