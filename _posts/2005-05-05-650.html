Finally updated my book cards page. Stupid book cards. You know, I think the ammount of effort wasted on the creation of these book cards is completely absurd. Why don't they photocopy a good book card for us? Well, at least I'm helping the rebellion of people who want to resist like me. I hope my effort pays off and helps other people.<br /><br />I have found two biology articles. They are practically the same, but let's hope that the biology teacher does not notice.<br /><br />I don't have anything to say about the normal school day besides that Devin still needs to pay me back, so I'll talk about QuizBowl. I don't feel like a cohesive member of QuizBowl. It seems that whenever I can answer the question, I don't understand what's going on so I don't buzz. I get so confused and I have the tendancy to daydream while I scribble worthless nothings in my notebook. It's really effecting my performance. It makes me feel worthless compared to my peers. How unfortunate for me.<br /><br />I don't know how to start my OLC project/visual aid. I'm afraid that my controversial video will turn out offensive or look like a sham of pictures. I need software that I don't have. Perhaps I should take the normal approach of constructing a poster. But, constructing a poster is against my principles. It's a waste of paper, effort, and ink. I hate it. I hate posters. I hate posters.
