There was once was a bunch of boys and some girls and a nerd. These boys, girls, and nerd rode the same bus. While on the bus, these boys and girls talked. In the conversations there were outrageous tales, epic quests, and sick accusations. This annoyed the nerd. The nerd then realized that these boys and girls has a perturbed sense of what is "funny as h*ll", "f*cking sh*tty", and "s*cks d*ck". Thus, this nerd ignored them.
<br />
<br />It's really funny, but disturbing, when listening to your (I don't want to admit this) peers, because they have this illogical sense of thinking. To them, the more vulgarity you use, the more superior you are. It's funny, because they use vulgarity in stupid locations just to boost their superiority. It's disturbing, because these kids are going to adults someday. Adults that work in the society we call America. Whatever their problem is, I hope they work it out someday. I hope this illogical thinking is just a stage. Just a stage...
<br />
<br />I think my presentation was a success. People called it "funny", but I was still confused on if it was a negative "funny" or a positive "funny". I really hope it was a postitive "funny".
<br />
<br />Diving ended with a painful moment. A smack on my back while trying to do a front flip. My back feels like it has been smacked with a cricket paddle made for Nazis. Speaking of Nazis, can you believe they still exist. I can see how they seem persecuted (No one likes Nazis, except... well... Nazis) and how they see themselves as a minority, but I don't think that's a valid reason to create summer camps and communes dedicated to the hatred of foreigners and Jews. Questionable behavior...
