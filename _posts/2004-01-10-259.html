I've been crying, but it's stopped for a while now. That is so weak of me but I can't help it. I can't help it and my eyes are burning. It feels as though hot ash has been poured into them. They blurr and everything around me blurrs too. Maybe it is because I have not cried in so long. Maybe I should record what happened. My sister came over and she got depressed. I tried to get her to come inside when she went out in thin clothes and no shoes. I stayed out there without a coat, trying to make a point on what she was doing to us. Yet, it didn't work. She eventually came back in but then she went for the knives and couldn't stop crying. I was so frightened. Fighting has always frightened me. It reminds me of so many nights spent in terror on the couch. She hates us all. She thinks Mother loves me more, and she doesn't. They were so angry. I can't place anything anymore. I feel as though it is all my fault. I feel horrible... And I wish I could wake up from this nightmare. I want to wake up. No one will wake me up. I feel so lost. I don't want to be crying. I feel so trapped, just in a maze. Is this what is feels like to have your heart ripped out? To loose what you love? I don't know... I can't remember the time so long ago. The thing that should have never happened. The one thing that haunts me even when I'm awake. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to everyone. I'm sorry for everyone....I am sorry because sometimes smiling isn't enough.
<br />I just want to wake up.
