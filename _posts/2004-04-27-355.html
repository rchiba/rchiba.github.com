Finally, that Invention Convention is over...
<br />I think our group blew the others out of the water. (A few anyways.)
<br />Average Yo reporting...
<br />
<br />I can finally get back to the normal schedule of updating the site. Anyways, I was on the bus ride home and I heard something very sad. A girl's dad suggested they pull a prank on the school band teacher by using plastic wrap and wraping it outside the door. Now, That is sad.... An adult encouraging children to behave in such a manner is unwize and just dispicable. How? I just couldn't comprehend the stupidity of the matter. Then this girl starts telling everyone on the bus. I mean, all the band kids who would not tell. I was in the fray at that moment. Anyways, they were saying how she deserves it and how she degrades everyone, which is not so at all. I mean, these people are going out of there way to get a low salary to teach music to a bunch of ingrates who will hate them if they aren't "cool". I mean, how could these children hate this band teacher so much to pull a degrading prank? Are the teachers really that bad? I think these children should be educated in how LUCKY they actually are. These stupid ingrates do not think with logic, but with variables. If I pull so-and-so pranks on an "uncool" person, I will become x number of levels more popular. A dastardly incentive, don't you think? I think that in this country, people are oddly wired. I mean, I've been living here for 99% of my life and I still can't comprehend how people can tolerate, plan, and execute these ignorant acts of waste and idiocracy. I just can't comprehend how everyone is complaining about rising gasoline and higher taxes when fools are wasting toilet paper on throwing and plastic wrap on stupid, moronic, incompetent, useless, foolish acts. I mean, these people are doing on a MONTHLY basis, maybe even WEEKLY. If these idiots are going into the workforce like the way they are, who knows what the future will bring... Let's all dig a shelter and hide shall we?
<br />
<br />Will factories be shut down because workers complain about every possible thing? Will politicts lead to an immense civil war because people can't communicate without AIM?? Will America collapse? I don't know, but it seems sad you know? Sad because the word "cool" sometimes means "stupid". And since everyone wants to be cool, the world will become a place where idiots are rewarded, and logic criticized. These people anger me.
