Freshman Orientation. All the newbies to high school come together in the wonderful educational establishment that I sometimes call, "home". This year, they all got orange shirts, for free. Yes, <i>for free</i>. They look like nice shirts too. There are paper shortages during the school in the spring, but the school can afford to give away shirts to all of the incoming freshman? Absurd. <br /><br />But, don't listen to me. I'm just complaining because there was no such thing as "<i>Freshman Orientation</i>" when I first came to high school. What a boring time period I must have lived in. No free shirts, no cheesy inspirational speeches about high school life, no obnoxious forms to fill out. <br /><br />My job today was to help the robotics team recruit people. Four people showed up today to help promote the team, and if you look to your right (I've ridden <i>way</i> too many trolley tours) you'll see pictures of the team's attempt to capture the hearts and minds of the newbies. We drove the robot a little bit. Ran into a few kids, just slight bumps. Picked up a few foam balls. Impressed a select few, interested just as many. <br /><br />I put on a bandana on my head and over my mouth and ran through the cafeteria screaming, <i>"JOIN ROBOTICS! YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU DON'T!"</i> That turned a few heads.<br /><br />All in the name of trying to recruit new people. This year's robotics team is so very short on people, and if we don't get more people to jump on our boat, I'll have uncomfortable amounts of robotics work. If we don't get more people, I'll have to animate my brains out and jump around building things at the same time. So many things. I'll be so tired. I'll be so depressed. I don't care because I'm the animator and I've got to do my job.<br /><br />
