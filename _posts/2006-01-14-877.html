It's going to be tough for the next few days, being able to type out garbage every night as my mind dwindles between the realm of insanity and critical failure. The outlook is dreary. I imagine a world where I don't get to sleep until midnight, and have to wake up at 5am. It's a matter of what needs to be done. What needs to be done must be done, and if that is to happen, then I must suffer. <br /><br />Thusly, posting must be done. And if I have to go nuts doing it, then so be it.<br /><br />In other news, there's a nice large hard drive heading toward my house. Lovely. I love storage. I do lots of things on the computer, and it eats up space. On the "to-do list" for tomorrow is to go through and flush out the computer. Otherwise, I'll have a meltdown on my hands, or rather a large growl and beep from the innards of my desktop before it mysteriously reboots itself.<br /><br />Bah, it's so hard to type when you can't think and nothing has happened. <br /><br />So this will conclude the record of my Saturday, the 14th of January, 2006.
