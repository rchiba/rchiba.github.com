Finals were frustrating today. Everyone talks of "how easy" they were, when on the inside, I know that I perceived them as difficult. The finals that I took today mattered in terms of affecting my grade. They were and are the determining factor in the outcome of my grade. Talking to my peers during this time of year is the worst. Everyone is doing better than you, and the structure of the world seems to be collapsing. Everyone smiles and walks the walk, talks the talk, and I'm left in the dust, left to crawl under the nearest rock and hope for a painless execution. Except, the execution isn't so painless. Once the grades come in, the social antagonism associated with my failure to achieve what my peers are able to will sear me from the inside out. I'm already preparing myself for my inevitable failure.<br /><br />So, that's how I felt after French class. Demoralized and depressed. Defeated by my own mind, and myself being the reason for my misery did not help at all. I was a miserable person feeling miserable for making myself feel miserable. The rest of the study classes pass by like a dark cloud. I skip lunch and fall asleep in the chemistry room, only to wake up to darkness. The motion sensor didn't detect any movement, so it automatically shut off the lights. All of my classmates are out eating lunch, being merry and such. The room is black. The dull hum of the air conditioner lulls me back to my gloomy sleep.<br /><br />I am promptly awakened by my teacher fifteen minutes later. The students begin to filter back into the room. Finally, the teacher gets back up to the front of the room to answer more questions. As she spouts answers and explanations, I slump over my list of English terms. The English final is in twenty minutes, and my studying is going nowhere. All the negative emotions keep me from retaining information. Every attempt to memorize a term is blocked by a big, black brick of self-doubt and mindless angst. I realize that my mental state of affairs is irrational. This makes me feel even less intelligent.<br /><br />The bell rings and I mope my way to English class.<br /><br />The English teacher hands out some papers. I look down at them. Nothing out of the ordinary. But, after a second visual pass, I realize that a 100% score is scribbled out and to the side is written: <br /><br />"<i>see me</i>"<br /><br />I assume it's because she likes my paper, or because I have some problem in my paper that she has to explain to me. Either way, it appeared negligible, so I filed it back in my binder, making a mental note to see her after I finished the final.<br /><br />The first few questions were easy, a good attempt to lure me into a false sense of security. Then came the section on grammar terms that I had studied while in my depressed stupor. Frustration. I remembered reading <i>about</i> these terms, but the specifics were lost in my crusade against myself. A few whacks to the head do nothing. I'm stuck blind guessing. So, I put in random answers and move on. <br /><br />Just then, a student behind me brushes beside me. He discreetly drops a coin-sized piece of paper on my desk. I notice that there is pencil scribblings on it. I get excited. <br /><br />"<i>I've never gotten a note by another student during a final before</i>", I think to myself.<br /><br />I quietly open up the folded slip of paper. Excitement turns to a gripping fear as I read the note. On it is scrawled:<br /><br />"<i>She wants to 'see me' about my paper.<br />I think she knows I copied.<br /><u>Deny everything.</u></i>"<br /><br />I read the note again. And then one more time. As if the words on the paper will magically fly off of the paper, I read it again. I fold up the slip and put it under my test. I go back to the question I was on. As I try to read and answer the question, all my mind can think of is the three sentence message. I think back to all of the times when I've let people copy off of my papers. A few times indeed. I hate doing papers, so I figure that my efforts may as well spare others of the horror. I let people pass around my papers with self-satisfaction. But, every time I assume that my fellow students will change the wording so that they won't get caught. Unfortunately, I was not able to catch the face of the student who passed me the note. The person must have not changed the wording at all. <br /><br />My stomach cringes, I get dizzy, and try to list my options. I could follow the instructions on the note and act completely oblivious. After awhile, I figure that this is too suspicious, so I throw that option out. I could fess up and tell the teacher everything. After an equally long time of thinking, I decide that it would be dishonorable to do so. In effect, I would be committing treason to my fellow students. My third option is to make up a story about how I was sharing my unique viewpoints in my paper, when a student did more than just read it. Then, if she asked about the student, I would just say that it was too long ago to remember, that there were many people. This last option makes the most sense, so I take a big gulp, and get back to finishing my test. <br /><br />Fourty-five minutes later, I'm walking to the teacher's desk to turn in the test. I try to look calm in collected, as if a student hadn't passed me a secret note warning me of my fate. I walk back to my desk to make final preparations, think of a backup alibi, and collect my thoughts. I smoothly grab my paper, and nonchalantly walk back towards the teacher's desk. I give her my schpeel and she buys it all. I put on my most honest looking face, and hope that she doesn't suspect anything. Judging by her reaction, she doesn't. She gives me back all of my points, and tells me not to worry.<br /><br />I sit back in my chair and try to stifle my sigh of relief. Andrew taps me on the shoulder and asks me what that was all about.<br /><br />I tell him that he'll find out later.<br /><br />So I go home feeling lucky. Regrettably, this luck can't last long. Although tomorrow will be bright, my future grades won't reflect the same gloss. Nonetheless, I'll try to keep my head up. No point in drowning in the kiddie pool.
