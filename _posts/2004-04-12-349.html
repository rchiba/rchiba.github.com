Sorry for the Non-Updation Bloggie.
<br />I know your hungry so I decided to feed you today.
<br />Anyways, my excuse for not updating? It is that I am "obsessed" with a game called Gunbound. It is very tactical and free and over the internet. Perfect for me isn't it? My connection runs well on it too. The only problem is that it takes up alot of time since it's a turn based game. I was watching "Band of Brothers" last night on the History Channel. I liked it alot. I like to read and watch stuff about wars. I certainly don't want to be involved in any though. I just find all the effort put in by Average people like me into the war effort intreging. I mean, who would want to risk their lives to serve a country? I guess alot of people. Why fight in the first place. I guess it's inevitable though, you know humans. Anyways, Devin and I haven't met up for the commercial and I am in dire need of a camera man and some actors for my movie. Darn, am I angry. This movie stuff gets complicated. It started with a 2 person crew, but now I need more. Oh well...
<br />
<br />Anyways, tomorow I have to go to the dentist's office tomorow and it's really freaking me out because I have to leave school early. Unlike most kids I am infuriated when my schedules messed up for some appointment. I think I have some mental problem. Oh yea, I checked my out the MacintoshIIvx that's upstairs and it has 56 MB hard drive space. Sad isn't it. I mean, gunbound would take up 2 MacintoshIIvx's memories. Amazing...

<br />Bye...
