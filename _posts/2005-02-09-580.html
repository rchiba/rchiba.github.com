Amazing...
<br />
<br />I have willed myself to wake up an hour early to update my blog. I believe that I try to contradict myself subconciously. Maybe it's because I'm a teenager and teenagers are supposed to be angsty and contradictory. Obviously, all teenagers are angsty and contradictory, just like how all African Americans are basketball stars, and just like how all asians are nerds, and just like all...

<br />Well, I could go to diving and suffer my fate... I'll probably do that. Shoot, I just talked myself into going...
<br />
