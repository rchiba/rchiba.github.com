I may be riding the bus home for the first time in a long time tomorrow. At this notion, I am astonished and speechless. Currently, I don't know how to react. On one hand, such an early arrival home means an increase in leisure activities and a decrease in homework stress. On the other hand, the abrupt change in my schedule means that I won't have the opportunity to socialize with my robotics comrades and screw around with the computers in the back, not to mention not having anymore excuses for being an irritable jerk. <br /><br />When the pros and cons are weighed, I'll choose the bus any day.<br /><br />This weekend, I rate two thumbs up. I was able to get back into the few hobbies that I cling to. To do something new, I decided to rig a character in Blender and learn how to use the Non-Linear Action (NLA) system. The NLA system is actually a fancy term for organizing actions into blocks. Movements in 3D computer animation are recorded as keyframes, or distinct poses in which bones of a skeleton are positioned in certain points in an XYZ graph. Being the fearful, cautious person I am, I decided to try doing a simple walk cycle. A walk-cycle involves many keyframes. What the NLA system does is store all of the walk-cycle keyframes as one block action. When someone thinks of walking, one thinks of the single action of walking, not a series of interconnected poses. In theory, this system makes actions (like walking, waving a hand, jumping) much easier to manage. <br /><br />Or so they say. I spent two hours trying to find out how to get more than one block action to take place. In the end, I found out that I had to click a little button that was visible to me the whole time. Frustration combined with victory was never so sweet.<br /><br />In other news, I'm listening to Bruce Springsteen. It's refreshing to hear something new.
