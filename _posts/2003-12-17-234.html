After walking away from the classroom today, I thought, "gee, that final was easy, I wish I was at a private school" and I never was satisfied. I thought it was fun. Anyways, I did my speech in communications today and I think it went well. It was on pet peeves. I announced that I hate people who complain about pointless things, people who get paid for getting good grades, and people who waste money on trivial materialistic items. That was the only things that were important today. 
<br />
<br />In homeroom today, the idiot monkeys (my classmates) kept on disturbing the peace. I think those monkeys should pipe down and let us all read for today was "reading day". It is sad how the society factor plays in to how cool people are. "cool" people stare at a blank page in the book just to defy those in powers. How they waste their time is truly depressing. It goes to show you how stupid the society at school works. I shouldn't even say works. It more or less deplores.
<br />
<br />Today at lunch, I saw a fellow classmate being told not to bring tape recorder to school. I must work more covertly, for the same fate cannot be enshrined to me. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I have to go
<br />BYE
