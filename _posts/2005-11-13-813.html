Right now, as I sit here in front of my trusty, aged laptop, past my designated sleeping time, I'm experimenting with FurryMUCK. <br /><br />I've heard stories of intense obsession with this primitive form of a massively multiplayer online game. I've found that there are 330 people on right now, but I've yet to understand how this is all supposed to work out. <br /><br />MUCK stands for... Well, I know that it's Multi-User-somethingsomething. MUD stands for Multi-User-Dungeon, and I'm assuming FurryMUCK and MUD's are basically the same thing. <br /><br />I want to explore this furry fandom subculture further, and I think the only way to do so is to delve into the darkness of primitive chatrooms and ages old online forums. But, alas, I've found the holy grail of Furry Fandom. The FurryMUCK.<br /><br />And so, I should be getting to sleep soon. But, tomorrow, I will venture into the FurryMUCK and see what I can find. If I deem it awesome, I'll put a link up.<br /><br />*Note: I updated my art.
