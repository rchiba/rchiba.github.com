I spent my muggy evening relaxing and playing furcadia.<br /><br />I met up with Amanda and Ryan and we chatted for a full two hours. It was great fun. <br /><br />Before that though, I was at Ryan's house trying to configure the darned TiVo. I'm really getting agitated by the thing, and am thinking of assassinating it somehow.<br /><br />I'm tired, so I'll stop before I collapse. About a full week with little sleep, can it go on?
