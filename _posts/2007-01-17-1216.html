Haven't posted in awhile.<br /><br />Now that I know people are reading this, the writing has become a lot less personal. That pisses me right off. Nowadays, feel the urge to hide what I say, even at home, staring at this anonymous blank text box. What if I say something that is misinterpretted? What if someone gets angry at me for saying this-or-that? Life isn't all optimistic and full of dainty little elves throwing chocolates. It's full of some bad things. Of course, I reveal them here and then my act's exposed, eh?<br /><br />When so many people know who I pretend to be, who I am, who I'm not, I just feel so shallow. Deep people are modest, they don't go and flaunt their emotions online. It's sickening. It's absurd. And here I am. I must be the most shallow person on Earth. Always trying to fish for compliments, trying to boost my ego, and finding nothing <span style="font-style: italic;">real</span>. It's like this twisted, selfish, idiotic passion of mine or something.<br /><br />You know?
