The beginnings of anti-consumerism, Buy Nothing Day.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the cry of consumer advocates like Adbusters couldn't stop the masses of people from going out to get the "Early Bird" specials this morning. I mean, even I was out there getting me one of those $14 DVD players. Yes, Buy Nothing Day might make a tiny difference, but I suppose that it will never be able to convince the behemoth consumer to change its ways. Buy Nothing Day is like a pebble, and the consumers are the tidal wave.
<br />
<br />I'm currently filled with a anarchic wave of euphoric rage and fear. It is Friday night, and there are only two more days until school starts. It is a very stressful time when your free time is spent insanely worrying about the free time ending. I am angry. I don't want it to end. I want to pretend that it will never end, but I can't. It will stop. That is why I am afraid, angry, filled with rage and fear. Vacation is nice, if you can avoid worrying about it ending. For me, it is unbearable. I feel compressed. Compressed and contorted, subjected to high ammounts of stress, like a tennis ball that has been in one too many tennis matches. I feel like a compressed can of air, about to explode. 
<br />
<br />Help. Sleep might help.
