The guy gets the girl. The celebrity finds acclaim. The technician finds purpose.<br /><br />Some people become winners. Others have to wait.<br /><br />At the robotics national tournament, everybody was a loser, some more than others. A few successes existed to offset this.<br /><br />I hate talking about other people, but I do so only because if I don't, then these thoughts will nag me until I either have a mental breakdown, or don't get enough sleep to be capable of memory (recently, there has been more of the later). <br /><br />Rus worked so hard. Of course, I couldn't see him work. He would stay in the secluded pit area, tending to stray judges, working hard to sway their votes toward our robotics team. He had a mission. He was to present our team as the best team, in both technical and moral fields. He was to add a face to a number, a personality to a cold, heartless machine. And so he did so with a passion.<br /><br />I shared a room with Rus. I also was in a room with the driver of the robot, and a stray programmer. Together, they would show me how people interact. Every night, we would enter our room together, exhausted. The room smelled faintly of smoke and cleaning solution. An aromatic stain on a nonsmoking designated room. The lamps, they dimly light two beds, a pine nightstand, and a flimsy table. The walls are orange, the picture on the wall is of a generic landscape. The room itself is much like this generic landscape. It is so ordinary, as if all the cheap hotel rooms in the world could pass as this one.<br /><br />And so we would sit down in the beds, the driver and Rus, making snide comments to each other, the programmer tapping on the pine table, and me running to the front desk to put down a twenty dollar deposit on an ethernet cable. I come back to find Rus proclaiming is accomplishments of the day, never ceasing to mention the fact that he had not urinated for the whole day because of how hard he was working. I mentioned that I had brought the cable to give us access to the Internet. He comments on how I pronounce ethernet. I learn then that I have been pronouncing yet another word incorrectly for god knows how long. Then he goes back to telling all of us how he used his immeasurably sharp wits to woo judges. I turn around organize the pine table, which is now covered in empty cans, plastic bags, and trinkets.<br /><br />I just couldn't stop thinking to myself, <i>"If he's so <b>fucking</b> amazing, then why can't he help me keep the room clean?" </i><br /><br />Keeping my thoughts to myself, I took a shower and tried to wash away my envy. Envy of what, you ask? I keep telling myself that there's nothing to envy. That he's just like me, that I shouldn't complain for where I'm at. But, the fact of the matter is, Rus does more than I do. He is rewarded for his success, and there's nothing wrong with that. It bothers me that he enjoys constantly telling those around him about his success, but perhaps there is nothing wrong with this either. His dedication to the Boy Scouts has led to many powerful connections. His determination and curiosity has led to him knowing just enough more than I do about computers to frustrate me. His persuasive skills gleam while listening to his conversations with people who are more important than he is. Competitive speaking has given him wit, and a thorough knowledge of current events. His very DNA has made him taller and stronger than average.<br /><br />And so the story continues.<br /><br />I trudged out of the bathroom ready to sleep. Rus is flopped on the other bed next to a girl from the West Lafayette team. He showed her a few funny movies, and told me to join in, and I did. Every once in awhile, he would make a witty comment and that would cause the girl to laugh. I would just sit there awkwardly watching the bland viral videos. Then, Rus had the bravado to watch a viral video that made fun of asians. Ironically, it would end up being about how asian males are not appealing to the other gender. I laughed with the programmer, the driver, Rus, and the girl to fit in. Inside, I wanted to kill everyone in the room, and die at the same time. The dagger of racism provoking me to take steps to resort to physical violence. And so the short video ended and I collapsed onto the bed. For awhile, I debated picking up the floor lamp and attempting to bludgeon Rus to death, but I decided against it. The girl eventually left, but the nagging, primal envy sat in bed next to me as I tried to get to sleep.<br /><br />Skip a few days, and we're all on the bus. The engine rumbled to a start, and I'm sitting in the very back seat. Rus is sitting next to me. As the bus begins to move out of the parking lot, I noticed that the girl I mentioned earlier was walking toward Rus and I. Being the anti-social person that I am, I curled up in a ball and turned up the volume on my cd player, trying to stave away my emotions with the valiant sword of music. It didn't work. The two began talking in their suave, sophisticated language. And I somehow forced myself to sleep with only the torn rags of my sanity left.<br /><br />Hours later, we all are sitting in the back, Rus, the girl, and I. I awake from my sleep. The blue light above the nearby lavatory is the only thing that illuminates our seats. I notice something.<br /><br />The girl is curled up on Rus, and his arm is around hers. Very cliche, but it couldn't be any closer to reality. The blue glow of the light on their hair and clothes only adds to the surrealness of the whole scene. Confused and groggy, I just stare at them and don't really know what to think. After a few minutes of collecting my thoughts and returning my mind to a working state, I say to myself, <i>"He has everything. And there's not a single thing I can ever do to ever be as successful as he is."</i><br /><br />And with that, I put my head on the cold bus window and tried to accept myself for who I am, and not for who I'm not.
