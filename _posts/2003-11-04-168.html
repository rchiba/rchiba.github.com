Today, I was saved by the one and only Kara Bartolone.
<br />I am forever indebted to her because she took the time and effort to get my backpack(that I REALLY REALLY Need for tommorow) that i forgot and bring it to my house. I AM SOO HAPPY! REJOICE. If you're reading this, whenever you see Kara, be nice, give her a hi-five or something.  Anyways, It all happened at the huge band festival at Wea Ridge. It's just like an average concert except 5 times BIGGER!!! THERE WERE 39 CLARINETS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.!!! It all went well, but I now know that Klondike is full of obnoxious fat pricks. The only conversation starters are either vulgar accusations or they flick you off. It's very depressing. Ok, I think I have to go to sleep now.
