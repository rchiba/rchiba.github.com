Today was a day of anger, like every other day.
<br />This is the Average Yo,
<br />Anyways, COMM (short for communication) is always interesting. The teacher got everyone into new seats. I hate the table I sit at. Ok here's the scenario. I was sitting at the cheap semi-wood table with 4 other people. The teacher told us to get out our homework. Just like every day, everyone was too retarded to actually DO their homework. Of course, I actually had the motivation to DO my homework. Morgan, a girl who sits next to me, wants to copy off of me. I think that she is a totally fraudulent freak, but I calmly said no. I said that I spent 30 minuites on my homework and that she is not justified to let her have the answers because all my effort would be wasted if this happened. She freaked out, told this kid named Tony who sits accross from her, and then he tells me to "chill out" and "shut up". I cannot see what I did wrong in this situation and I calmly stated everything. To give away the answers would be a fraudulent thing to do, and it would also violate the contract between me and the school. Anyways, Tony and Morgan start getting angry at me. I ask why, because I did nothing, and they told me to "shut up". Then, they start showering me with choice words. Great, I have to shut up and I have no way of defending myself. All because of not giving my homework answers to this girl who sits next to me in Communications. I went out of that room thinking of all the stupid people at school and wondering why I was stuck in this H*llhole. Of course, this school I go to does wonders to my confidence.

<br />Miles Hunley said that he went to my site. I really doubt it because he said there were pictures of "Rubber Ducks" on it. I think that he is a totall liar, but he has potential. That is only if he changes his routine soon. I still love school, but I hate the strings attached to it (eg. homework, extracurricular stuff, stupid morons, etc.) 
<br />
<br />Anyways, this weekend is going to be spent on working on a school project with Ryan Auspaugh and going to Mathcounts and studying for the ACTs. In my spare time on Sunday, I plan to make a incinerary box (A cardboard box with aluminum foil covering it) and plan to BURN my school papers in it. I can always relieve stress that way! Burn BABY BURN! Well, hopefully the cardboard box won't catch on fire and burn my house down. I better do it near a hose. Also, I think I might also do it at night and use it as a campfire. When I'm done, I can just throw the thing away so I don't have to mess with the ashes. I call it the disposable incineration device! I feel special now. I am soon to be off to Ryan's house so I better get off and try to remember if I forgot anything that i have to do. I am still trying to decide if I should spend the night a Ryan's house or just stay there for a while. I NEED TO DECIDE! Well, that's it for today!
