This week/weekend has been frentic. I couldn't type for a long time. It seems that it's going to keep on getting frentic (is that a word?). Anyways, I 've got a ton of stuff to do and not a long time. Actually, I have a bit of time, but I don't have the determination ***looks off of speech*** and optimism to renew my vigor for the endless struggles for my life goals. Anyways, I am tracking Devin on these weird Final Fantasy Forums. I am going to watch him. It seems him, Oliver, and Karl are prominent members in this cyber society. Of course, I don't contribute to these societies because I DONT HAVE TIME. I took the Hobbit test today and it was confusing. I couldn't have gotten a A. I should start running.

<br />Anyways, I'm going to Ryan's house tomorow and we're just going to hang out. Cool, I get to *hang out*. Does that make me "cool"? HAHAHAH Cool people are so stupid. That's so funny. Anyways, these people and Communications class are slow, in mind and physically. They just loiter in the hallways and block the hallways at various key junctions in the school. Eventually you have a ton of people and not any room because a few morons are just talking in the middle. This results in people not getting to class in time.

<br />There's this teacher that was a substitute who was a student teacher for another class earlier in the year. People really hate him for some reason. They can't stop harassing him and talking about horrid things that make no sense behind his back. He never did anything wrong or did anything that hurt anyone. Working for a low wage, and teaching kids who hate you would bring me personally to the point of insanity. If I was him, I would have killed myself or found another profession long before now. I can't believe that everyone hates him. I can't believe how mean people are. I guess that's what makes everyone so stupid, and that's how car salesmen get so rich. So I guess I shouldn't be complaining. Dumb, morons fuel the economy and the upper class. I'll just let them be dumb and let them rot in their own filth. Filthy creatures, aren't they.
