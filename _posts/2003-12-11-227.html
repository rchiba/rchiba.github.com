SO, how demented is culture today? very demented!
<br />I don't have time to explain, but I'm planning to write a opinion sometime this month. I am so buisy right now though. I have a ton of projects and not to mention the final exam. I don't have much time. I wish I had more time on myself, ive got so many things to talk about and no time to type clearly. Well, that is all!
