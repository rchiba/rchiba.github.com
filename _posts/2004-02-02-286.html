Hello, blog-thing. What's up? Nothing? Yay for you. Want me to tell you about my day? Whatever. My head has been hurting a lot. I guess it's what I get for thinking too much. I've been working on about four plot lines for a long time and unscrambling problems with my computer. Not to mention I have the added stress of a new occupant in the house, Kurt's son Brandon Lee. He's cool, I'm just not Ok with a lot of people. Then there was the added discomfort of intoxication issues. Thank goodness I didn't go down stairs when Brandon Lee did....
<br />Anyways, I am just chilling I guess. I've been reading a lot. I guess I am slightly insulted by lots of comments thrown my way. My head is still spinning from some of those. Ugh, if it gets too bad I'm just going to take some aspirin and suck it up.
<br />Anyways, I've been working my butt off on my books. I'm waiting on my editor to get Part 1 back to me while I work on part two Middleverse. However, I dunno how long I'll get with Brandon Lee here. Man I wish I had a really good laptop like Ryo O_O
<br />Oh well, I preparing my mental forces for Kelly's birthday party. I'm not too sure on the swimming, but I am definently going to try and put work aside to have some fun. I guess I really shouldn't have grown up so fast, but it isn't really my fault...
<br />Anyway, I did a nice oekaki(SP) centering around my last post. It's quite interesting. I animated the creatures in my head.
<br />Well, anyways, a whole bunch of stress is weighting me down. I'm still trying to get over last night. I really don't like Super Bowl Sunday. Or any holiday for that matter. That's usually when intoxication issues get worse. Maybe I should make a internet support group @_@ lol. 
<br />Anyway, I'm working adamantly on another story that I'm thinking of calling "Prisoners of Pirates". I'm still unsure of the title, I'm really bad at them. 
<br />Of course, then there is this really nagging guilt on me. I didn't do too well on the Science multiple choice thing because when I did it, we hadn't done anything to aid us in understanding. So that's why I protest Mr. mann's methods. He should give us the notes first, it's easier to pick out the key factors. Because now, I bet I'd get every single one of those things right.
<br />Anyway, enough complaining. In response to ryo, who thinks his life is so bland; I ENVY YOU! Look! I'm turnin' green with envy over here! Man, you have no clue how much I miss the nice, peaceful, and most importantly-quiet life on the farm. Sure the nights weren't so great, the roosters were evil, and the goats really loved to kick you in the butt, literally, but it was better than dealing with a lot of what I am going through now ;_;
<br />Anyways, in some ways I don't miss the old life. It was pretty much as miserable as this one. Lots of fighting. 
<br />That brings me to why I posted the whole big paragraph the other day. To those that read, it probably seemed as though I'm off my rocker. But it's true, I haven't experienced such things and so it's weird. It's still weird, uncomfortable, but I'm happy for them. 
<br />Anyways, the above paragraph was for Mrs. Kerr. She asks me if I'm Ok with the marriage, and I am. Really. I think. I guess it's because my head is in a whirl right now and I've seen so many failed relationships, that probably makes me unsure. But as long as I'm more positive than negative, that's great.
<br />Anyway (man I say that a lot) Kurt made me a pool stick and they're discussing my game discreetly. I beat Kurt, and I only started playing pool again about three days ago. Kurt had been playing about every night all his life. Now that, is kinda cool. It's really mathematical. It's fun when the right music is on as well.
<br />Well, that's my life, my head's a throbbing so I'm out.
<br />~Amanda
<br />P.S. HULLO JUSTIN! (just thought I'd say that so you wouldn't feel left out)
