Listening to light piano music, I always conjure up the urge to jump in front of a piano and start playing. I greatly enjoy listening to the mellow blends of tones, rhythmic tapping, quarreling higher-pitched notes, flittering and twittering and doing all sorts of flexible things that I didn't know music could do. And so for those moments, I yearn again how to produce music.<br /><br />That day is over in my life, but occasionally I satisfy my pathetic urge by reaching into my desk cabinet and pulling out a light blue, plastic pianica. Piano-harmonica. Sort of like a bagpipe-accordion combination really. Carefully blowing faint puffs of air into the mouthpiece, careful not to let my parents hear, I create my random notes. They ring unpleasantly, the harsh texture of the noise coming out of the end with each press of a key. Not music, but noise. But, I pretend that I'm a musician, and my lusting is temporarily satiated.<br /><br />Really, I've always wanted to learn how to play accordion. Not a clarinet, no saxophone for me. Trumpets are so mainstream. Accordions, they are crude, but somehow romantic, sometimes peaceful, other times intense. It's a dynamic instrument. Like dynamic people.<br /><br />Dynamic people can manage their time and look suave at the same time. Stress is no problem for their flexibility. Mental capability, emotional capability, physical capability. They can earn a million dollars of trust in five minutes, can entertain a crowd for hours, can manage relationships for years. Dynamic people...<br /><br />There are dynamic people all around me. Sometimes they're in clumps, and sometimes they talk about what sorts of amazing, super-human things they've accomplished in the past few days. Things that I haven't done, couldn't do. These people are above me, and it isn't a glass ceiling I'm under persay, I see it as more of a multi-layer, bulletproof, fire-resistant, plexiglass shield. <br /><br />I still get bothered when I look through it. I've tried not looking up, but it's hard not to when there's so much going on up there. It's hard not to gaze up and wonder why you are so stupid as to have fallen through the trap door. I've tried accepting the facts, but sometimes I struggle.<br /><br />I apologize.
