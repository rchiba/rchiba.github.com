I ate too much.<br /><br />After eating a very small brunch and working six hours in the sun, I was <strike>on the verge of starvation</strike> very hungry as I biked home at around 9:00pm. I get home and there's a table full of leftover food. Since everyone else in my family has already eaten, I don't have to worry about consuming in moderation. <br /><br />So, I eat. And eat. And eat. I get tired of eating, but I eat some more anyways because I have nothing better to do. Then, I start to walk away from the table, but I come back within five minutes to eat more. Food dances around the table. I have a psychedelic hallucination and the floor turns to green orbular grapes and flying latex gloves. I fall into the floor and spin around for awhile. I wake up from the nonsense that I write with a gut feeling. But this is no instinctive sensation. <br /><br />Like I said, I ate too much.<br /><br />And, even in my room, I'm having urges to chew things. <br /><br />For example, my bottle of "all-purpose" glue:<br /><img src="http://img144.imageshack.us/img144/3517/p1010008dl3.jpg" title="" width="400" border="0"><br />-<i>No, I'm not a pathetic, depressed paste-sniffing ruffian. The lighting just makes it look like I am. Yes, I speak the truth.</i><br /><br />I remember chewing things as a little kid. Sometimes it would be the collar of my shirt. I used to have a baggy navy blue shirt that I wore all the time. Got it from a garage sale. Months and months of chewing the collar ruined the thing. I even admit to chewing window sills. Little did I know that paint was <i>not</i> kid-intestine-friendly. The getting deadly paint chips in my mouth was worth it for the wonderful experience of gnawing the window sill. Ruined a few of those as well. Parents weren't so happy. Although, I can always blame them for never buying me gum at the local K-Mart. I would always ask for gum in the checkout lane, but never would they say yes.<br /><br />A traumatized child with a bad habit, or a mysterious glue bottle-biting phantom menace? You tell me.
