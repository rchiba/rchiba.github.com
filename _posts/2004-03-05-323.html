Today is a great day. With windy conditions, a perfect room temperature atmosphere, and sun, but not too much of it, today is looking good! Too bad that I have nothing to do outside. Well, i'm in my computer/sunroom right now. It has all of these windows and stuff, so I decided to open them. As the fresh air blows into the room, I can comfortably type at my own pace. I have time now to rant on and on.
<br />Average Yo reporting,
<br />today was good. In a great many years have I not felt this good. I feel empowered and fresh. The feeling is fantastic. It's like I'm not the same old angry crusader I was before, but more like a modest comforming person. I think maybe it's the air, or maybe...  it's the fact that I was in optimist club oratorical contest. I look around me and everyone is angryish. Anyways, I don't get as angry anymore. I just adapt. That's not to say that I don't EVER get angry, it's just that I am more a conformist.

<br />Anyways, there's this girl who told me if I knew 6 with an "exclaimation point thingie" or how she called it. Of course, me not knowing 6 factorial, I said that I don't know. She started proclaiming profoundly that she was smarter than me and that, even though I was in advanced math, she was "smarter" than me. Now, isn't that a bit outrageous? She memorized 6 factorial, asks some joe on the corner what it is. When the person doesn't know it, the just start proclaiming that she is smarter. I ask, what is "smartness", or "intelligence"? Define me that! No, it's not IQ because IQ was just a test. A test cannot measure "smartness". This "smartness" is actually a very general term that defines anything that requires thinking. ALOT of things REQUIRE thinking. Now, I think that when people say, "I'm smarter than you", that person is just making a general statement that, "my life is more useful, more purposeful, more valuable, than yours". Now, if you said that, that isn't true, so wouldn't saying that "I'm smarter than you" not be true also. I hate it when people say things they don't understand, or things that they never really think about. They are just oblivious to the fact that you should think before you say something. I just don't like that kind of thinking, you know?

<br />Anyways, that's enough ranting for now. Bye bye;)
