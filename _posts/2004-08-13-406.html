Average Yo reporting.
<br />
<br />The orientation was sub-par, just a bunch of inspirational non-sense. He mostly talked about how we were "Raiders" now and that would help us function better. He can't tell me who I am. "Raiders"? I have to know what a "raider" is before joining this supposed group. I saw alot of my old lunch table friends, but otherwise, unspectacular.
<br />
<br />Right now I'm at this bonfire party hosted by jessi hoffmann. It's rather large and has a bonfire and all... but everything is terribly dark. I gues it's the new fashon. Dark... grey...darkness. Nothing much color.
<br />
<br />On another note, NEVER bring brady to a party!
