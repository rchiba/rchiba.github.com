O.k., so yesterday I kinda had a blog fit/rant. So sue me here people, I am stressed! 
<br />O.k., no more rants, be happy Amanda be happy.
<br />Stop staring at me!
<br />The person in my head says stop staring, we are not talking to ourselves!!!
<br />lol... joking
<br />Mom is making spaghetti, yay?
<br />*Sigh* sorry I'm not enthused as I should be. It's just Kurt (my mom's fiance') is changing everything, and it just, well, feels different. I mean, I like the guy and all, it is just.. Well. I'm not a big fan of guys in particular unless they have proven to be trustful which Kurt has, it's just... I'm not sure I want things to change. I like the way we do things, the way it was an all female house, the way things balance out (sorta). I mean, he's even changing the way we eat... and I guess it's sorta freaking me out.
<br />Forgive me, I know I'm being quite irrational and probably selfish, it's just hard. I'm not sure if I really am ready for this marriage.
<br />
<br />~Amanda
