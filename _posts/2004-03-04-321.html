hey everyone, how ya all doin'.  I'm doin fine.  I cna't wait 'til Friday is over.  I'll tell you why...It's the end of the 9 weeks and I'll finally be out of the dreaded Foreign Language class.  HOORAYY!!!!  To me, the teacher that teaches it makes the class absolutely horrible.  I mean, today, we had to sing, yes, sing about plucking a dove.  Yeah, pretty dumb isn't it?  And to make even worse (if that's possible) we have to DANCE!!!:(  Why should we have to dance to some stupid French music.  Not to mention learning about France itself.  I don't get why we have to learn about France.  It's Foreign Language for heavens sake!!!  Not Foreign Country!!!  If it was then i wouldn't mind as much.   But it ISN'T!!!!  Well, I guess I'll stop talking about Foreign Language now and move on to Math.  No I like math much more than Foreign Language.  And I mean MUCH more.  Anyways, we just had this test that counted as a test AND quiz for our report cards.  So knowing this, we had to get good grades.  Well, I did just that and got a 108%.  Yes a 108%.  I am so happy.  But I saw someone else's grade (I'm telling who) and it had to be the worst grade in the whole 8th grade.  There were 12 problems and each was 9 points (thats how I got my grade) and the person I am talking about got a 2 out of 12.  That's less than 20%.  I'm really not trying to be mean here.  I just couldn't believe it.  and the stuff the test was over was like the easiest stuff we've done this year!  To me, the math teacher trying to give us a really good grade for the mid-terms and some people jsut blew it.  It's impossible to tell you why but all I know is that they just done care and don't try.  I know a couple people who I already know wont make it to 9th grade and if they do, it's by pure luck, and I mean PURE LUCK.
<br />Well that's all for now, I jsut have one question...does tomorrow ever come?
