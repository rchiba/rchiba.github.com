I got my Time magazine today, and I found this issue to be about this year's "most amazing inventions". <br /><br />Immediately, I thought to myself, "Not another stupid article about over-hyped, useless inventions designed to make the layperson excited about the future."<br /><br />But, it seems this week's issue <em>is indeed</em> about over-hyped, useless inventions.<br /><br />And as I was reading through this magazine, I was disgusted with the choices of inventions to showcase. The graphical showcase of inventions is a prime example of irrational orders of priority.<br /><br />Let's see what's on the cover of the magazine. The biggest picture undoubtedly goes to the cloned dog. That makes sense. I approve of this "invention".<br /><br />The second biggest picture is of a robot developed by Toshiba. What does this robot do? Well, according to the description, the robot follows people.<br /><br />No, really. That's all it does. It doesn't come with a new fandangled media player, it doesn't come with life-saving emergency medical equipment, and it sure doesn't come with a back up battery. So, what's the point of a robot that follows you? Well, I'm sure there's a reason for it existing, but what I find absurd is that this "follow me" robot gets a bigger spot than a number of truely useful inventions that should have taken top spot.<br /><br />Other things on the cover page include a foldable keyboard, a satellite radio player, a concept-vehicle, a robotic hand, and a plastic mask. <br /><br />Yes, a plastic mask. It's shaped like a happy face and basically, the only thing you can do with it is put it on, look into your bathroom mirror, and realize how stupid you are for calling it one of the "most amazing inventions of 2005". <br /><br />No where on the cover page is the "LifeStraw" that is mentioned in a tiny, 1/5 page blurb deep in the article. This is a straw that filters drinking water to make it safe for drinking. <br /><br />2 million people die of waterborne illness a year. This $3 straw could save these people. And the "follow me" robot and the idiotic plastic mask are shown more than this!? It's absurd that someone would celebrate such an idiotic "invention", if you can even call it that, like a plastic mask shaped like a happy face. <br /><br />The happy face mask has no chance to save 2 million people. The "follow me" robot has no chance to save 2 million people. Even the cloned dog has no chance to save 2 million people. But, this amazing "LifeStraw" can! Why is it pushed aside in the article to make room for big pictures of the "Xbox360" and the "PSP"? How can one value game consoles with a higher esteem than a life saving device!? <br /><br />I'm sickened by this. We, the people of the post-industrial world are too busy gawking at robots and playing console games to help dying people in pre-industrial nations. <br /><br />And that is absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />Time magazine, shame on you.
