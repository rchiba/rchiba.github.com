Haha, I'm still laughin' at those SPAMMERS. hahaha. All the stuff they spam with isn't pertinent to the subject, and I have not said anything bad about anyone. If you wanna send me a hate letter, send it to me personally at averageyo@mostlysunny.com . OK? Anyways, HAPPY BIRTHDAY MATT LUCASAC. Sorry, I forgot how to spell your last name. Anyways, it's his birthday so YAAY! So, whats been happening today? not much... I did go to the lego league though, lots of walking around in the classroom.  What to talk about?.... Oh yea, lets talk about dem spammas. I LAUGH AT YOU SPAMMERS, YOUR INTELLECT IS ALMOST NONEXISTANT, HAHAHAHaaaaaa... Ok, enough of that...  Oh yea, I gotta remember to send Mr. Rice a picture of me at the movie theatre with a cow costume on. That picture is a keeper. Ok, i'm running out of things to say so I better leave, tata
