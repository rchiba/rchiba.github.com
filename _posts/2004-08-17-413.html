Today was the first day of high school. Actually, it hardly constituted for a day because it was only for the afternoon, but it was truly a new experience for me, as well as many others. We just went over some technical stuff today. Mostly rules, guidelines, more rules, etc. I have:
<br />Honors Geometry: Probably the hardest class with the most work. I have to brave this to continue through the day.
<br />Band: Another hard-seeming class. This year we have mandatory ISSMA contests and the competition is overwhelming.
<br />French: A fun class with a nice teacher. I will be learning a skill that will be useful. Plus, I have Ryan in my class.
<br />Honors English: Another fun-seeming one with a nice teacher. I got some books that we needed at barnes&noble today. I've been reading one.
<br />Journalism: One of my "extra" classes that I took so I could write better posts here. Seems enjoyable, but has lots of older kids. Scary, older kids.
<br />Lunch: My old East Tipp lunch table groupies got together. Very relaxing.
<br />Advanced Biology: Seemed fun with an intelligent teacher, but she made it seem intimidating. I'm ready for a challenge.
<br />Study Hall: Way too big, plus the popular kids do anything but study. I'm sitting next to Ryan.
<br />
<br />Overall, the day went well. The school was extremely crowded and there was much congestion among peers as lunch B was progressing. It was shoulder to shoulder, neck in neck. The pace was about as fast as a rolling banana. One step at a time. At lunch, I somehow found myself with the same people as my old East Tipp lunch table. It was miraculaous. Now I can talk to Karl and Zach and Miles (???) while eating lunch. I saw alot of people who didn't have their friends in this lunch just wandering around the lunch room looking for an acceptable place to sit. I was one of the lucky few who didn't have to do this tedious cat-and-mouse game. Find a table- be rejected- try to find another table-get rejected-get pushed down-get rejected-etc. Anyways, tomorow will hopefully proceed as planned. Oh yea, did I mention that I almost got lost and was unable to find my bus?
