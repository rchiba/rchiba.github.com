If I don't post this soon, it'll be tomorrow already. Midnight is fast approaching, like a deft leaf slicing through the crisp, winter air. Surprisingly, the temperature in my room is very mild. This makes me happy. I like it when I get the atmosphere just right. Dim yellow lights, recently disinfected citrus odor, light jazz, a glowing laptop screen. The whole feeling in my room is just so positive. This is surprising as well, because I do a number of negative things in my room, such as gripe about homework. <br /><br />I guess sometimes good vibes come from the oddest of spots.<br /><br />Occasionally, I talk to people at school. Every once in awhile, the person I converse with will catch me at the wrong time, and I'll sometimes be impolite or be ruffled. Afterwards, I usually think about what happened, and how I'm such a decrepit fool for being in such a low morale. <br /><br />This contemplation makes me hate myself even more. <br /><br />After all, what's the point of thinking of the past if it has already happened? Well, for one thing, one can learn from the mistakes of the past.<br /><br />But, what frustrates me is that I never learn. There is always *something* that will put me in a bad mood, and then I start to be insensitive and angry. Usually it'll be something stupid, like a mistake on a math problem, or the fact that I'm never going to catch up to some of my peers in a reading assignment. So, each time something like this happens, it's the whole messed-up cycle of self-contempt and general lethargy.<br /><br />I can't lie, school is draining me. <br /><br />I cannot escape it.
