Ok, This is the Average Yo here.
<br />I'm running a bit short on time. If I type for about 30 more minuites from now, I will get 7 hours of sleep, which isn't advisable since I have to go to a Math Counts meeting next morning. I really feel stupid at those meetings because I am in 8th grade and all the other 7th graders are way more knowledgeable at the subject of math. Anyways, I've gotten to write my optimist club speech. It is turning out quite nicely, but I need to make it aproximately 4 minuites, and I haven't come close to that. I guess it's a start though...

<br />There's this outrageous program at school that the "School Board" has issued all the schools to do. It's called AA. Not alcoholics anonymous, no, even worse. To top it all off, it is mandatory every monday. This monday she explained it and it seemed like a piece of crap schedule. We talk about subjects like "happiness", and "respect". This is so stupid. Unlike other people, I have morals and I don't want to participate in this idiotic propaganda nonsense. My schedule is already packed, and now this stupid AA routine takes up my time. AA is causing me to get 7 hours of sleep tonight because I have to type about how angry I am about it right here, not to mention all the lost homework time. I hate this idiotic waste of my precious time. If you look up at the counter above, you can see that I hate wasting my time because I only have that many days to live. This AA thing is stagnant of mediocre moral teachers. If people want to harass people, that's fine with me, just as long as it's not me. This stupid AA thing should be abolished. I repute this moronic waste of my life. I don't care about "kindness" or "respect". Just stay away from me, and the situation will be fine. My conclusion is that this AA project that the "School Board" has burdoned upon us is burining my flesh and causing much stress. This AA thing isn't going to help society at school. It's a totally wrong approach. I am going to hate mondays now.

<br />Ok, what else do I loathe to abolish. Well, there's been yet agian another discrepancy on the bus. These sheela gits(new word for stupid moronic stagnant girls) in the back are making this islamic kid rap and dance. It is disgraceful. I think these girls, and anyone encouraging this behavior should be immediately terminated and disposed of. I repute these unintelligent monkeys, yes I do. Picking on islamic kids, how disgraceful. They say that they are Christian, but they lack even the most simple morals. I couldn't respectivelly stand up for myself because the Islamic kid did it on his own whim (kind of). I know I will get my chance to rant soon. These discrepancies are slowly climbing toward the point of ludacracy, and that's when I strike. I wonder if anyone is listening to me?

<br />At lunch, I want to sit with Amanda because she is alot more knowledgeable than all the people at my table. Unfortunately, I can never find her. I look around and I can't seem to find the familiar blue jersey that she always wears. If I do see her, I am a bit too nervous to sit with her, but alas, this girl with black clothes keeps folowing me calling me her "best friend". I would rather sit with satan then with her anymore. I gotta summon up my courage. I'm sick of the people at my table. They are stagnant of propaganda. I wish I had AIM again. I like to talk to Amanda. I should e-mail her.

<br />I was thinking, I have to go to Harrison High School soon and with the High School comes all that Prom and dating stuff. Being the nervous person I am, I am worrying about the Prom stuff. I would like a date, but who's going to accept my gratuities? I should just stay home. But on the other hand, I DONT want to stay home and let this moment pass me by. It's contradictory and going in tangents in every way. I have 2 people I could possibly ask. I would rather ask one than the other. If I revealed it, then I could see how fast this information spreads. But, on the other hand, I could keep this information for another day. Prom is the word that lingers in my mind.

<br />Well, if you read all that stuff that I just wrote, you must have alot of time. Feel free to email me. I gotta go
