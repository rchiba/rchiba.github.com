Hello, This is Ryo.
<br />Not much news here. Floods, floods, and more floods.
<br />I feel better from the cold now, the only thing that is wrong with me now is my runny nose. That is getting better too. My friend justin is getting a digicam. I cant wait! We can send pics over the internet. YAAy! Well, anyways, there isn't much to talk about in this here indiana, full of corn and beans. Oh yea,! I get to go to Kyles tomoorow. I cant wait. Were gonna fish, ride horses, and tons of stuff. I cant wait. I hope I can get fully healed by tomoro! I just can't wait!
<br />Well, thats all for now, so tata!
<br />;)
