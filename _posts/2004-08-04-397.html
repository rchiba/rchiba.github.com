Hello people of...
<br />
<br />I'm finally back from another one of my escapades into the unknown. This time... California. It's even though it's 11PM and I'm tired, and I smell like an airplane seat, I felt as though I had to update to let everyone know that I'm back.
<br />
<br />Anyways, while in california, I snapped a ton of pictures, went to a redwood forest, went to the "mystery spot", failed to find a wifi hotspot, went to silicon valley, and toured wine country. Alot of stuff. Surprisingly, alot of wine country is just trashy slum. I was kind of amazed by how run down everything was. I thought california would be the golden state, but oh well. Like I said, I'm tired and smell like an airplane seat so I'll just go clean myself up and go to sleep like a normal person now. Bye.
