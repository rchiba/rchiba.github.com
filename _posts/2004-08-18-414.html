This is a last minute post because I should be sleeping right around now. Anyways, There was this kid that was about 10-12 that I saw on my way to Ryan's house. I was just minding my own bussiness, biking my own way. Then he asks me, "Does your bike automatically change gears?". I was like, "No.". This kid goes, "HA HA!". This wasn't just some laugh to joke around with. He was mocking me will full force. I think that he deserves a mention in my blog because he's just a braggart. That complete jerk! HA HA? I just wanted to educate him on manners. That kind of attitude should stay in the slums, or wherever he comes from. Of course, there must be some influence that causes him to be so dysfunctional. Most likely a sibling, but maybe parents. I hate kids like that. Their younger than you, they have no manners, their disrespectful and full of spite, and to top it all off they brag to you. If I could look into the future of this kid, I don't think he's going to get a job, or a girlfriend, or friends for that matter. And why in the heck would I want an automatically shifting bike?
