The evenings are slowly getting darker, and I'm enjoying it.<br /><br />I actually feel like I can go to sleep at 9pm now. The dark blue sky is reassuring. Telling me that tomorrow's Monday won't be as bad as last Monday. Poking through the window panel to inform me that it's time to be in bed. It's time to be asleep. In a few minutes, the purple clouds will look spectacularly dull. So simple, but fantastic all at the same time. They are puffs of sleepy colors.<br /><br />The air is colder and fall is closer. It's around the end of August, and so soon the trees will morph into vessels of playful, brightly-painted leaves. The colors will reach a climax, then quickly die down, falling to the ground to turn gray with the coming winter. Winter shall be the same. Snow, ice. <br /><br />Cold, cold nights with the electric heater sputtering what heat it can muster. The lamps will feel better then. Finally, spring will arrive and with spring will come insects and green life. Spring will be a happy time, a sad time, an angry time. No season is ever one thing for an instant. Then the heat of summer.<br /><br />By the time I'll know it, I will be sitting here, writing the same words, one year later. I might be typing about something that happened at school. Maybe about what I was thinking about. An event, or an idea. Many complaints. And I'll be sitting in front of the same wooden desk, looking at the same worn computer screen, and listening to the same static-plagued radio station. <br /><br />Things will change in time. I don't know how they will, but I can't have my room forever. There's a world out there that I haven't even touched. I'll get there eventually. <br /><br />And when it's all over, I don't know what I'll think to myself. I don't know what I'll think about all of these seasons, all of these words. Rows and rows of people I have and haven't met. Strings of choices, good and bad. Objects that will have survived the wear of time, relics from a past that was my present. And a familiar tune that plays from my stereo as I type this sentence.<br /><br />Sundays are thought provoking.
