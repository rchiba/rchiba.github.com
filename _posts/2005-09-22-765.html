My French teacher instructed me to do something today.<br /><br />She said to do something that brings joy to me and others. The fact that this assignment was given to me last year is both a blessing and a curse. Although I know what kind of mindset to use in this situation, my stories and tales of my life have probably become stale to her. Last year, I gave her a paper that told about me helping my sister with her homework. That is too stale for now, too overused. Like a piece of old bread, it doesn't have the same pinache as it did when it was fresh.<br /><br />It's time to up the ante, or so I try. But, what's there to up the ante about? I have a few things that bring me joy. Of those being writing, memorizing, and drawing. Those three things are what keep me alive after school. I suppose these hobbies can be considered joyful, even though some times drawing, writing, and memorizing can be quite frustrating and nerve racking. I'm still at a learning stage with all three hobbies. The second qualification is what I'm perplexed about. This action must bring joy to others. I don't believe my drawings bring joy to others. At this point, my work is either vomit-inducing or barely tolerable. My memorization binges just annoy my sister. When I memorize, I shout out loud, melding the words to a song playing on the radio, or just stringing the words together into my own song. I get a hoot out of screaming the names of African countries to a rock aria, but the same can't be said for my sister, or anyone else in the house for that matter. But, writing, that has a possibility.<br /><br />I've been writing here for what, two years? And I think that's quite a bit of experience. Of course, I'm going to look back at this post in the future and laugh at my sense of accomplishment. But, you have to admit, my writing has gotten better. It's easy to understand if you jump back into my archives a year or two. My thoughts back then were complex, but my ability to convey them was a shabby work in progress. Now that I think about it, many of my hobbies are shabby works in progress. I just happen to thoroughly enjoy solitary typing, and solitary thinking. The things that only a hermit, or an antisocial, angsty teenager could do. In fact, I pride myself on being a freak.<br /><br />What kind of teenager has an obsessive, compulsive tendency to write crazed essays about one's life? Well, quite a few, apparently, if you look at the popularity of blog hosting sites. But, those kind of websites are garbage, rubbish! I can justly insult them, because in the inside, I know I am at least superior to my peer Xangaistas. But, that's not the point. <br /><br />Amazingly, people do take joy in what I write. I know about six people who read what I write, and actually find humor in what I write. Some of the things I say, they're absurd, for sure, but does one care if the absurd makes them laugh? No. I know, six people isn't a lot. It's not nearly as much as the thousands of people captivated by some authors, but six people is a gargantuan audience for me. The people power me, but in the end, I know I'm just writing for myself. Not really caring for the people who read my garbage, I just do it. The audience is just a side note, a consolation prize for somehow entertaining people. <br /><br />And I have to admit, most of the stuff I write is boring. I complain about homework, whine about time, then complain some more about some obscure pet peeve that I have. I can't justify that. It's disgusting, how my life is only recorded at these simple, insensitive terms. The only thing to look back on my life is complaining and whining. For once, I would like to be unchained from my terrible creative failure.<br /><br />But, what is the point for what I'm writing? I'm writing for myself. I'm writing this to look back at my seemingly purposeless life. I'm writing to keep each day locked up in some way, a format to preserve each tick of the clock. That way, life isn't slipping in between my fingers and falling into an abyss. It's slipping through my hands, but into a chest of records. Life is so intangible, so why not capture it?<br /><br />And so, in the end, I still struggle. I'm lost as to what the point of this post was originally, and I'm still unsure as to if my writing actually gives joy to other people. Although, I believe that if there is any joy to be derived from what gets posted, I think that joy is much more sincere than a one-time act. You're not going to get much out of a one-trick pony, and in the same way, acts are singular, existing only for a set amount of time.<br /><br />The written word is so powerful. It stays where you put it, timeless. <br />I think that's what gives me joy. Giving what is timeless.
