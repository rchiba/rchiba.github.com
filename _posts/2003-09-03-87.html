Sorry for updating once again. Im in a slump. I just had to right a stupid essay last night that took up wayyy too much time. Also, Alexia is acting retarded again. I had many chances to hit her, but I didn't. I really need a stress ball, dont I. I saw some good ones at wal-mart. From now on, I'm gonna try to get myself oout of this writing rut and get myself motivated! Motivation, cooha!!!!
