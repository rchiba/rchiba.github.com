Good thing justin's sores are getting better,
<br />he's gonna need to be healed when he comes back on monday or so. Today, was full of surprises. It all started as a half-day because of parent teacher conferences. Then, in third period(Algebra) the lights went out because the people in home ec. burnt their potatoes, literally. We all went crazy in math, as everyone knows Mr. Rice is. Then when I was going out of the school because the day ended, I saw this little kid (6-7 grader) lying on the ground all crumpled up. His face was red and he looked like he was crying. I guess he got punched. Whoever he is, he'll be forever known in my mind as "the boy who got punched" Whoever that kid was. After all that, I went to Ryan's house. We had a grand old time, but unfortunately, we have another day of school tommorow. Then the weekend, THEN THE (dramatic drumroll and star wars music)JUSTINATOR RETURNS. Ok, thats all I have to say o blog/diary. Good night
<br />;)
