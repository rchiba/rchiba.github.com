Ages, ages ago I thought my life was collapsing.<br /><br />The dismemberment of diving was supposed to bring me joy. Now all I focus is on homework. As I focus on this homework, it always seems like everyone is always faster, smarter, more efficient, just plain better than me at doing everything. I don't raise my hand anymore. Perhaps I have become paranoid of making a fool out of myself. I hate myself, because everyone else is better than me. Every waking moment of my school life has been transformed into a self-hate filled hell. Constantly, I am clumsy. Constantly, I am mentally truant. Constantly, I am a failure. I am obsolete. I hate myself so much. <br /><br />Sometimes it is easier to be angry and frustrated than happy. It's just a matter of convenience. You need strong will power to overcome your own criticism. I'm not strong enough. That's why I'm on a lower tier than you. That is why I am a worthless bag of nothingness and you are.... a worthless bag of something.<br /><br />I make myself sick. I am disgusting. My disgustingly low test grades and my disgustingly slow math skills make me want to implode within myself. I am constantly perpetuating self hate now. I can't help it. It's such a "vicious" cycle. Grr...<br /><br />Anyways, I'm planning to sell batteries at school. I'm not sure if it's legal, but the outrageous priced school batteries justifies my capitalistic crusade. The end justify the means...<br /><br />I'm not so happy right now.
