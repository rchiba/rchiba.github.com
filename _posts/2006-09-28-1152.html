I'm very clumsy with my time. <br /><br />I came home and fell asleep on my couch with the belief that I would wake up a few hours later to have enough time to finish my homework. It's a quarter past 9PM, and I woke up a few minutes ago. I gain some sleep, I lose some sleep. It's such a frustrating balancing act. Now I'm wasting more time by writing this and talking to Ryan (he has a new computer). <br /><br />And every one of my peers is probably experiencing the same stress right now. Can't complain. I guess my situation could be worse. I could have woken up tomorrow morning. That wouldn't be the greatest way to start a morning.<br /><br />*birds chirping, wind rustling*<br /><br /><i>"What a wonderful morni... Oh <b>fuck</b>. I have to do my precalculus, physics, chemistry, english, and programming homework"</i><br /><br />And that's how the it would have happened.
