I talk to myself too much.<br /><br />I noticed this a few hours ago, as I sat on a cold, abandoned seat in front of the school. The air was dry and crisply cold. Snow was falling and collected on my clothes, books, and hat. I was sitting there because my parents hadn't picked me up from Robotics yet. <br /><br />An hour passes. The snow is up to the top of the soles on my shoes. The cold is beginning to really bother me. My face is numb, and my bare khakis are frozen to the seat, making it very difficult to move. The tips of my fingers are as cold as what they are touching, the cold steel bars that make up the seat.<br /><br />Time passes. Thirty more minutes. Then I really start talking to myself. The conversation proceeds in short little quips. Back and forth arguments between myself. These arguments start out sane and bi-lateral, but soon, all the views are one sided. My procrastinating, depressed, angry side triumphs in this time of cold. My shaking intensifies as my body tries to warm itself. <br /><br />Fifteen more minutes pass. By this time, I absolutely hate myself. I'm trying to talk myself into running into the forest near the school and hiding somewhere until I either die or am found. I begin to convince myself that today is "the day" that something different is going to happen, something so inconceivable that no one will expect it of me. I tell myself that the fact that my parents haven't come to get me is a sign that they have "abandoned" me. I sit there in a frozen stupor, not making much sense at all, but all the while believing.<br /><br />My transportation finally arrives.<br /><br />And now I'm sitting at home, still awake at this ungodly hour with a speech to write, a book to read, and a worksheet to complete. Today is tuesday. This means that I have more than half the week to go through. I'm exhausted, and I already know that I'll be even more exhausted tomorrow. For the first time in my life, I am waking up to every "morning" (It feels like night, it's pitch black outside at 5:45am) a bleary mess. For the first time, I am just not functioning correctly. But, not for the first time am I thinking absurd thoughts. I've been doing that for ages.<br /><br />I hate myself. Andrew said that I do this all to get attention. This may be true. If it is, I hate myself. Then this hate perpetuates sympathy for myself. This sympathy perpetuates self-contempt. It's a vicious cycle. <br /><br />I hate myself.
