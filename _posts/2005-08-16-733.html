I lost three pencils, a brand new rubber eraser, a protractor, a bunch of post it notes, and a cell phone today at school. If this keeps up, I'll be bankrupt from school supplies in no time. I'm disgruntled. I always feel like I'm some worthless prick when I lose things because I feel like I've thrown away what was given to me, which is what basically happened today. I can't help but feel negative. No one is in my lunch, the teachers are rude, and I was piled with homework today. The only respite I was given today was these twenty minutes in my room alone. <br /><br />I really can't help but feel negative. Negative and helpless, like a typical angsty teenager. You know? <br /><br />It's just so frustrating when you lose a piece of perfectly functional electronic equipment. I feel like I'm going nuts!<br /><br />Blah, blah, blah... Like you care about my angsty teenger rantings. I mean, I don't really have a reason to be so negative. I'm perfectly fine here, not about to die in some straw hut in Niger. Dying from malaria because I couldn't pay for a two dollar mosquito net. That's how it is. A life is worth two dollars in Niger, and conditions are horrible.<br /><br />Thinking about Africa always makes me a positive person, so I guess we've learned something. When you suicidal angsty teengers start to go nuts, just think of Africa. <br /><br />There's a bright side to every single little thing, no matter how brutal it may be. Lessons can be learned, and technology can be improved. We're all in this together, folks, and we will be until the end.
