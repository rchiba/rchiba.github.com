My demonstration speech is coming up, a much more challenging speech than my previous two. My previous two speeches, my "introduction speech" (which wasn't even a real speech), and my "pet peeve" speeches have been easy because they involve something that can be discussed as long as needed, or as short as needed. I could rant for hours about my life, or just give you the basic facts. On the other hand, my demonstration speech involves something that takes a long time to explain to the layperson. It took me two weeks to get into the spin of Blender and 3d computer graphics. It took me another few weeks to purchase, read, re-read, and notate my Blender Guide book. Now, I'm trying to paraphrase those countless hours into about eight minutes. I have to make it understandable to the layperson as well, not to mention presenting it without technical difficulties (classroom situations usually don't bode well for electronics, school just has a bad aura). So, as I scan the speech that I wrote this weekend, I realize that I'm going to have to read like a maniac to get through it before the 8 minute maximum time limit. <br /><br />But, I'm grateful that I've garnered enough trust from Alex and the crew that I can borrow and use the robotics team laptop for my presentation. However, I must be very careful with it. If something goes wrong, the blame falls on me, and with it goes the trust.<br /><br />In other news, my robotics team animation is taking a *long* time to render. One scene took about 26 hrs. I have 6 scenes. I'm pretty sure it's because I made everything ultra smooth (which means thousands of unneeded vertices), and also have antialiasing set to 16 (which means 16 "passes", or pre-renders before the final rendered frame comes about). I hope to have all the scenes rendered by this tuesday, upon which I can work on audio.<br /><br />In other news, my sister doesn't understand the intricacies of Windows Media Player. How pitiful... Maybe I should help her.
