I'm very scared.<br /><br />After hitting my head against the desk for a little while, I realized that I live an unhappy life. I don't know why. I've got all of these things here to help me. And I'm not being helped. It's sad that all of my friends will be gone in a few years. In two decades I won't be myself. A decade or two after that, my family will be gone. In a few more decades, I'll be gone. It's hard to have hope in these "support" systems, when you know how alone you are in the long run.<br /><br />While not understanding my physics problems, I feel worthless. What people are finishing in minutes I'm taking hours. And I don't even finish the problems. I just sit there and hurt myself. Hopelessly thinking that somehow, if I punish myself enough, the answer will pop out. They never do. I feel more incompetent afterward.<br /><br />And deadlines. Just more deadlines. Missing school because of Robotics is killing me. I'm prepared for neither. I'm just dragging down both. We probably lost the last regional because of me. I can't do anything right. I don't want to deal with anything anymore. But, I don't have the courage to let go. And tasks are compounding. If I don't stay up late tonight, then how will I manage tomorrow? Or the next day? I just get tired, tired, more tired. Lose efficiency. Takes hours to do simple assignments. Have to stay up later. What happens when I don't have done what I need done?<br /><br />If I start falling off now, I may never catch myself.<br /><br />But, what's the point? I suppose I'm falling already.<br /><br />My homework is still on my desk.
