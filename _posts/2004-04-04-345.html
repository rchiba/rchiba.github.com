Sorry for the non-updation.
<br />Average Yo reporting.
<br />This is because this weekend has not been as boring as normal. Also, the NEW version of runescape is out and I have been playing it. Sad isn't it? Well, let me explain my situation.
<br />
<br />On Saturday, I was strapped for time. Here was the situation... My ACT test and Band Concert were on the same day. ACT in the morning, Band after that. If I didn't go to band, my grade would go down. If I didn't go to the ACT testing, 20$ and 2 months worth of studying would go down the drain. As I entered McCutcheon (however you spell it) high school, I noticed alot of other people. I had to leave around noon if I had any chance of making it. I talked to the supervisor and she said that I could not leave early. Anyways, I started to panic. Then I looked at a little yellow book on her desk. It said the test was scheduled to end at 12:30. Now this freaked me out because now I had to make a choice. I am never good at making choices. I either had to choose to take the ACT and not risk my grade, or risk my grade and take the ACT. I picked to take the ACT, and I'm glad I chose that. Well, the test area was shown to me by red placards with little white arrows on them. I just followed the arrows and I soon entered a white cinderblock room. The off-white disturbed me for some reason. This classroom was packed with what I guess was high schoolers. There was a large clock in the middle of the room. Everything seemed symetrical. After all, this is a standardized test. The instructor instructed us with pre-fabricated rules that she read off of a booklet. There were 4-tests and they were pretty easy.
<br />
<br />As I was taking the test, time got to be an issue. I was always looking at my watch, my head was filled with hope (what I thought as false hope at that time). I needed to get to the band concert. Then the test ended. We were dismissed at 12:10 and not a minuite too late. I rushed to the car, leaped in, and my family rushed me down to a high school in the middle of the cornfield. In this high school, my classmates were already tuning. Finally, I got to the school and it was a mad dash for the door. I sped in and asked the staff where the my band class was. When I got into the right room, I was relieved. It was pretty close. If I was a minuite late, I might have not made it onto the stage. And it all ended with a happy ending (our band got a "gold" rating.) So, that was my saturday. Well sunday? I didn't do much. I was planning to make more of my movie, but we need a cameraperson. I'm thinking of inviting Devin again so we can proceed with the movie. 
<br />
<br />I also mowed the lawn. I think it's pretty thereputic. You sit there in the sun, the engine blaring, and just think. I steer the mower sub-conciously. I don't even have to focus, I just steer it into tall grass. Well, that's my weekend.
<br />
<br />Bye;)
