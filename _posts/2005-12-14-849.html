I feel bad right now due to a deep sensation of unproductivity.<br /><br />Inside, I know I've got loads of work to do, mostly studying for finals. Studying for finals entails organizing facts and refrences for all of my essays that I'm going to have to write, brute memorization of a number of vocabulary words in multiple languages, and reading through old tests to refresh old concepts in my mind. Due to this overwhelming workload, I feel like I constantly need to be doing something to justify my existance. <br /><br />Currently, I'm not doing anything of the sort. I'm not jotting down notes for the English essay, I'm not reading through my math notebook, I'm not even memorizing the irregular verbs in French. It feels disheartening, but I just can't get myself to do it all. It's all surreal.<br /><br />On a side note, at QuizBowl today, I realized that I'm very slow compared to my peers. There's this very loud girl that's on my QuizBowl team that bothers me sometimes. I manage to get along with here well though. She's in my French class.<br /><br />Often, in French class, she raises her hand to speak French. I'm not quite sure why one would go about doing this, but in a way, I admire her boldness to stand up against silence and fear. But, one side of me doesn't like her very much. This one side finds her to be a self-centered jerk that likes to impress the teacher for the sake of... well, impressing the teacher.<br /><br />But, that one cruel side of me is being very unfair. She really is a very intelligent, rational person. But, quaint civility seems to elude her. She is not able to control herself when she is thinking impolite thoughts. Sometimes, she exploits opportunities to boast about her superiority. Quite frankly, I feel like an idiot when I talk to her. It hurts me, but I just smile and go along with her jibes and jokes. I tell myself that what other people think of me doesn't matter, but inside, I really know that it does. Because, if it didn't why would I be thinking of it right now?<br /><br />One of my peers told me that I can be self-centered sometimes, often actually. It hurts me terribly to find someone telling me that I'm hurting other people just like other people hurt me. <br /><br />So, at QuizBowl today, for hours, I went along with the silly jokes. I went along with the jovial antics, demonstrating my stupidity. At the time, I thought that was the only way to approach the matter in a socially acceptable manner, but now that I think deeper about it, I believe that I acted out of my place. I should not have gone along with all the jokes. <br /><br />My self-esteem suffers because of it.<br /><br />And so, deeper and deeper the wound gets.
