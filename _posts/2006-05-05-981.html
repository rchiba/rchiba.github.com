It's already Saturday, and it feels like Friday's still hanging onto my leg, not letting me go, with its teeth, like vices, clamping.<br /><br />What am I to do but sleep?<br /><br />After a few hours, I've jumped passed one of my many hurdles. My chemistry poster is finally done. And I'm glad it's over with. I don't want to think about any more biochemistry for the time being.<br /><br />Tomorrow I plan to make a run through the garage sales that are taking place around my house. Exciting deals and whatnot. But one should <b>never buy on the first day</b>, because the sellers can jack up prices and get by with it. In the later stage of these sales are where the deals are at. Although, the enticing items go quickly, there are treasures to be found in the pile of leftover junk.<br /><br />It's funny how I look forward to the weekend for sleep, but there is more work to do on the weekends, and less sleep hours than during a week day. It really is depressing.
