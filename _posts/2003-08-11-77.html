Hello everybody. As you can see, Justin and I have not been updating recently, and I am sorry for that, no cause for alarm. THIS SiTE SHALL PREVAIL!!!! Well, I just came back from my trip to misssouri(dont know how to spell) and I am tired. I travelled for 7 , count that, SEVEN hours to get to missouri. Tommorow is school and I sure am afraid. I guess I cant fight it now that it is so close, but here is one last try, I DONT WANNNAA GOOO TOOO SCHOOOOLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, that was my last stand. I shall come back tommorow and tell you all how it was and what happened. As you know, I am doomed to bad luck so, I'll probably be talking about how many friends I lost, who beat me up, and the misunderstandings and mispronounciations of my teachers. I hope I come back alive, that is all I have to say.
<br />
<br />Anyways, my trip to Missouri was OK. We went to the Lakes of the Ozarks and checked it out. We stayed for about 4 days and we had fun. We went there because of a promotional letter that they sent us. They were trying to sell real estate there and if we were talked to this sales man for 2 hours, we could stay at the hotel for a low price. The letter made the hotel look awesome. It was pretty retro though. Well, anyways, I forget the rest. Im too dumb. I guess thats it for now. Check back with me tommorow, ten-four till then dude. TATA;)
