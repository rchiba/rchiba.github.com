Hello, and welcome to todays edition to Ryo's blog.
<br />ANyways, I couldn't update durring the weekend so here I am. Today was the start of the annual ISTEP Testing. That is the "Indiana State Test for Educational Progress". As I have experienced, East Tipp has not had much educational progress. These tests are really easy, except the new essays that you have to write, those are just a pain in the ass. Anyways, Justin has returned and he is ready to update whenever he feels like it. Back to school... Anyways, today we had a granola bar and orange juice for a snack. I LOVE granola. I don't know why, but I love it. Its crunchy goodness with the wholsome oats and gratifying honey sweet crunch. I just want a granola bar right now. OMG, I just remembered. I am going to go to the bank sometime and exchange my dollars for golden dollars. After all, they are prettier, easier to carry, easier to store, gold, and easier to count than paper money. I hope banks can do that. I really gotta get me some of those golden dollars. Although vending machines dont accept them. The sky has been really blue today. I stare up at the blueness and my heart starts racing. Memories start to creep into my head. I can't seem to make them out though. It's like I had a past life. Or maybe my life belongs in the sky. Maybe I should become a pilot. Then I can get paid to put my head in the clouds. Ahhhh, such a nice day is today....
