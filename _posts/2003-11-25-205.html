Ok, sorry for the no updating. I'm in a writers slump, not really.
<br />It's just that this week is just FULL of homework. Today, I had to make a 6 page constitution for a fictional country. It was supposed to be a group project of 4 people, but only Devin and I worked. Sarah Miller and Samantha didn't do much at all. But I dont blame them, because they are pumped with horomones because their teenagers.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I got home from school and started right on the spot to start to type up/organize the notes that Devin and I took. It took me 1 and 1/2 hours to complete it and I sure am happy that I am done. On the end of the constitution, I wrote my signature EXTRA LARGE. I think I deserve to get most of the credit here. Greedy aren't I. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, tommorow is another hectic day full of homework, and then break. whoopee, not. Just more boring days of monotomy. I wish I had real freinds, that lived next door, and we could do stuff together, and have fun. I don't have any of those friends, I am desparate for friends like that. I miss my buddies in Alabama. Cody, Norman, Andrew. Yeah, those were the days. Hot and lazy, just hanging out or playing walball. ***Sigh*** those were the days. I can just immagine....
<br />
<br />Anyways, enough about my AWESOME past and more about my grim present and future. I don't know what college I am going to. I don't even know any good ones. There are so many. Which path will I chose for my life?
<br />This is a big decision. I don't really want to go to purdue. It's # 20 on the all time best college list. I at least want to go to a college that is on the top 10, or even higher! 
<br />
<br />I did my science test today, I think I did really well, but who knows what Mr. Mann has on my back?
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am out of my slump and I'll have TONS of time to write during break, so tata;)
