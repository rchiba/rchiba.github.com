With little time to spare, I have finally finished the creation of my <a href="http://lifeinthemetaverse.blogspot.com/">new moblog</a> about my new life, in a little universe called Second Life. If you have trouble understanding what Second Life is all about, or what a Metaverse is, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life/">this wiki</a> about Second Life, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse/">this wiki </a>about the Metaverse.<br /><br />It's time to lead a double life, folks. And I'm the one to start the revolution.
