You can't do anything without light. <br /><br />Without light I can't type, I can't read, I can't brush my teeth, I can't get my vitamin D, and I sure can't find my shoes. But, I realized something today that I should have realized ages ago. The less light I have in my room, the cooler it is. The light energy that pulsates off of the light bulb is accompanied by heat energy. Touch a lightbulb, and it's hot. So, now I'm in a very dim room. A small, harsh fluorescent tube the only thing lighting my room.<br /><br />But, light's like a lot of things. Great things, essential things, all come with negative side. <br /><br />Take this afternoon's quizbowl practice for example. My friend informed me of a practice today, so I told my mother, and arrived at the coach's house this afternoon. I was excited. My first social contact in days. The fascinating conversations and social pizazz at the practice <b>seemed like water in a blazing desert.</b> And so, for this reason, as well as the reason to keep my mind from dying, I arrived. <br /><br />The sun splashes the destination with splotches of brightness. The trees above the house make little paths of shadow for me to follow.  And so I do follow these paths. The car behind me fires up and drives away, the hum of the engine slowly becoming quieter and quieter. Until it's just me, the woods, and the house. When I get to the door, I hear other people. Before I even am able to find the doorbell, their voices penetrate the door and filter into my ear. Other people's voices, sound so uplifting. Voices mean people. People mean social interaction. The door is opened, and I come in. Success... for a little bit at least.<br /><br />Not too long after I enter, I find myself cross-legged in a circle of people facing a buzzer console. Wires extend outwardly from the console to our buzzers, the little red buttons waiting for pushing. There's talk, so wonderful. Even if I'm not talking, it doesn't matter because it's still marvelous to be around other sociable people. The air conditioner fills the room with friendly, cool air. Our voices fill the room with friendly, cool conversation.<br /><br />After a few minutes, the game begins and questions are asked. The little red buttons are depressed, discussions are engaged, arguments submerge the rooms occupants' cumulative roars of agreement or disagreement. My little red button just sits there. I might know questions, but I tell myself I don't, and the button never gets pressed. Someone else gets it seconds later, and I sit there hating myself. With each passing question, it gets worse. I hate myself, and the world gets increasingly frustrating. My mind is buzzing, snapping at itself. And I tell myself that there's no point difference between an ignorant person who doesn't know the question, and a person who doesn't buzz. So, it's like I never knew anything, and so I don't know anything. I sit there, a stupid, stupid person. And the world doesn't have time for me. The questions pass me by, don't stop for my problems. And so, in the end, I get no questions. <br /><br /><i>I tell myself it doesn't matter, that I'll get more questions someday. </i><br /><br /><b>But, I know I lie to myself. I delusion myself, distract myself. If only to keep my sanity. But it's a lie. I'll never know anything, and I know it. I'll never answer questions anyday. People will always be better.</b><br /><br /><i>I tell myself it doesn't matter, as long as I do my best.</i><br /><br /><b>But, I'm doing my best and my best simply isn't good enough. My best isn't nearly as good as someone else's so-so. My failure does matter. I'm pulling down the team. My failure is <b>costing</b> others, my failure is <b>degrading</b> the team. My presence has a <b>negative</b> impact.</b><br /><br />Andrew sits there, tired. He's tired, but he answers so many questions than I do. And they say he has a problem with not buzzing. That means that he has the potential to answer even more questions. He sits there dazed. And he answers questions. If he didn't answer any questions, he would have an excuse. But, even in his semi-dormant state, he answers infinitely more questions than I do. <br /><br />I sit there, excited. Agitated. Ready. I sit there ready, but I don't answer any questions. And they say that I don't have any problems. That means that I have no potential to answer any questions. I sit there poised. And I don't answer any questions. I don't have an excuse for not answering questions. My failure is inexcusable. My failure is final.  <br /><br />And for the longest time, I would stare at Andrew, wishing that I could be as sleep deprived as he. For the longest time, I wished many things. <br /><br />But, wishes never come true. <b>Nothing but the truth ever comes true.<br /></b><br />The Truth. The truth that I know, often flaunt, and still hide from. The truth that I accept, but don't accept. The truth that I complain so much about, and hate myself for it. This ethereal "truth" that shows its bothersome, vicious, but reasonable face around every corner of my existence. Between every action, inside every reaction. The truth, my failure, my inability, the futile attempts, but failure presides over all, but still I try, and fail again, only to see the same old face. I constantly question myself, if it's all worth seeing failure all over again, having the truth shoved in my face all over again. Trying to determine if it's worth it <b>to get back up and fail again.</b> <br /><br />Social pizzazz? Offers like that are always too good to be true. <br /><br />I walk out of the practice feeling worthless and horrible.
