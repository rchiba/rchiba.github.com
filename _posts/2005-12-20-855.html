The answer to all of your problems are simple.<br /><br />If gas prices are too high, then don't use as much gas. Complaining about prices is bad enough, but contributing to global pollution, increasing demand, and complaining about prices is as bad as tying a newborn to a rabid cat. With no doubt, this issue bothers me. I don't see how anyone could justifiably banter on about how gas is so expensive. One can take a stroll down any nearby parking area and see idling cars. Cars that have no one in them, but are still combusting their fuel. Heating, working, moving. The gasoline is wasted, but the exhaust is not. It flies up into the air and contributes to the atmospheric soup that we live in. Whether that contribution is negative is debatable, but one can only surmise that it is our society's fault for this increase in price. It's a simple matter of supply and demand, but people, as a whole, don't seem to understand this.<br /><br />Yes, if you plot the sales of SUVs and inefficient, overpriced, "beautiful" cars one can see a noticeable dip. But, the fact that these hunks of oil-consuming metal are still rather present on roads is an indication that there are indeed people who don't get the message. <br /><br />Yes, if you plot the sales of hybrid vehicles, one can see a noticeable increase. But, the fact that there are *still* more SUVs on the road than hybrids is a blatant indication that people don't really care about gas prices.<br /><br />So don't complain about gas prices, just blame yourself.<br /><br />It's all your fault.<br /><br />Go hug a tree or something.
