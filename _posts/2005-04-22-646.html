His eyes are misted. Misted like a waterfall. The blood vessels are dialated. You can see the anger through his eyes. His disappointment, his obvious regret. A regret that he ever met me. <br /><br />Guilt trip time. It's Biology. The last class and we're already at the three different types of evolution. I'm still on my guilt trip. Adam starts to go into extremo explosive "I don't care about its relevancy, but I will justify by asking anyways" mode. I'm still feeling guilty. I can feel the pain and suffering I have caused, yet he laughs. Is he expecting me to feel this way when he laughs? Am I the unfortunate victim of social torture? No. I have brought this upon myself. I look up at the teacher. I don't know where to put my eyes. I'm on the edge.<br /><br />Just finished copying my notes and the teacher quits with two minutes on the clock. I start wondering how to pop my apologies. I concentrate on that little dark speck on my desk, trying to think of a socially acceptable way of saying sorry without falling apart. I can't.<br /><br />Bell rings. Russell comes behind me. I say sorry. He's still not so happy. I'm still tense. I am so right now.<br /><br />I suppose I could have avoided that tension by not talking about Russell so uncarefully. But, it was fate. I hope Russell is ok. Guilt trip.
