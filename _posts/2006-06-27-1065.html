Did many things today, mowed the lawn, worked for six hours, summer school, and it'll be all worth it when I walk out of summer with my volunteer service done, a wad of cash, and two credits. It'll all be worth it...<br /><br />I got a new purse-esque thing (some call it a satchel, others call it a messenger bag, I call it a purse-esque thing) from a certain very generous person (Tiffany). I have begun to mod it up to my tastes, but right now, I'm unsure as to how to decorate it. I do not know how white-out behaves on synthetic fabric, so I'll have to do some testing tomorrow. In the functional sense, the bag works fantastically. Hopefully, the school faculty will let me use it when school starts up again. If they don't, I don't know if my arms will last even more large books with an even larger binder. The bag is so useful, I used it constantly today. All the pockets, zippers, and the wonderful unfrayed strap. It may very well become one of my "everyday-use" (No relation to the Alice Walker story) items. <br /><br />Well, I'm fritzed. Good night.
