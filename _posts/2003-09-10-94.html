Sorry, I couldnt write last night. I couldn't get on the internet much. Anyways, yesterday, that salesman came to our school today. He did the same idiot routine and everyone got all excited, but in the end, parents will end up losing tons of money, kids will become greedy braggarts, and most of all, that salesman will become rich once again. This is for a good cause, but that salesman is too greedy. He isnt doing any of the work and he gets half of the profit! Isn't that stupid!?!?! I think it is. Today I experienced rage alot. Alot more than usual. I kept myself calm though. Calm as can be, but that gets hard when TRENT THAT IDIOT calm, calm, anyways, it gets hard when people like TRENT start pushing you around. I'm gonna bring a book today, or something to do. I should bring earplugs too. All that noise has to result in hearing loss. I gotta go eat breakfast now, so tata;);(
