Some thirty-ish or more people, Iraqis and Americans, died today from people who seem to have a knack of blowing themselves up.<br /><br />And what are you doing about it? Perhaps you're reading a nice book. Maybe you watched television, or maybe you went to a little party with your friends. Maybe you're sitting content at home, in a nice warm chair, enjoying the comforts that this society can provide you.<br /><br />And so, what is the value of human life? Some people see existance on Earth as only part of what is to be experienced. But, for people like me, who believe that if one dies, one dies, and does not exist at all, fails to ever again be in a conscious state, what is the value of life? <br /><br />I value life, human life, very highly. But, I especially value my life over all else. I can't immagine dying, or what happens during death. My memories come from my mind, which handles information that only comes from a conscious state. One cannot experience death truely, unless one dies. But, what happens after that? You can't figure that out until you actually die. <br /><br />So, those people who are dying overseas, what do they experience during and after death? I would imagine there would be little pain involved in an explosive death. In an instant, your brain and body would be chunks flying through the air. The physical destruction of the cells would end life in a flash.<br /><br />Is life that fragile? The life that we all hold dear? Isn't it facinating how something so important and mysterious could be taken away in a flash?<br /><br />And, it's all so odd, that it's a given that more people will die tomorrow. You would think that people would learn to stop killing each other eventually.
