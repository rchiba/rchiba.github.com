Oddly enough, I look back on my walls of little notepad-sized art ditties, and I'm ashamed. Kind of funny really. Once upon a time, I was proud of drawing those. But, now I look at them and shudder, picking out things that went wrong, lines bent the wrong way, line art that went bazooks, eyes that aren't lined up. It's so obvious to me now.<br /><br />And this is a great thing, because it reveals to me that I have advanced, even ever so slightly. Change is beautiful, and I can't believe that I can see my crappy art looking worse every day and this makes me happy. But, it's true, and it's kind of an positive note. The positive note being that I've taken up randomly scribbling in my "Sketch Diary" again. Perhaps I'll start reserving an hour or so every night to sketching, just as in the summer. That would be just wonderful.<br /><br />It's something to look forward to, this quiet time at night, when I can just browse art forums and sketch something from an obscure reference. One could even call it refreshing. And a definite plus to this hour of "relax-time" is that it takes my mind off of my mental insecurities and my chemistry. <br /><br />The only problem about publishing the things I do on paper to the Internet is that my scanner is downstairs in the living room. My parents still don't know that I draw, and I'm a bit fearful of letting them know. I've always been ashamed to let them known I've done something, especially art, because the reaction is usually negative. <br /><br />When my family is away, I can usually sneak down a few sketches and scan them in quick. Editing is another story. Editing takes time, lots of time with my artwork on the screen of the computer. This means that my parents must not be near the computer when I edit. This is difficult, with my scanner and monitor being in such a public place. When editing, I usually lean very close to my computer monitor so any possibly visible portions of my art are obscured by my head. <br /><br />And, now that I look at what I'm doing... Why am I obsessively hiding my artwork from my parents? Who knows. Must be my insecure mind acting up again. And insecurity means weakness.<br /><br />And you know what they say about the weak.<br /><br />"The weak will not survive the purges."<br /><br />And so, perhaps I should stop being paranoid about my parents finding my art. Perhaps I should stop taking extreme measures to monitor who comes into my room. Perhaps I should stop hiding my sketch pad in absurd places, for no reason.<br /><br />Perhaps not?<br /><br />Well, to tell you the truth, my art sucks.<br /><br />I have no idea why I've just wasted my bloody post for such a sucky topic. My "art" isn't even worth mentioning. Bah, to hell with my "art"!<br /><br />In other news, I have chemistry tomorrow. This means I will experience another one of those "not-being-able-to-sleep-because-of-chemistry-homework" nights.<br /><br />Just fantastic.
