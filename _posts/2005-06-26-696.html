And so the story ends for Mr. Smith. Life was good for him, but he never seemed to see it that way. He saw life as a job, a chore, something that just had to be done while he existed. All he is good for is trudging along in his desk job in some cubicle in the middle of a giant mega-corporate leviathan located in a no-name metropolis in a bland, blank country. He can't find his way around the place, so he mostly wanders. When he was young, he was deemed uneducatable by the "system" and his destiny was now concrete. He was sent to one of the government's corporate giants to work a mindless desk job. As he wanders, he considers suicide. Why exist when my purpose is as meaningless as the computer on the desk, he thinks to himself. Can he not see?<br /><br />Back in the day, Mr. Smith contemplated taking his life in a "new direction." Now, his spirits are broken and hopes dashed. New directions were now denied. His individuality was masked by the communal caste system. He was just a worker, a part of something bigger. Living for the greater good. He was living and working for a goal that would not improve his life. But, why? <br /><br />Mr. Smith swallows his pills, and a little extra. The government doctor decided to give him medicine for his aches and pains. Medicine to dull the details in a world where no one cares about one another. So, he inserts pill after pill into his mouth. Suddenly, he realizes that his pill bottle is empty. Perhaps he should go to the communal health department to get more pills. But, on the other hand, he won't need to.<br /><br />As he sits at the foot of his bed, he thinks of his past. The missed opportunities. The drug starts to amass within his blood in dangerous levels. His neural cells begin to wither away and die. Half-delusional, Mr. Smith begins to see what could have been, what should have been. He decided to skip out on crucial events, and now he pays. Pays for the missed opportunities by carrying the powerful, strangling guilt of underachievement. He feels angry, but as he starts to slip into his drug-induced demise, he realizes that his death was in vain. There was supposed to be more to his life. And, as he sits there, the pile of flesh Mr. Smith has become, we wonder. We wonder what Mr. Smith could have been, but fate had it in for Mr. Smith.<br /><br />And, so the story ends for Mr. Smith.
