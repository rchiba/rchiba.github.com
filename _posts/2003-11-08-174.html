I feel as exhausted and exercised as a workhorse.
<br />I feel the need for excitement, for nothing is happening in my life. Oh well, life of the rich and famous is probably worse... Anyways, check out the opinions page if you haven't. I have re-vamped it, and added an article. I saw the last matrix which makes me sooooooo thankful that today is sunny. There is a scene where neo and trinity go over the clouds and you can see the beautiful sky. I've seen that kind of sky many times, for I am a regular airplane traveller. I feel as though I need to fly. FLY!!! But, of course, gravity has the best in all of us. Stupid gravity...
<br />
<br />Anyways, my life is perfect. So perfect. Too perfect. how long can this last? When will the meteor that kills us all come? Maybe it already has, sending shockwaves and tidal waves toward me right this very second. I might die.... tick tick.... nope, still alive. Thats my concept of life. The purpose of life is to die, like Mr. Smith says. I don't want to go to lego league because over the course of 3 weeks, I have found out that those legos are all trivial presuits that I do not want to persue. I just want to type. A more useful skill....

<br />I've heard of the new OS that is scheduled for 2006 called "Longhorn". If microsoft waits that long, then Macintosh might take advantage. Who wants that? Alot of people. But, people exagerate. I think that Macintosh is going to be out of the race for a year or two, for almost 92% of all software is Microsoft only. Mac is only a minority.

<br />Anyways, I want to see a sunset over the clouds. Flying, taking pictures.... Skydiving.... down down down....

<br />My exhausted mind is getting to me, I am writing about trivial things, yet they are needed for the existance of the human race. For this is a society in which humans and technology co-exist and intertwine to make a supportive structure. If one fails the other one collapses. It's like a card pyramid. Take out computers, boom, global economy plumets. Stock market crashes. Take out humans, machines deteriorate. Everything is held on a point of a pin. Electricity is crucial to society, yet why have we survived this long without it? Humans are a bit too dependent on the technology. Too much emphasis, structure basis, incorperated into the technology spiral.

<br />Oh well... I have run out to say. I only got 7 hours of sleep, can you tell?
