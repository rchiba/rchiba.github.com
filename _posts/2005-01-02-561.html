Winter break is ending, and it it still frustrating me. I just want to squeeze my hate for continuous work into a little ball and vaporize it. I just hate to love to hate work. Shoot, I don't even know what I'm talking about...
<br />
<br />Anyways, I'm very tired from living hard. Working hard, playing hard. I want to relax. But, how?
<br />
<br />Moving on, remember the lamp issue from a day or two ago? Now I'm having the same love-hate relationship with the door connecting the garage to the house. It was being slowly degraded until it failed to shut. This disabled the main function of the door, which was to keep hot air in. Therefore, I painted and installed a doorknob. The doorknob fell off once installed. Frustrated, I grabbed a hammer and beat that doorknob down into where it belongs. Now the doorknob works, and hopefully the knob will stay in there. It's quite sad when you realize that you have these kinds of relationship with lamps and doors. How am I going to survive in the competitive dating atmosphere when I'm still working on my love-hate relationship with my door?
<br />
<br />Anyways, I'm still drooling at my site layout. I want to eat it up, but I'm on a diet. Not really, but saying that I am makes me happier about myself. That's all that matters in American society right? The idea is, as long as you make yourself happy, don't worry about others. Yes, society wants you to go buy that overpriced mocha-latte-java-chino from Starbucks while other people in poor countries starve to death, dreaming of beans for their farm. I wonder who hates Starbucks...
<br />
<br />Talking about irrational hate, I hate iPods. I don't know why. Maybe it's because they are rippoffs. Maybe because they are all hype. Maybe because their so friggin' white. I have no idea, I'm just an iPod hater. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, there is something I have a rational hate about, and that's AOL. I hate them. There's too much to explain, just don't trust them little buggers...
<br />
<br />What does schvette mean? Did I make it up?
<br />
<br />Good night. I need rest.
