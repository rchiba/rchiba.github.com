Ha, ha, ha...hello and I bet you are wondering why I'm laughing.  Well, you probably thought this post was from Ryo or Amanda, but it's not. It's from me, Justin.  First I'd like to say that one of ryo's posts was talking about a Justin from school, that is a totally different Justin, not me.  Anyways, the reason I haven't been updating is because there has been anything for me to post.  Nothing has been happening to me.  But now I have something to write about.  That is my new watch that I got today.  It is a Casio G-Shock.  I can insert text into it, it has world time, 4 different alarm settings, a countdown timer,  and stopwatch.  Its really cool.  Oh yeah, it also has a water resistance of 200 meters! and it has this cool thing where if I tilt it at a 40 degree angle or higher, the light automatically turns on for a couple seconds.  Well, I gotta fo eat, bye.
