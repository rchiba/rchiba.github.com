I've felt a response to the many Facebook notes describing my friends' stress, anger, depression, and annoyance.<br /><br />Oddly, it's a positive response.<br /><br />Am I sadistic in being positive when I read about my peer's negativity? Do I take some sick pleasure in reading the details of others' woes?<br /><br />It bothers me that reading over everyone else's misfortune makes me feel better, but I can't seem to change how I react. My sky feels less cloudy when the grass isn't greener on the other side.<br /><br />Don't tell anybody.
