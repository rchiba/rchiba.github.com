My sister plays an oboe.<br /><br />She is very loud and obnoxious. The noise that comes out of that thing is not fit for human ears.<br /><br />But, she's so very lucky, because she has something that I didn't have back when I was her age.<br /><br />She's not bashful about playing. She even has the audacity to be proud of the "music" that comes out of her instrument.<br /><br />And, while listening to her make the whole house vibrate with obnoxious, out of tune notes is frustrating, it made me think.<br /><br />Back in the day, when I first got my clarinet, I was excited. Like any immature little kid, I played a lot just to... well, show off. <br /><br />But, the difference between my sister and I is that I stopped being so enthusiastic about my instrument after a week or two. After a week of playing in band, and listening to other clarinets, I learned that I was a horrible instrumentalist. I learned what a true clarinet was supposed to sound, and I learned that I was not capable of emulating that sound. I also learned that the world is cruel, and that there are lots of people who are better than you and aren't afraid to tell you. So, after a few weeks, I began to only play in my room. Practicing became sporadic, as I became more paranoid about other people hearing the junky noise that spewed out of my room. I knew that I was inferior in my skills, and was terribly afraid to admit it, or even confront the challenge that faced me. I hid from the challenge, avoided it at all costs. I ran away from the challenge of being able to play my clarinet.<br /><br />Even today, I do not know what the names of all the scales are, and have trouble naming the notes by letter. It's a miracle that I've gotten through the public school band program unscathed so far. And I still shy away from practicing, from fear that someone will hear me. I never practice because of it. I'm embarassed to even carry my clarinet case up to my room, because I'm so irrationally afraid that my parents will see the case, and pay special attention to the noise coming from my room. <br /><br />This obscene paranoia about people criticizing me is somewhat covered up by how I act at school, but my habits say a lot about who I reall am. <br /><br />I do not scan pictures into my computer and edit them unless my whole family is out of the house.<br /><br />My family does not know of this website. I hide it from them, deleting all traces of it on my computer every week so my parents will not find it.<br /><br />My sketchpad is hidden under a secret nook in my wall, behind my desk.<br /><br />I find ways to steal pencils from my sister so my parents won't think I'm a wasteful person when I lose a pencil.<br /><br />If I mess up the home network because I pressed a wrong button, I blame it on my ISP.<br /><br />I prop up a small piece of cardboard onto my door to monitor any traffic that enters my room.<br /><br />And my life somehow continues to be lived like this. It's one mindless situation, trick, and lie after another.<br /><br />And the whole situation never fails to confuse me further. My sister has no problem sitting in front of everyone in the living room and blowing out horrid noise that fills a five meter radius with bad vibes. And for some reason, I don't like my sister for this.<br /><br />She has courage to face social antagonism. I do not have this courage. <br /><br />I am a coward. A paranoid one at that.
