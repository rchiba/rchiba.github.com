I'm exhausted.<br /><br />I just finished a work week, a 3 page biology packet, and an 800 word essay about how the "Odyssey" is related to "Star Wars: Episode IV, A New Hope". I feel like sleeping and not writing. Partially because all of this brain work has left me empty headed and left with nothing to say. I'll think I'll doze off now and wake up in the morning to start a new day. <br /><br />Good night.
