I didn't know that these gmail swaps actually paid off! I traded a gmail invite with this Jeremy guy and I got this awesome compact flash memory card, for real! The unfortunate thing is that all of my electronics use secure digital. Oh well, I can use it in the future! Anyways, I am really glad, so a kudos goes to Jeremy! That's the happy part of my day.

<br />The angery part of my day is that I can never be able to answer any questions in quizbowl. I'm infuriated by my incompetence in the area of literature and russia. I'm an idiot, and I know it. Anyways, this quiz bowl thing is getting to me, but I really want to be on the team, because it seems to be LOTS of fun because the coaches (Schnieder, Mike) are really hilarious. I really want to be on the team.

<br />Anyways, I am still having troubles opening my locker because it is just so stubborn. I can consistently get it open, but it just takes LOTS of force to do it. The locker handle routinely cuts into my flesh so that the tenderest layer of skin is exposed. My hands are chafed and cut by my locker, but this torture must be endured to keep going to school.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I always seem to have someone interesting sit behind me in the bus, and they talk about very socialistic things. Cruel things. Especially the girls. They seem to have their own little society that involves intense social competition, insults, and deep thoughts about people. It's really very intreguing.
<br />
<br />Speaking of girls, I was talking to Babbi on the bus this morning and we debated about things until I won. It's not fun when you always win debates. I need someone who's hard headed and has some reasons behind their logic. People these days have NO reason behind their logic. Everything happens a set way just because "god" or a teacher has said so. It makes me angry that reason is not involved in their beliefs. Anger...

<br />Well, that's all for today. Zut Alore!
