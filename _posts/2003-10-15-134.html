I'm back everyone.  I'm doing a lot better today.  The only problem is that I can't lay flat when I go to sleep.  Now I have an AWFUL cramp in my neck!  Anyway, I'm really bored.  There's nothing to do here.  I HATE IT!!!.  This may sound weird but I kinda wanna go to school.  The reason being is because my friends are all there.  I miss them.  The only person I've been able to talk to during my absence is Ryo because we can talk on MSN Messenger.  I'm all out of things to talk about so see ya!!!
