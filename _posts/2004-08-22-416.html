This weekend I went to the Indianapolis Zoo. I've got some pictures for you. I have to get cracking because time is running short and tomorow is school. Anyways, today I worked outside which was a big change, then I went to the gym. I really hate it. I was playing a broken record in my head that said, "get me out of this place" over and over again. But then again, deep inside, I kind of see the advantages of it. I really want to go, but really despise going. It's a complicated emotion. I figured out the intricacies of my pda's wi-fi capacities. I used to have to use a 3rd party software to find wifi and it never worked. Anyways, the next task is to try to sell my 6 extra gmail invitations for some junk, or maybe a cute little monitor pet. Also, I have to add a picture to my profile. I'll probably take a picture of my current monitor pet, a clay scientist owl. Anyways, right now I am transfering classical music and opera to my  pocket pc. I love my 1GB card. In other news, I better be in bed right now.
