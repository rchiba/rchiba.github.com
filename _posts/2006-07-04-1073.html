As many may already know, tomorrow is summer school. I'm glad I'll have something to do in the mornings. It's always frustrating to wake up and not do anything until afternoon. <br /><br />I derive so much enjoyment from berating my sister on her poor web design abilities. Her color coordination is horrible (parchment paperish yellow mixed with forest green, a splash of bright pink with black borders), she doesn't know how to direct the viewer's attention (distracting decorations plague her new template), and she fails to understand that gradients are for noobs. The last gripe is one of my pet peeves. I absolutely detest gradients. It's something the majority of the world fails to use responsibly. The novelty of these idiotic fills wore off over six years ago.<br /><br />I shouldn't make fun of her as much as I do though. My attempts at making websites were much worse. Faded sepia background images with magenta and cyan title text, sewage-green mixed with a little pastel pink. My finished templates were surely vomit inducing, and at times possibly fatal.<br /><br />In other news, a North Korean state-run news source stated that if North Korea is threatened by the US any longer, they will wage "a relentless annihilating strike and a nuclear war with a mighty nuclear deterrent." The US has dismissed such threats as "hypothetical".<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/07/04/korea.missile/index.html" title="OMG, Kimmy!" target="_blank">[LINK]</a><br /><br />This is funny. I guess even the US government is laughing at these stupid threats. An "annihilating strike"? Hilarious!<br /><br />Today, I had to close the pool and reopen it twice due to stormy weather. As I sat in my pool chair waiting for people to come to the pool (three people came for the two hours I sat there), I stared at the sun. The clouds obscured the glowing orb just enough that I could admire its shape without (hopefully) any lasting damage. The sun is perfect. I can now understand why cultures before civilization worshipped and celebrated the sun. Even now, the world goes to church on each "Sun Day". It's so large the sky has a noticeable dent, it's so powerful it hurts the eyes, the sun. It powers us, its energy is the only reason you are sitting here and reading this pathetic post, and I am sitting here writing this pathetic post. <br /><br />A large asteroid came very close to Earth on Monday,  "<i>slightly farther away than the moon.</i>" <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060703.waster0703/BNStory/Science/home" title="asteroid, OMG" target="_blank">[LINK]</a> One must question the importance of everything from this information. "everything" is so broad, but when dealing with a possible asteroid-Earth collision, everything is at risk of being destroyed. Everything as in everything. Technology, society, culture, civilization, the human race, the planet. Everything. Thinking about an asteroid collision makes celebrity news seem so absurd. So-and-so married so-and-so, etc, etc. And giant rocks are flying through space narrowly missing our planet, narrowly missing destroying everything. When the celebrity news gets more attention than news of this asteroid, and I'm sure it does, then it becomes so glaringly obvious that the world is looking and walking the wrong way. Having everything destroyed is such a simple thing, but it's so hard to conceive in the mind. It's sort of like dying. All of our memories are of when we are alive, so none of us know what it's really like to be dead. <br /><br />I'm still afraid of dying.
