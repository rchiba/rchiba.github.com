I spent like an hour making a post that actually mattered and firefox had an error which deleted my whole post.<br /><br />This is the time when you want to kick the computer into a pond and watch it slowly die in it's own bodily fluids. This is the time when you want to rip the keys off of the keyboard. I hate computers. I HATE EVERYTHINGISWPIgp;aweuio;j......<br /><br /><br />Ok, calm down. What I do hate is the IOGSDH: BVfbfdbdrg....<br /><br /><br />Maybe I should go to sleep before I explode from rage and anger. <br /><br />I suppose I can justify my experience by saying that there was a lesson learned from all of this, but unfortunately there isn't a lesson. I hate myself.
