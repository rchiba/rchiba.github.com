It's amusing how life repeats itself over and over for about give or take seventy years, then you die.<br /><br />Actually it's not all that amusing, now that I think about it.<br /><br />I'm going to spend my evening downloading StarFox music at 5kbps! Yes, that is five kilobytes per second. Yes, that means it will take hours. Yes, I am a user of bittorrent.<br /><br />I was at the supermarket. At the supermarket, I wasn't in such a happy/sappy mood since I'm always paranoid that I'll see someone I know working there. Whenever I see someone else who's my age working, I always feel envious and ashamed. Ashamed that they work and slave away, while I buy my lime jello and chick peas. <br /><br />I entered the supermarket. The aisles were reflective. Squeaky clean! I suppose some teenage slave had to work very hard to scrub the tile and polish them. Guilt starts seeping up my throat, even though things have trouble seeping up, even if you're in space. I look around, and pick up a stray orange resting on the side of the bread counter. I hold it in my hand, as I gaze at it forlornly. Hm... Perhaps this is a misunderstood orange who has been shunned by his community because of obvious social objections (this orange was slightly yellowish.) Perhaps this orange has been living here on the bread counter, in exile, for quite a while. Perhaps this orange was about to kill himself (If an orange had a sex, I assume it would be male, since it's they're always unpredictably sour or sweet.) Perhaps this orange wanted to be part of a community that never accepted him for who he was. So, this orange was sitting there, next to baked goods for all this time. Foreign, oddball rejects these baked goods were to this orange. Poor orange.<br /><br />Feeling pity for this precious orange, I quickly put it back into the orange bin. Hopefully this once rejected orange will find a new life with his second chance. Good luck Mr. Orange.<br /><br />Yes, it is quite odd, but I often personify fruits when in supermarket situations. Traversing this large food warehouse is always arduous, so I have to find some way of amusing myself. Please try to understand...<br /><br />So I wander to the juice. It's pretty hard to personify a liquid (It's been done before in my head, a la flubber) so I quickly look around to find any other noteworthy things about the juice receptacle location. I find that there is about two small refrigeration units full of juice, and two aisles dedicated to soda. I thought that was pretty noteworthy, so I started thinking to myself...<br /><br />"What's the point of banning vending machines at school when parents just buy soda from the supermarket and bring it home?"<br /><br />"Isn't it time the government did something productive? Attack the problem at the source!", thinks I.<br /><br />Pondering my newfound ideas about supermarket soda reform, I waddled myself over to the iced and frozen goods aisle. I find there a scruffy looking biker man wearing a black leather Harley-Davidson outfit and his severely obese girlfriend. She wears a skimpy pink shirt. I silently cringe in disgust. They bicker over their ice cream.<br /><br />"Double fudge today, come on!"<br /><br />"But we get double fudge every day! How about Mega Oreo Vanilla?"<br /><br />"No! Double fudge today!"<br /><br />I find the conversation slightly amusing, so I move in. I stealthily sneak up, pretending to browse through the sorbet. They soon leave after getting both "Double Fudge" and "Mega Oreo Vanilla" to my dismay. Both the fact that they got both of the flavors, and the fact that they left (so I couldn't be entertained) was what dismayed me.<br /><br />Ah, I approach the designated payment location. My mother has all of her supplies, and I have my fair share of supermarket musings. I look up. Teenagers. I employ my teenager strategy. No eyecontact.<br /><br />I browse through the tabloids on the bright yellow basket near the gum. I keep telling myself to make no eye contact. It's difficult. I keep trying to divert my attention with the silly tabloids. I'm itching to just take a quick glance and see who these teenagers are. I forcefully lock my neck in place to prevent myself from doing this. Finally, human nature kicks in and I look up. <br /><br />I sigh in relief. I do not know these teenagers, but I do notice how they work. They work as if they have no life. As if at any moment at all they could say, "It's not my job" and shrug. I cringe in disgust yet again at their poor work ethic. Disgusting. The teenage girl tosses the eggs into the shopping cart as if she were tossing a few cents to a homeless person. We leave promptly.<br /><br />Truely, you can find adventures in the supermarket.
