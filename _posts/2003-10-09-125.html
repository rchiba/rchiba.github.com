Hi. I'm Lisa, Ryo's sister, and i will tipe because Ryo is doing his homework. Today I did my spelling test and it was soooooo easy! I also did a program at school and two music rehersals! I was standing up there for about 40 minutes.  So 40 + 40 =80 min. It was very boring. We got to sit on hay bails which made my butt itch. Well, thats my usual day so bye!
