Yesterday I was conflicting over if I should, or even could go to the block party next door. My mom said I have to go because there isn't any food at my house and the block party was going to be my only source of food. I thought for about an hour then I remembered. I danced in front of 300 people in a cow suit. Block Party? Piece of cake. I went and ate and even though everyone was either in their 30s or in their 6's, I survived. I found some nice site with a ton of theme song mp3s. 
<br />
<br />Today I am conflicting over weather I should download some mp3s. It's illegal, so I probably won't, but it's like a million dollars shoved in your face. Take it and take a risk, or leave it and be safe. It's very hard... to resist... I must stay away! Happy 4th of July. Remember that sparklers burn at 1800 degrees farenhiet. That's enough to melt iron. Those sparklers are the second most occurring fourth of july injury. I have no idea what the first most occuring injury is. Idiot indiana laws. They pass incredibly stpuid laws. When you buy illegal fire works here, you have to do some paperwork that says that you have to take the fireworks out of the state to fire them. And on top of that, you have to say that you will fire them at a certified pyrotechnics show. Idiot law. Who's going to do that. If they wanted to ban those fireworks, just make it illegal to SELL them, not illegal to fire them. Yea, a ton of people are going to go out of state to fire their fireworks. Not...
