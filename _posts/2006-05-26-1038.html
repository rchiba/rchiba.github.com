It's amazing what a window in time will do.<br /><br />I've read books, and I've denounced many of them. I've denounced them as academic sophistication gone completely overboard, analysing elements that weren't supposed to be tampered with, picking apart plots that held no significant value, trying to read "between the lines" where nothing but white space exists. I've hated, squandered my anger on literature. <br /><br />During the school year, reading was a chore to be squeezed in between chemistry and sleep. Madly rushing to cram raw text data into my mind before another school day began.<br /><br />I started to read my summer reading book nonsense this morning. Figuring that I might as well do sometime remotely useful. <br /><br />The book strikes me as being different. Easily read, and emotionally engaging. It's not dry, and it doesn't require a dictionary.<br /><br />And I ask myself if it's really the book, or if it's just because I have time to relax and really read, sip the text at my own leisure, and not gulp it down in a frenzied panic.<br /><br />I ask myself this because I read this book all day, skipping meals, skipping sleep, to read this book, of my own accord. This is something that is rarely done.
