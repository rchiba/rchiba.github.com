Insulting someone by calling them "gay" must be the most politically incorrect saying that I've encountered to this day. Not just politically incorrect, but just plain wrong. <br /><br />Def of Gay:adj 1: bright and pleasant; promoting a feeling of cheer; "a cheery hello"; "a gay sunny room"; "a sunny smile" [syn: cheery, sunny]<br /><br />Well, and then the homosexual community started using the word to refer to themselves. This led to the use of "gay" as "homosexual."<br /><br />For some odd reason, people seem to hate homosexual people. And it's hilarious how they try to explain it. They say, "It's just plain wrong." What? Wrong? Wrong compared to what? Wrong compared to Mr. Thompson suing Rockstar and its associates? Wrong compared to 14 year olds having pregnancies? Wrong compared to my little toe? Wrong compared to 25,000 people dieing every day from malnutrition? If people continue to explain themselves so vaguely and so undefinitively, I believe that proper debates among people will be reduced to mere bickering. Not that they weren't bickering in the first place.<br /><br />If you are uncomfortable when near a homosexual, fine. Being uncomfortable near, or even being religiously against someone doesn't mean you go out brandishing campaign posters and picket signs. People have been homosexual for centuries now. Deal with it. If you want to "cure" something, go cure AIDS, or cancer. Homosexuality doesn't kill anyone. They are not a threat to you. If something as unimportant homosexuality and its "righteousness" can attract national debate and discussion, then I'm sure AID packages to Africa could be discussed every day. And don't get me started on Bosnia. Bosnians aren't even "black" and Americans ignore them. Everyone ignores the people who really need the attention. They need the help that we refuse to deal. But, alas. Even after the one.org campaign and the Live8 concerts, only 250,000 Americans signed the petition asking for more aid to poverty stricken nations. That's a slap in the face to both the dying nations and the reputation of this "superpower" that we all live in. What is this "superpower" doing? What's so "super" about a nation that rants on and on about the "wrongness" of homosexuality while people are starving overseas?<br /><br />There are alot of things "that are just plain wrong" in this country. Being homosexual isn't one of them.
