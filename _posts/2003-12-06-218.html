Hey blog-thing....
<br />My head seems to be pounding a lot lately, but I don't really mind it anymore. I guess, this sickness gives me comfort, for it brings the pain I am feeling inside out a bit. But, I must remind myself I am not aloud to feel such emotions such as anger, I don't want it controlling me. And that is the strange thing, I feel such anger that it tries to consume me. Just like the other day when Krista was saying she was going to die, I could barely contain myself from screaming or lashing out. I settled this internal dispute in art class, where I just devoted myself towards the sculpture, pushing away these stupid feelings. Maybe that is why human beings were created, so they could feel pain, regret, and misery like no other creature, to my knowledge, can do. Human beings have done so many things wrong, and yet it is only half of the argument-I guess there is always a bright side, however small or hard to find it may be. It is just, lately, I have been dwelling on so many things, so to keep myself from harm, I just ink it all in. I guess it is now a new obsession or something. Every since Thursday I have been inking my skin every night, adding new things every time and redoing old things. I don't think anyone will or ever will understand. It is a new outlet, not as good as letting the mental pain become physical, but it makes me feel better. By starting with my feet, I have to twist my legs into painful positions and the muscle cramp my ever persistable problem knees burn, and my neck has to dip to look, to strain. While some positions are admittedly easier than others, I can't help but feel better after I've done it, no matter how comfortable or painful the position is. I know this is a bad way to do things, to push away the feelings, but drawing or writing doesn't help any more, at least, not like it used to. I guess, marks make me feel good... I can't tell. I just feel so dead inside somedays. I know... I know Tuesday will be the deadest day of all. I have a meeting with Don, and I hate him so much. I know it is bad to complain and to hate, but Don is the only person I can find to hate, and for a really good reason too. A reason I can't tell, not even to you blog-thing. For if it were to get out, my life would dive into complete misery. People would give me those sympathetic looks, laugh behind my back, and just stare. They'd pry, they'd jeer, and this dead feeling inside would consume me. I can't let that happen, and I can't let such emotions control me. I am not aloud to cry, and yet... Sometimes it is hard not to. I just have to say, I am not aloud to cry, and I wont or I will and it wont be as much. For at school, you get in trouble for feeling if you aren't popular, get laughed at for crying, and just get in a pit of misery if you even try to shine. So, every morning I must greet the day with a smile, for if I don't? I get yelled at my peers. I must then hold that smile, that stupid mask of strong throughout the day until I collapse into my bed and go into my 'place'. I can be whoever I want, whenever I am alone.
