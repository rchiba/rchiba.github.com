I was supposed to read a book for English today, but didn't.<br /><br />My teacher gives us assignments that we aren't checked on, but when the test comes along, she'll find out who did them and who didn't. That's why I'm fearful for this Wednesday, when I'll have to take the test on this book. But, I shouldn't be complaining. It was my decision to not read the book. I'm hoping that the test will be easy enough to ace with little reading. I've managed situations like this, I'll do it again. <br /><br />Choices. Making lots of them.<br /><br />On my desk are three colors of adhesive-edged notes. Pink, purple, and yellow. Yet, my desk is covered in yellow. I make the choice to go with yellow. And I don't know why I do this. In my life, colors have never really mattered. Besides the "red=stop, green=go" association, colors have played a very unimportant role. I'm not a particularly vain person either. Then, why yellow? Sometimes, I stare at my three piles of differently colored notes and wonder, wonder why I make these seemingly mundane choices. These choices stand out in my life, the ones I make subconsciously. What jacket I decide to wear every morning, which pencil I'll use on a particular test, which type of bagel to get in the afternoon, all questions that I answer without reason or thinking.<br /><br />I'm sure the ultimate, universal logic to it all will eventually come to me in one form or another.<br /><br />Where there's a will, there's a way. But, where there's a yellow sticky note, there's unremarkable quandary.
