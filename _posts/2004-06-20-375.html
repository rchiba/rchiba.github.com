Went to Chicago today. It was strenuous (not really) and took all day. As usual, my sister got nauseated and I got bored. My dad's van smells odd, so I decided to buy this thingie which is an air-freshener that's on a spring. It's got eyes. We went to a bunch of japanese stores and went to Galyan's, which is a sporting goods store. My dad tried on some Aero 9 rollerblades and now he's probably going to buy them on the internet. Summer Gym is tomorow and I am going to have to take Jon with me to Harrisson for the rest of the summer, but I don't mind. I'm learning JavaScript with various primers on htmlgoodies.com. I have to continue to learn SOMETHING over the summer. It might as well be JavaScript. At Chicago, I also got some nice digital images of planes landing at O'Hare airport. I just LOVE the camera!

<br />Well, I gotta go learn some JavaScript before I have to go to sleep!
<br />Nighty Night!
