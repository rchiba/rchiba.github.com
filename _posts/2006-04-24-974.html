I was having a hard time concentrating in French class today.<br /><br />The teacher gave "speaking tickets" to all of the volunteers who gave the answers to her questions (in French, of course). She didn't reveal that she would be until after everyone had finished answering her questions. Speaking tickets are little squares of paper that are redeemable for points. One must collect as much as the "average" person in the class to receive all of the points. Any extra can be taken for extra credit. Of course, being the idiot that I am, I didn't volunteer. When she revealed her intentions to give the volunteers tickets, my heart sank. For the next twenty minutes, I had to talk to myself to keep myself from mentally snapping and having an emotional breakdown. <br /><br /><i>"How could you be so stupid?"<br />"Those were free points!" <br />"Your grade will suffer for your failure."<br />"Might as well give up, you have no hope."<br />"You deserve to be punished for not volunteering"<br />"Why don't you ever learn!? This is what always happens."<br />"Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid"<br />"There's antifreeze in your room for a reason."</i><br /><br />So these were the thoughts that were running through my head. I couldn't help but feel helpless, but the fact that I wasn't helpless, that <i>I</i> was the cause of my own suffering reinforced my thoughts that I was an incompetent, selfish fool. <b>Feeling bad would make me feel worse. Feeling worse made me hate myself. Hating myself would make me feel bad. </b><br /><br />The bell rings, and another horrible French class period ends. I slump out trying to collect myself so my true emotions don't show. Someone taps me on the back, I turn around, and I mumble something to him. He feels brushed off, so he leaves. Or, I leave him. Too unstable to feel guilty, I, a disgruntled student about to collapse from exhaustion, enter the math room.<br /><br />Life gets progressively better after this. I sleep through half of the period in math class, and my mood jumps a bit higher. Someone in band class makes me smile. I slowly gain confidence in speech, as I attempt to convince my partner that we have a strong argument in the upcoming debate. I learn to control my incessant urge to decapitate my peers in health class. I explore during lunch. I relax during english. I have fun making a fool out of myself in chemistry. And the bus ride home has me feeling as positive as I was before French class. <br /><br />But, hell will restart tomorrow. And the deplorable cycle will start again, as it manifests itself in my soul once more.<br /><br />Every day, I look out of the many windows of the school, staring at the beautiful blue sky and the vibrant greens of the grass blades that wave in the wind like little sails. But, I realize that those pretty things may as well not exist. Looking through those windows is much like looking into a television. I will never escape the establishment that isolates me from the outside. And as I forlornly tap my finger on the thick windowpane in an empty hallway during my lunch period, I realize that this may very well be the closest I'll ever get to experiencing freedom. Even if I manage to escape those that encase me in concrete walls and beige paint, I will enclose myself.<br /><br />Life taunts me with windows that I'll never break through. <br /><br /><br /><br />
