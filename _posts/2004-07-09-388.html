Once upon a time there was a president. This president went to war and killed many people. Mr. President was portrayed as a criminal of sorts. In this land, far, far, away, there was an election. The two nominees were both bad. Then it became a twice upon a time story.

<br />Anyways, I hate the body mass index because it is so inaccurate. They teach you how to use it and tell you that it is such a good indicator, etc. My dad goes to the gym 3 times a week. Acording to Mr. BMI, he's obese. Jees...
