When I tell people that I strongly dislike video games, they get violent. Go figure...<br /><br />Anyways, I woke up and felt like a million bucks this morning, but upon reaching English, my delicate self-esteem level came crashing down. My English papers are never that great, but it made me feel terrible when I found out everyone else's success. The whole incident made me like a faceless rice cake. Go figure... again...<br /><br />And, don't ask me what it feels like to be a faceless rice cake. That is the question that only 1337 p30plz kan k/\/0w.<br /><br />By the way, the Harrison barn (a barn that my school uses as a billboard) was burnt down. Supposedly, this heart-wrenching incident was caused by Jefferson High School. Hey, that's just a rumor.<br /><br />It's so intriguing how people go to great lengths to convert Atheists back to religious nuts. My friends Kaiser Andrew and Zach were having a bit of a chat at lunch with me today. We went on to talk about religion and it seems previously rational people turn into some bezerk machine of conversion. It's like talking to insurance salesmen. Oh well, if divine forces advocate the shameless peddling of religion, I suppose it can't be all that bad. Right folks?<br /><br />I still hate OLC by the way. I hate it. Forever.
