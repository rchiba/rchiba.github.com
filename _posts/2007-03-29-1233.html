It's something that has to be accepted.<br /><br />My quality of life right now is the highest it's going to be in the next decade or so. Everything's downhill. It has to be. Independence? Pssh, what an abstract word. If that's all there is to gain, there will be many dark moments ahead.<br /><br />Really, it's absurd to think that my life now is stressful. In a year or two, I'll be yearning for today. In four years, I'll be yearning for what life's like in two years. My life is a breeze. I'll just keep telling myself that and I'll believe it, right? Just lie to myself. What a novel idea.<br /><br />No more mental cursing at myself because it's Thursday night and homework is due on Monday morning, and no more of this being stressed out over nothing. It's crazy. Why do I get so wound up? Holiday? What's that?<br /><br />Just accept it, stupid, it's going to happen no matter what. The anxiety is purposeless. Listen to reason, for once in your life.<br /><br />My future is bright? Bright? Oh really? So bright it sears my eyes into painful, white spheres of jelly. It can't get any better than that, nope.
