Oh yes, <br /><br />I forgot one thing. I put up my "Great Map of Guests" that is a bit like a guestbook except you can mark where you are. Please post. I like it when people talk about me. I know, I'm so vain.<br /><br />Oh yes, <br /><br />Another thing, I just noticed that the bottom right hand corner of my shading picture is blue. I feel like an idiot. Ok, I'll blame it on the paint tool. EVIL PAINT TOOL!
