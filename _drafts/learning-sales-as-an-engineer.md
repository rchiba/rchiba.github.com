As someone who identifies as an engineer in the startup world, here are some things I've learned about sales over the past 2 years. 

## Identify and Discard Existing Sales Falsehoods

I've found that engineers, including myself, tend to have a massively distorted perspective of sales. Everything about sales, from what it is, who is good at it, the skills required, the morality of it, how it should be rewarded, I mean EVERYTHING. This is directly correlated to the engineer's level of sales involvement, which in most organizations is sadly very little. So the first step in becoming competent at sales as an engineer is identifying and shedding all of these falsehoods.

A couple examples:
* Sales requires aggression, pressure, and manipulation
* Sales is for extroverts and loud people
* Sales is a lesser form of work because it's not "technical"

Like dispelling any strange generalization about a group of humans, the best way I've found to remedy the situation is to make friends with more salespeople. You'll discover that the best in the business often fall far outside the box that you drew for yourself. And you'll find new patterns to help you draw a new box.

## Listen

Most people think that sales is that it's about speaking, not listening. I mean, just visualize a person "selling" you. What do you picture?

The problem is that it's just straight up wrong. Sales is about listening to the buyer and understanding them. It's about efficiently finding their pain, linking that to a solution, and negotiating a mutually beneficial agreement. All of that rests on a foundation of understanding. 

So before ever diving into a pitch, dive into all of the questions you need to ask in order to understand the buyer's pain (unless of course you're forced to give a pitch in an elevator).

## Level Up Your Rejection Stamina

A couple facts:
1. Rejection is painful, especially painful for anyone unused to it. 
2. Engineering is a line of work that simply can't compare to sales in terms of frequency of rejection. Just compare the average number of rejected pull requests for an engineer to the volume of rejections faced by an average salesperson. 

So it's understandable that an engineer being forced into a sales role will be less resilient in this regard.

As an engineer, you've got to recognize this weakness and work on overcoming it. Spend time before every call meditating on the worst case scenario, which in most cases is just that the lead goes on their merry way without buying your thing. Which is not a big deal. 

## Sales Anti-Pattern: Being too Friendly

The easiest way to avoid rejection is to be friendly and accomodating. The problem is that this often can severely hinder communication and ultimately work against the best interests of both the seller and the buyer. Here are a couple examples

* You ask a question to learn about the buyer's pain, and they give you a generic response. You don't want to be rude and dig deeper, so you move on, only to later showcase parts of the product that would be completely irrelevant to them.
* Your product is outside the buyer's budget, but you don't ask about it because that would be rude. So you waste time on both sides pitching a product they will never buy.
* You end the call having thanked the buyer for their time, "glad that you had a chance to chat", without setting clear next steps, resulting in a lost opportunity.

So pay attention to when you are being too friendly. Just remember, both you and the buyer benefit from a successful sale, so don't let friendship (or more accurately, avoidance of rejection) get in the way of that.

## Benefits Before Features

Engineers often have a huge blind spot in their vision when it comes to the benefits the product has for the customer. Being so close to the product constantly, working on edge cases and polish, it's easy to get caught up in how it works rather than why it was built.

So instinctively, a product demo quickly becomes a product walkthrough. 

The problem is that buyer's only care about how what was built benefits them. So it's important to take a step back and before every feature you describe, to ask questions that allow you to tie the feature into a benefit. 


## Believe in What You Sell

I've saved the most obvious advice for last, but there's a twist.

Of course, it's much easier to sell something you truly believe in. But one superpower that engineers have is that if they don't believe in what they're selling, they can solve the problem by building.
