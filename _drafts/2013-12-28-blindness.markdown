We all have our moments of weakness, just as well that we are still capable of weeping, tears are often our salvation, there are times when we would die if we did not weep

This quote resonated with my own personal beliefs that sadness is an essential part of the human experience, and avoiding it or disparaging it only serves to distance yourself from how we were supposed to experience the world.

Perhaps only in a world of the blind will things be what they truly are.

An interesting thought that branched into a couple of conclusions in my mind
* Saramago thinks that this dystopian world of brutish animalistic existence is what the world truly is.
* If we are blind to the existence of others and act selfishly, then this is who we truly are.
* If we are blind and dependent on others, then this is who we truly are.
* If we are blind and can still provide for others, then this is who we truly are.
* If we were blind, we would be a mixture of all of these things, and this is who we truly are. 
* What defines our own existence is our behavior among others and our relationships. 
* I agree, Saramago!

there is nothing in this world that belongs to us in an absolute sense

Ownership is something we take for granted, but it is an artificial construction. I had forgotten this, but thankfully this line helped me remember.

Just as the habit does not make the monk, the sceptre does not make the king.

What makes a monk, and what makes a king? Interesting questions.

I enjoyed this book because 
1. It reads fluidly and has a lot of action.
2. Examines the human condition.
3. Starts with a peculiar, but simple sci-fi concept that completely changes the contemporary universe.
