* The feeling you get when you get a Tweet lovin' your product.
* A happy "Thank you!" after solving a customer's technical problem.
* Realizing that your job is location independent and searching Google Maps for places to work remotely.
* Seeing your code on sanrio.com, full of cute hello kitties.
* Reading an unsolicited blog post praising your product and customer support.
* Coming up with interesting blog posts and writing and sharing them.
* Making enough money to say "no" to investors.
