What does it feel like to be in love again?

*Vulnerable*, as always. But this time is different because you can tell yourself with certainty that you can survive it. So this time, you enjoy the falling feeling and accept the uncertainty. You cherish the thrill and downplay your fears. But is it blindness, or experience? Who cares? You are in love. You wake up in the morning thinking about her smile, and there's nothing you can do about it but roll around in bed and remember how nice it was last night to relax on the couch and feel so comfortable with another person, to tell them anything, when even our stupidest jokes get laughed at, because in the moment it is truly funny.

*Uplifting*, as always. All of the little details about her physical and emotional attractiveness draw you upward like a thousand little magnets accelerating you into the sky, until you hit the top and attach immovably. Nothing can pull you down: Not even forgetting where you put your keys, or the mess your roommate left in the sink, or even stepping on a particularly sticky glob of sidewalk gum. Everything slides off like the rain beading off the back of a duck. So you walk with your head held high, knowing and trusting that the world must have your back today.

*Intoxicating*, as always. It seems that every moment is spent with a second mental process relentlessly thinking about her. It cannot be stopped, like a massive iceberg plowing through the pool of your mind, it displaces your thoughts in unexpected ways. Like, the moments you're accidentally smiling and realizing that at this very moment there is another person in the universe that you care deeply about and that nothing and nobody can stop you from feeling that way.

But I have lied when I said, "as always", as it's always different in small ways that are actually big ways. We found each other at a distinct point in time, when we are dealing with unique problems that we will only face in our early twenties. And we found each other in a distinct place, San Francisco, a city that we may never see again after a decade. And even the distinct order of each feeling, first the excitement, then the comfort. Whereas before it was the reverse. You hope that maybe this time, you will roll the dice and you will be happy. But then you remember it's better not to expect anything and enjoy the moment. Because expectation leads to regret: No expectations, no regrets.
