Autonomy, mastery, purpose.

Several months ago, I watched an [RSA Animate video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) that put those words in my head, and I have remembered those words since. These were the words used to describe what motivates in the home and at the workplace. And they're in my mind because ever since I made the decision to begin my career by joining a startup instead of a big company, I've pulled these words into my mind in order to justify my own insecurities.

I imagine my friends look at me and wonder why I would give up the high salary, the brand recognition, and presteige of working for an established company for starting my own project with a couple of friends. Until recently, I occasionally had these doubts as well. But after working for a startup for the past year, I can more confidently push these doubts aside, seeing how much our team has achieved.

However, taking the path that I took has its tradeoffs, and with this post I hope to clarify some of the stereotypes surrounding working in a startup.

Stereotypes

* Glamor - The impression that startups are about changing the world with grand visions, impressive offices, zany perks, rapid growth, and unlimited VC cash
* Hacker Romance - All nighters every night, continuous coffee-infused hackathon jam sessions, drinking and brogramming into the early morn.
* Sad Grinding - Same as "Hacker Romance", but without the smiles, and with late 20-somethings instead of early 20-somethings

Our team's venture so far has not been any of these things, but that hasn't kept us from finding personal meaning in what we do. I can't speak on behalf of the other members of the team, but I can share my personal evaluation of how my experience with [Tint](http://www.tintup.com) has measured up compared to my internship at Yahoo! last summer?
