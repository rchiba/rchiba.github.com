		<h1 class="post-title">About</h1>
        <p>
        I’m the cofounder of <a href="https://www.tintup.com" target="_blank">TINT</a>, a 30 person marketing technology company in San Francisco. We help organizations display beautiful, authentic stories crafted by real people for real people.

        <p>
        Over the past half-decade I’ve learned how to to take an idea from the <a href="https://vimeo.com/54399385" target="_blank">basement</a> of a university library to <a href="http://gallery.tintup.com/" target="_blank">a self sustaining business</a>. I’ve filled a multitude of roles: full stack web developer, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-ingenious-ways-to-increase-traffic-to-a-website/answer/Ryo-Chiba" target="_blank">growth hacker</a>, <a href="http://www.tintup.com/blog/how-to-recruit-engineers-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank">recruiter</a>, marketing manager, and company culture advocate. And in each role, I’ve had the privilege of working on what interests me: Creating a great place to work. 
        </p>
        <p>
I believe that the best team is going to create the best product, and the best teams come to great places to work.
