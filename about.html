		<p>
		My name is Ryo Chiba. I am a full stack developer who enjoys building useful things that make people happy. In 2012 I started a company with four other friends to build social aggregation tools. Experience with design, frontend development, backend development, dev ops, business analytics, and marketing with an interest in finding product-market fit and lean startup methodology. Graduated with a BS in Computer Engineering and MS in Computer Science in 2013 from the University of Southern California. Currently living in San Francisco.
