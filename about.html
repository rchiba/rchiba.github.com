    <p>Hi, I'm Ryo.</p>

    <h2>How do you pronounce my name?</h2>

    <p>I go by "Yo" as in "yo dog what's up".</p>

    <p>Aside: During a summer internship in college, I decided to try experimenting with a more American phonetic pronounciation, "rhee-o", and as a result, if I know you professionally, you probably pronounce my name like this which is totally correct because that's how I introduced myself. But, if you just met me, I probably introduced myself as "Yo".</p>

    <h2>But, like, how is it "actually" pronounced?</h2>

    <p>The actual "ry" sound in Japanese is most similar to the "d" sound in the American pronounciation of "ladder", but with the tongue in a similar place to when making an American "l" sound. Watch this video to learn more:</p>

    <p>If it's too hard, please consider using the easier-to-use pronounciation. Really, everyone calls me "yo", even my fianc√©e.</p>

    <h2>What's my story?</h2>

    <p>I was born in Japan, but came to the US when I was 1. My family traveled a lot growing up, and until college I lived mostly in the middle of America. I spent elementary school in Alabama and middle/high school in Indiana. For undergrad, I moved to Los Angeles, and graduated with a BS/MS in CS from USC in 2012. While in college, I cofounded a marketing technology company called <a href="" target="_blank">TINT</a>.</p>

    <p>We achieved great success, as we grew to 40 full-time employees, millions in annual recurring revenue, and 1000+ customers in 172 countries. During those 6 years, I alternated between CTO and Head of Marketing, and learned a great deal about software development, business operations, recruiting, management, leadership, and marketing. In 2018 we sold the company to <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/18/filestack-builds-enterprise-credentials-with-tint-acquisition" target="_blank">Filestack</a>. Now I'm working on my next venture with another TINT cofounder. It's called <a href="https://useapparatus.com/">Apparatus</a>, and it's software designed to help content marketers increase their organic traffic by optimizing their content for search.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy sketching, biking, and spending excessive amounts of time writing "about me" pages.</p>

    <h2>What can I do for you?</h2>

I can provide comprehensive competitive analysis, keyword research, run SEO experiments, and give recommendations to boost inbound traffic.</p>

    <p>If you are looking for insight, advice, or stories related to building a tech company from scratch to 40-people, please reach out. Happy to share experiences and knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Cyclist?</h3>

    <p>I'm a relatively casual cyclist usually riding with friends on weekends between 50-60 miles at 13 mph on a used Fuji Sportif. If you're in the Bay Area want to ride, let me know. </p>

    <h3>Sketcher?</h3>
