        <p>
I’m the cofounder of TINT, a 30 person marketing technology company in San Francisco. We help organizations display beautiful, authentic stories crafted by real people for real people.

        <p>
Over the past half-decade I’ve learned how to to take an idea from the basement of a university library to a self sustaining business. I’ve filled a multitude of roles: full stack web developer, growth hacker, recruiter, marketing manager, and company culture advocate. And in each role, I’ve had the privilege of working on what interests me: Creating a great place to work. 
        </p>
        <p>
I believe that the best team is going to create the best product, and the best teams come to great places to work.
