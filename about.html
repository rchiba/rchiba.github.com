        <h2>What's my story?</h2>

        <p>I was born in Japan, but came to the US at an early age. My family traveled a lot growing up, and my childhood was spent in the midwest. I moved to California and graduated from USC in 2012. While in college, I cofounded a marketing technology company called <a href="" target="_blank">TINT</a>.</p>

        <p>We achieved great success, as we grew to 40 full-time employees, millions in annual recurring revenue, and 1000+ customers in 172 countries. During those 6 years, I alternated between CTO and Head of Marketing, and learned a great deal about software development, business operations, recruiting, management, leadership, and marketing. In 2018 we sold the company to <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/18/filestack-builds-enterprise-credentials-with-tint-acquisition" target="_blank">Filestack</a>.</p>

        <p>Now I'm working on my next venture with my business partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilaitharaju/" target="_blank">Nik</a>. It's called <a href="https://www.usetopic.com/">Topic</a>, and it's software designed to help writers create higher quality content faster.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy sketching, biking, cooking.</p>
