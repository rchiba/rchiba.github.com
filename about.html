        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        
        <p>I'm an entrepreneur with two primary skillsets: the first as a full-stack developer with a focus on the front-end, the second as a digital marketer with a focus on organic search. I've founded and exited two SaaS businesses.</p>

        <h2>Longer Version</h2>

        <p>My professional journey started in 2012 when I cofounded a social network called <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/usc-students-launch-hypemarks-2012-7" target="_blank">Hypemarks</a>, which we eventually pivoted to a B2B marketing technology company called <a href="https://tintup.com/" target="_blank">TINT</a>.</p>

        <p>We grew to 40 full-time employees, 5M in annual recurring revenue, and 1000+ customers in 172 countries. During those 6 years, I alternated between CTO and Head of Marketing, and learned a great deal about software development, business operations, recruiting, management, leadership, and marketing. In 2018 we sold the company to <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/18/filestack-builds-enterprise-credentials-with-tint-acquisition" target="_blank">Filestack</a>.</p>

        <p>From 2019 to 2021, I worked with my business partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilaitharaju/" target="_blank">Nik</a> to take what we learned growing our company to create a tool called <a href="https://www.usetopic.com/">Topic</a>. It's software designed to help writers create higher quality content faster. 250+ customers and <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/topic-topic/reviews" target="_blank">many 5-star G2 reviews</a> later, we sold the company to <a href="https://cafemedia.com/" target="_blank">CafeMedia</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm now at <a href="https://cafemedia.com/" target="_blank">CafeMedia</a>/<a href="https://adthrive.com/" target="_blank">AdThrive</a> helping thousands of popular food, home, and lifestyle publishers rank higher in search.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy sketching, biking, cooking.</p>
